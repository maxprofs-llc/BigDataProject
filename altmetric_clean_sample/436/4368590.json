Chinese medical constitutions were classified and quantitatively scored. The highest grading for any item of adverse reactions in each case during the whole chemotherapy course was recorded after chemotherapy. Data were statistically analyzed using SPSS16.0.\nThere was no significant difference in CIL between different chemotherapy regimens and various Chinese medical constitutions of breast cancer patients (P > 0.05). Yang deficiency constitution is one risk factor for CIL. The higher the score of yang deficiency constitution, the more severe the CIL.\nYang deficiency constitution was correlated with the degree of CIL. The higher the score of yang deficiency constitution, the greater the risk of III-IV grade CIL in breast cancer patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9283cf058f61000dd2f","authors":["Liu, Yi","Chen, Qing-hua","Sun, Ye","Cai, Yun","Wang, Rui","Han, Ping-ping","Zhang, Zhe","Wang, Rui","Ye, Feng"],"first_seen_on":"2015-08-06T10:27:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1003-5370"],"issue":"6","journal":"Zhongguo Zhong xi yi jie he za zhi Zhongguo Zhongxiyi jiehe zazhi Chinese journal of integrated traditional and Western medicine","last_mentioned_on":1438856796,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26242115?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26242115","pubdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"[Relation between Chinese Medical Constitutions and Chemotherapy-induced Leucopenia in Breast Cancer Patients: a Clinical Study].","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/relation-between-chinese-medical-constitutions-chemotherapyinduced-leucopenia-breast-cancer-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5450554,"mean":6.3470462938347,"rank":4535823,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5450554,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190039,"mean":8.8711592102632,"rank":152294,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190039,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187,"mean":0.92713978494624,"rank":82,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":2.53125,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/status\/629237126912028673","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4368590],"posted_on":"2015-08-06T10:26:36+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":713},"tweet_id":"629237126912028673"}]}}
