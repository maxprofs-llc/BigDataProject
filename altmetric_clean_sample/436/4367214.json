When searching for the coexpression genes, the data mining process is largely affected by selection of algorithms. Thus, it is highly desirable to provide multiple options of algorithms in the user-friendly analytical toolkit to explore the gene expression signatures. For this purpose, we developed GESearch, an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit, which is written in MATLAB and supports a variety of gene expression data files. This analytical toolkit provides four models, including the mean, the regression, the delegate, and the ensemble models, to identify the coexpression genes, and enables the users to filter data and to select gene expression patterns by browsing the display window or by importing knowledge-based genes. Subsequently, the utility of this analytical toolkit is demonstrated by analyzing two sets of real-life microarray datasets from cell-cycle experiments. Overall, we have developed an interactive GUI toolkit that allows for choosing multiple algorithms for analyzing the gene expression signatures.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef852a83ee09648b548f","authors":["Ye, Ning","Yin, Hengfu","Liu, Jingjing","Dai, Xiaogang","Yin, Tongming"],"doi":"10.1155\/2015\/853734","first_seen_on":"2015-08-06T03:45:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2314-6141"],"journal":"BioMed Research International","last_mentioned_on":1438880150,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26199946"],"pmid":"26199946","title":"GESearch: An Interactive GUI Tool for Identifying Gene Expression Signature.","type":"article","volume":"2015","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gesearch-interactive-gui-tool-identifying-gene-expression-signature"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5450695,"mean":6.347149723687,"rank":2262269,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3100531,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5450695,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190071,"mean":8.8718076392909,"rank":74306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":112023,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190071,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3576,"mean":2.5121555244755,"rank":703,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":2801,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3576,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":315,"mean":2.046872611465,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":246,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":315,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":3},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4,"Computer Science":4,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IN":2},"mendeley":{"BR":2,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/LeucineRichBio\/status\/629136216634585088","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4367214],"posted_on":"2015-08-06T03:45:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Leucine Rich Bio","url":"http:\/\/www.leucinerichbio.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/758354770432106496\/9VhuRBEI_normal.jpg","description":"Experience the Next Generation Analysis #Cancer #RareDiseases #PersonalizedMedicine #Sequencing #Genomics","id_on_source":"LeucineRichBio","tweeter_id":"434875052","geo":{"lt":12.97194,"ln":77.59369,"country":"IN"},"followers":1671},"tweet_id":"629136216634585088"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PrabhathKM1\/status\/629335083019730944","license":"datasift","rt":["LeucineRichBio"],"citation_ids":[4367214],"posted_on":"2015-08-06T16:55:50+00:00","author":{"name":"Prabhath K M","url":"http:\/\/www.leucinerichbio.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/641998935586811904\/-o3iodCb_normal.png","description":"Director @LeucineRichBio, Dreamer, Likes..
