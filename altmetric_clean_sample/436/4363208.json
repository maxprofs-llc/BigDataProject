However, little is known about the potential role of adipose tissue in heart failure (HF) and the aim of this study was to investigate epicardial (EAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) in HF patients.\nThirty patients with systolic HF and 30 patients with normal systolic function undergoing thoracic surgery were included in the study. Plasma was sampled and examined with ELISA analyses, whereas SAT and EAT biopsies were collected and examined with RT-PCR and gas chromatography. Significantly higher expression of mRNA encoding interleukin-6, adrenomedullin, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b1, and fatty acid-binding protein-3, as well as higher levels of monounsaturated FA (MUFA) and palmitoleic acid were seen in EAT of HF patients, whereas the levels of docosahexaenoic acid were lower. Palmitoleic acid levels in EAT were correlated with two parameters of cardiac remodeling, increasing left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and NT-proBNP.\nOur results demonstrate adipose tissue depot-specific alterations of synthesis of FA and inflammatory and metabolic mediators in systolic HF patients. EAT may be a source of increased circulatory and myocardial levels of these mediators through endocrine actions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a02","authors":["Fosshaug, Linn E","Dahl, Christen P","Risnes, Ivar","Bohov, Pavol","Berge, Rolf K","Nymo, St\u00e5le","Geiran, Odd","Yndestad, Arne","Gullestad, Lars","Aukrust, P\u00e5l","Vinge, Leif E","\u00d8ie, Erik"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cardfail.2015.07.014","first_seen_on":"2015-08-05T06:23:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-8414","10719164","1071-9164"],"journal":"Journal of Cardiac Failure","last_mentioned_on":1447879607,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1071916415006302?_docanchor=&_fmt=high&_origin=gateway&_rdoc=1&md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1071916415006302"],"pmid":"26231517","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Altered Levels of Fatty Acids and Inflammatory and Metabolic Mediators in Epicardial Adipose Tissue in Patients With Systolic Heart Failure","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/altered-levels-fatty-acids-inflammatory-metabolic-mediators-epicardial-adipose-tissue-patients-systo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6581713,"mean":6.1066319197804,"rank":4627735,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1712578,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6581713,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197917,"mean":8.9415353382245,"rank":128037,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":60378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197917,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":448,"mean":4.9920089485459,"rank":306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":448,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":0.95357142857143,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
