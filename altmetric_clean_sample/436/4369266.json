Fifteen subjects, aged between 39 and 75\u2009years old, were randomly assigned to the dual-task training group (n\u2009=\u20098) and single-task training group (n\u2009=\u20097). The training was run twice a week for 6\u2009weeks. The single-task group received balance training and the dual-task group performed cognitive tasks simultaneously with the balance training. There were no significant differences between the two groups at baseline. After the intervention, the results for mediolateral sway with eyes closed were significantly better for the dual-task group and anteroposterior sway with eyes closed was significantly better for the single-task group. The results suggest superior outcomes for the dual-task training compared to the single-task training for static postural control, except in anteroposterior sway with eyes closed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5333cf058f6100045e1","authors":["\u00c2ngela Fernandes"],"doi":"10.3109\/08990220.2014.1002605","first_seen_on":"2015-08-06T13:47:08+00:00","issns":["1369-1651"],"journal":"Somatosensory & Motor Research","last_mentioned_on":1438870107,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.3109\/08990220.2014.1002605"],"pmid":"25874637","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"Effects of dual-task training on balance and executive functions in Parkinson's disease: A pilot study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-dualtask-training-balance-executive-functions-parkinsons-disease-pilot-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5450695,"mean":6.347149723687,"rank":3836685,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":914767,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5450695,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190070,"mean":8.8718432674451,"rank":131393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":37755,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190070,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":2.1705357142857,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.25,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
