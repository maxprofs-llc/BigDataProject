Naturalistic stimuli, such as movies, closely mimic the real world and provide a window onto the brain's ability to respond in a timely and measured fashion to complex, everyday events. Young adults respond to these stimuli in a highly synchronized fashion, but it remains to be seen how age affects neural responsiveness during naturalistic viewing. To this end, we scanned a large (N\u00a0= 218), population-based sample from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) during movie-watching. Intersubject synchronization declined with age, such that older adults' response to the movie was more idiosyncratic. This decreased synchrony related to cognitive measures sensitive to attentional control. Our findings suggest that neural responsivity changes with age, which likely has important implications for real-world event comprehension and memory.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f61000318e","authors":["Campbell, Karen L","Shafto, Meredith A","Wright, Paul","Tsvetanov, Kamen A","Geerligs, Linda","Cusack, Rhodri",", ","Tyler, Lorraine K","Karen L.
