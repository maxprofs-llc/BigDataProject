We review the available data on chromosomal polymorphisms in mammals so as to identify taxa that hold promise for developing a more comprehensive understanding of chromosomal change. In doing so, we address several key questions: (i) to what extent are mammalian karyotypes polymorphic, and what types of rearrangements are principally involved? (ii) Are some mammalian lineages more prone to chromosomal polymorphism than others? More specifically, do (karyotypically) polymorphic mammalian species belong to lineages that are also characterized by past, extensive karyotype repatterning? (iii) How long can chromosomal polymorphisms persist in mammals? We discuss the evolutionary implications of these questions and propose several research avenues that may shed light on the role of chromosome change in the diversification of mammalian populations and species.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023dc","authors":["Dobigny, Gauthier","Britton-Davidian, Janice","Robinson, Terence J","Britton\u2010Davidian, Janice","Robinson, Terence J."],"doi":"10.1111\/brv.12213","endpage":"n\/a","first_seen_on":"2015-08-04T14:39:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1469-185X"],"journal":"Biological Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1439006406,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26234165?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26234165","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/brv.12213\/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/brv.12213\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/brv.12213\/pdf","pmid":"26234165","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"n\/a","subjects":["biology"],"title":"Chromosomal polymorphism in mammals: an evolutionary perspective","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chromosomal-polymorphism-mammals-evolutionary-perspective"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6407634,"mean":5.9857722172913,"rank":2360031,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":3951943,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6407634,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190121,"mean":8.9257818220072,"rank":73410,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":112873,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190121,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":549,"mean":10.251952554745,"rank":398,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":141,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":549,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":16.303066666667,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
