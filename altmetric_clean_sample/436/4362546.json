In this study, a novel polyvinylpyrrolidone K-30\/sodium dodecyl sulfate and polyethyleneglycol-coated liposome loaded with CC flavonoids (CCFs) was developed to enhance solubility and the antibrain tumor effect, and the molecular mechanism regarding how CCF nanoliposomes (CCF-NLs) induce apoptotic cell death in vitro was investigated. DBTRG-05MG GBM cell lines treated with CCF-NLs showed potential antiproliferative effects. Regarding the underlying mechanisms of inducing apoptosis in DBTRG-05MG GBM cells, CCF-NLs were shown to downregulate the expression of antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma\/leukemia 2 (Bcl-2), an apoptosis-related protein family member, but the expression of proapoptotic Bcl-2-associated X protein was enhanced compared with that in controls. CCF-NLs also inhibited the activity of caspase-3 and -9, which is the initiator caspase of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Blockade of caspase activation consistently induced apoptosis and inhibited growth in CCF-NL-treated DBTRG-05MG cells. This study further investigated the role of the Akt pathway in the apoptotic cell death by CCF-NLs, showing that CCF-NLs deactivated Akt. Specifically, CCF-NLs downregulated the expression of p-Akt and SIRT1 as well as the level of phosphorylated p53. Together, these results indicated SIRT1\/p53-mediated cell death was induced by CCF-NLs, but not by extracellular signal-regulated kinase, in DBTRG-05MG cells. Overall, this study suggested caspase-dependent activation of both the intrinsic and extrinsic signaling pathways, probably through blockade of the SIRT1\/p53-mediated mitochondrial and Akt pathways to exert the proapoptotic effect of CCF-NLs in DBTRG-05MG GBM cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f610007966","authors":["Wang Gang","Zhao HuaFu","Tang HongMing","Wang Jing","Wang JunJie","Wang, Gang","Wang, Jun Jie","To, Tony Ss","Zhao, Hua Fu","Wang, Jing"],"doi":"10.2147\/ijn.s82282","first_seen_on":"2015-08-05T00:39:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1178-2013"],"journal":"International Journal of Nanomedicine","last_mentioned_on":1472743384,"links":["http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/role-of-sirt1-mediated-mitochondrial-and-akt-pathways-in-glioblastoma--peer-reviewed-article-IJN","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26345416?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=26311","pmid":"26345416","pubdate":"2015-08-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"5005","subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Role of SIRT1-mediated mitochondrial and Akt pathways in glioblastoma cell death induced by <em>Cotinus coggygria<\/em> flavonoid nanoliposomes","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-sirt1mediated-mitochondrial-akt-pathways-glioblastoma-cell-death-induced-cotinus-coggygria-flav"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8314034,"mean":7.0059620328577,"rank":3936764,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4192482,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8314034,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230737,"mean":8.5956762013729,"rank":100774,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":121677,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230737,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1816,"mean":2.562276584022,"rank":539,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":1134,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1816,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":140,"mean":1.9017985611511,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":74,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":140,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
