Anatomical landmarks (ALs) were palpated in specific bony areas of the femur (shaft, condyles, neck and head). QS were then created from the surface vertices which enclose these ALs. The diaphyseal shaft was divided into five QS shapes to analyse curvature in different parts of the shaft.\nFemoral bending differs in different parts of the diaphyseal shaft. The greatest degree of curvature was found in the distal shaft (mean 4.5\u00b0 range 0.2\u00b0-10\u00b0) followed by the proximal (mean 4.4\u00b0 range 1.5\u00b0-10.2\u00b0), proximal intermediate (mean 3.7\u00b0 range 0.9\u00b0-7.9\u00b0) and distal intermediate (mean 1.8\u00b0 range 0.2\u00b0-5.6\u00b0) shaft sections. The proximal and distal angles were significantly more bowed than the intermediate proximal and the intermediate distal angle. There was no significant difference between the proximal and distal angle. No significant correlations were found between morphological characteristics and femoral curvature. An extremely large variability of femoral curvature with several bones displaying very high or low degrees of femoral curvature was also found.\n3D QS fitting enables the creation of accurate models which can discriminate between different patterns in similar curvatures and demonstrates there is a clear difference between curvature in different parts of the shaft.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100035f6","authors":["Tara Chapman","Victor Sholukha","Patrick Semal","St\u00e9phane Louryan","Marcel Rooze","Serge Van Sint Jan"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00276-015-1495-7","first_seen_on":"2015-08-06T04:48:06+00:00","issns":["1279-8517"],"journal":"Surgical & Radiologic Anatomy","last_mentioned_on":1433757392,"links":["https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/277781344_Femoral_curvature_variability_in_modern_humans_using_three-dimensional_quadric_surface_fitting"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Stephane_Louryan\/publication\/277781344_Femoral_curvature_variability_in_modern_humans_using_three-dimensional_quadric_surface_fitting\/links\/5593ae6208ae16f493ee7cbc.pdf","pmid":"26040401","pubdate":"2015-06-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Anatomy","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Imaging \/ Radiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Orthopedics","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["radiology","anatomy","generalsurgery"],"title":"Femoral curvature variability in modern humans using three-dimensional quadric surface fitting","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/femoral-curvature-variability-modern-humans-using-threedimensional-quadric-surface-fitting"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5204448,"mean":6.1397495691689,"rank":4332758,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5204448,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":183986,"mean":8.8936342527925,"rank":147466,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":183986,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240,"mean":1.7806192468619,"rank":198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Femoral curvature variability in modern humans using three-dimensional quadric surface fitting.","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=919845688038205&id=612587498764027","license":"public","citation_ids":[4367441],"posted_on":"2015-06-08T09:56:32+00:00","summary":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/277781344_Femoral_curvature_variability_in_modern_humans_using_three-dimensional_quadric_surface_fitting","author":{"name":"Polska Antropologia Fizyczna","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/612587498764027","facebook_wall_name":"Polska Antropologia Fizyczna","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/612587498764027\/picture","id_on_source":"612587498764027"}}]}}
