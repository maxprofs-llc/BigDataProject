DELLAs are members of the plant-specific GRAS protein family and act as repressors of GA signaling. DELLAs are rapidly degraded in the presence of GAs. GA-GID1-DELLA complexes are recognized and ubiquitinated by the SCF(SLY) complex. The sleepy1 (sly1) F-box mutant exhibits dwarfism and low-germination phenotypes due to high accumulation of DELLAs. Overexpression of GID1 in the sly1 mutant partially rescues these phenotypes without degradation of DELLAs suggesting that proteolysis independent regulation of DELLAs exists in GA signaling. But the molecular mechanisms of non-proteolytic regulation of DELLA are largely unknown. Recently we identified a DELLA binding transcription factor, GAI-ASSOCIATED FACTOR1 (GAF1). GAF1 also interacts with co-repressor TOPLESS RELATED (TPR) in nuclei. DELLAs and TPR act as coactivator and corepressor of GAF1, respectively. GAs converts the GAF1 complex from transcriptional activator to repressor via degradation of DELLAs. The overexpression of \u0394PAM, lacking of DELLAs binding region of GAF1, partially rescue dwarf phenotypes of GA deficient or GA insensitive mutant. In this study, we investigate the relationship between non-proteolytic regulation of DELLAs and GA signaling via DELLA-GAF1complex using modified yeast two hybrid system.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008547","authors":["Fukazawa, Jutarou","Ito, Takeshi","Kamiya, Yuji","Yamaguchi, Shinjiro","Takahashi, Yohsuke"],"doi":"10.1080\/15592324.2015.1052923","first_seen_on":"2015-08-04T10:26:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1559-2324"],"journal":"Plant Signaling & Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1438683964,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26237582?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26237582","pubdate":"2015-08-04T22:00:10+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Horticultural Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["botany"],"title":"Binding of GID1 to DELLAs Promotes Dissociation of GAF1 from DELLA in GA Dependent Manner.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/binding-gid1-dellas-promotes-dissociation-gaf1-della-ga-dependent-manner"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5441501,"mean":6.3354329096722,"rank":4528194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5441501,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189876,"mean":8.8569472969058,"rank":152163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189876,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":634,"mean":1.4505402843602,"rank":359,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":634,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":1.0918032786885,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
