Selective inhibition of pathological thrombosis holds the key to treat variety of thrombotic diseases. The pathological thrombosis can be induced by either tissue necrosis and deregulated inflammation. HMGB1, as an important proinflammatory cytokine and a late mediator, also involves on thrombosis disease. However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood.\nImmunofluorescence, ELISA assay, Platelet Aggregation, Thromboelastogram (TEG) analyzes. Flow cytometric analysis and Western blot analysis were used to investigated the role of HMGB1 in platelet aggregation and obtained following observations.\nBy doing so, we obtained the following observations: i) Highly purified HMGB1 recombinant protein induces platelet aggregation and secretion in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of serum. ii) Low concentration of extracellular HMGB1 could synergistically promote subthreshold concentration of collagen or thrombin induced platelet aggregation. iii) Extracellular HMGB1 promoted platelet aggregation in a platelet-expressed GPIIb\/IIIa-dependent manner. iv) We proposed that extracellular HMGB1 seems to promote the phosphorylation of GPIIb\/IIIa and subsequent platelet aggregation via TLR4\/NF-\u03baB and cGMP pathway.\nIn this study, we provide evidence for the hypothesis that HMGB1 interact with platelet might play an important role in the haemostasis and thrombotic diseases. Our research might be provide an interesting avenue for the treatment of thrombotic diseases in the future.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000808","authors":["Xinyu Yang","Haichao Wang","Menmen Zhang","Jin Liu","Ben Lv","Fangping Chen"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13000-015-0348-3","first_seen_on":"2015-08-06T13:47:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1746-1596"],"issue":"1","journal":"Diagnostic Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1438868831,"links":["http:\/\/www.diagnosticpathology.org\/content\/10\/1\/134"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.diagnosticpathology.org\/content\/pdf\/s13000-015-0348-3.pdf","pmid":"26245198","pubdate":"2015-08-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pathology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology"],"title":"HMGB1: a novel protein that induced platelets active and aggregation via Toll-like receptor-4, NF-\u03baB and cGMP dependent mechanisms","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hmgb1-novel-protein-induced-platelets-active-aggregation-via-tolllike-receptor4-nf%CE%BAb-cgmp-dependent"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5450695,"mean":6.347149723687,"rank":2896554,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1851701,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5450695,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190064,"mean":8.8721972609083,"rank":103614,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":67918,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190064,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":621,"mean":1.9629096774194,"rank":293,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":256,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":621,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85,"mean":2.694,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
