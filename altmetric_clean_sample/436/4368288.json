However, esophagectomy is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Endoscopic radical resection followed by thoracolaparoscopic LN dissection without concomitant esophagectomy could be an alternative. The study aim was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of thoracolaparoscopic dissection of esophageal LNs in a preclinical setting. (i) In human cadavers, thoracolaparoscopic dissection of LNs involved in drainage of the esophagus was performed. Subsequently, esophagectomy was performed to be able to detect retained LNs. Outcome parameters included the number of dissected LNs, the number of retained LNs in the esophagectomy specimen (ES), and technical success. (ii) In swine, thoracolaparoscopic LN dissection was also performed. After the procedure, the swine survived for 28 days. Thereafter, the swine were sacrificed and esophagectomy was performed. Outcome parameters included the presence of ischemia and\/or stenosis in the ES and other complications. (i) In five human cadavers, a median of 26 LNs (interquartile range 22-46) were dissected. In two ES, one retained LN was found: one high paraesophageal, one low paraesophageal. Technical success rate was 100%. (ii) None of the seven porcine ES showed signs of ischemia or stenosis. One swine died because of ventricular fibrillation during surgery; during follow up no complications were observed. Thoracolaparoscopic dissection of LNs involved in the drainage of the esophagus is feasible in human cadavers and swine. The porcine survival study suggests that the esophageal vascularity is not severely compromised by the procedure. As anatomy differs between swine and humans, safety of the procedure will have to be investigated thoroughly before applying this new technique as the treatment of choice.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000271e","authors":["K\u00fcnzli, H","van Berge Henegouwen, M","Gisbertz, S","Seldenrijk, C","Kuijpers, K","Bergman, J","Wiezer, M","Weusten, B"],"doi":"10.1111\/dote.12395","first_seen_on":"2015-08-06T10:04:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1442-2050"],"journal":"Diseases of the Esophagus","last_mentioned_on":1438855457,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26228037?dopt=abstract"],"pmid":"26228037","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Thoracolaparoscopic dissection of esophageal lymph nodes without esophagectomy is feasible in human cadavers and safe in a porcine survival study.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/thoracolaparoscopic-dissection-esophageal-lymph-nodes-without-esophagectomy-feasible-human-cadavers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5450695,"mean":6.347149723687,"rank":3836672,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":914772,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5450695,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190071,"mean":8.8718150049983,"rank":131395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":37753,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190071,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229,"mean":1.3416228070175,"rank":95,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":94,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.1833333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
