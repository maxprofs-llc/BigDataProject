C1q\/TNF-related protein (CTRP) 9 is an adipokine that is downregulated by obesity. We investigated the role of CTRP9 in cardiac injury with loss-of-function genetic manipulations, and defined the receptor-mediated signaling pathway downstream of this adipokine. CTRP9-knockout (CTRP9-KO) mice at the age of 12 weeks were indistinguishable from wild-type (WT) mice under basal conditions. CTRP9-KO mice had exacerbated contractile left ventricle dysfunction following intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) compared with WT mice. Administration of LPS to CTRP9-KO mice also resulted in increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers in the heart compared with WT mice. Likewise, CTRP9-KO mice showed increased myocardial infarct size and elevated expression of inflammatory mediators in ischemic heart following ischemia-reperfusion compared with WT mice. Treatment of cardiac myocytes with CTRP9 protein led to suppression of LPS-induced expression of pro-inflammatory genes, which was reversed by blockade of AMPK or ablation of adiponectin-receptor type1 (AdipoR1). Systemic delivery of CTRP9 attenuated LPS-induced cardiac dysfunction in WT mice, but not in muscle-specific transgenic mice expressing dominant-negative mutant form of AMPK or AdipoR1-knockout mice. CTRP9 protects against acute cardiac damage in response to pathological stimuli by suppressing inflammatory reactions through AdipoR1\/AMPK-dependent mechanisms.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f61000310d","authors":["Kambara, Takahiro","Shibata, Rei","Ohashi, Koji","Matsuo, Kazuhiro","Hiramatsu-Ito, Mizuho","Enomoto, Takashi","Yuasa, Daisuke","Ito, Masanori","Hayakawa, Satoko","Ogawa, Hayato","Aprahamian, Tamar","Walsh, Kenneth","Murohara, Toyoaki","Ouchi, Noriyuki"],"doi":"10.1128\/mcb.01518-14","first_seen_on":"2015-08-05T21:11:14+00:00","issns":["1098-5549"],"journal":"Molecular & Cellular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1438809034,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25870106?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25870106","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"C1q\/TNF-related protein 9 protects against acute myocardial injury through an AdipoR1-AMPK dependent mechanism.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/c1qtumor-necrosis-factorrelated-protein-9-protects-against-acute-myocardial-injury-through-adiponect"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5446629,"mean":6.3432151099742,"rank":4532595,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5446629,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189783,"mean":8.8636077183295,"rank":152054,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189783,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3466,"mean":2.8438943722944,"rank":3209,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3466,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":3.3832727272727,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
