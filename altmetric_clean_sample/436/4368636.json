Using a Toxoplasma vaccination model, we delineate the sequence of events that na\u00efve CD8(+) T cells undergo to become terminal effectors and the differentiation steps controlled by IL-12. We demonstrate that direct IL-12 signaling on CD8(+) T cells is essential for the induction of KLRG1 and IFN-\u03b3, but the subsequent downregulation of CXCR3 is controlled by IL-12 indirectly through the actions of IFN-\u03b3 and IFN-\u03b3-inducible chemokines. Differentiation of nascent effectors occurs in an extrafollicular splenic compartment and is driven by late IL-12 production by DCs distinct from the classical CD8\u03b1(+) DC. Unexpectedly, we also found extensive proliferation of both KLRG1(-) and KLRG1(+) CD8(+) T cells in the marginal zone and red pulp, which ceases prior to the final KLRG1(Hi) CXCR3(Lo) stage. Our findings highlight the notion of an extrafollicular pathway for effector T cell generation.","altmetric_jid":"560420b12a83eea5738b4567","authors":["Shah, Suhagi","Grotenbreg, Gijsbert M","Rivera, Amariliz","Yap, George S"],"doi":"10.7554\/elife.09017","first_seen_on":"2015-08-06T10:32:36+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid"],"issns":["2050-084X"],"journal":"eLife","last_mentioned_on":1438947360,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26244629?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26244629?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26244629","pubdate":"2015-08-06T22:00:13+00:00","title":"An extrafollicular pathway for the generation of effector CD8(+) T cells driven by the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-12.","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/extrafollicular-pathway-generation-effector-cd8t-cells-driven-proinflammatory-cytokine-il12"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.258,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.258},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5452853,"mean":6.3483694437341,"rank":772839,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":4679776,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5452853,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190287,"mean":8.8663987156176,"rank":35852,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":154417,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190287,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2599,"mean":25.656313317937,"rank":1188,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":1411,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2599,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259,"mean":25.937782945736,"rank":132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259,"percentile":49}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
