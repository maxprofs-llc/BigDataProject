Plant hormones jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) are major regulators of plant response to pathogen attack. However, there is little information about the interactive effect of both elicitors on inducing GS biosynthesis in Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa ssp. pekinensis). In this study, we applied different concentrations of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and\/or SA onto the leaf and root of Chinese cabbage to investigate the time-course interactive profiles of GSs. Regardless of the site of the elicitation and the concentrations of the elicitors, the roots accumulated much more GSs and were more sensitive and more rapidly responsive to the elicitors than leaves. Irrespective of the elicitation site, MeJA had a greater inducing and longer lasting effect on GS accumulation than SA. All three components of indole GS (IGS) were detected along with aliphatic and aromatic GSs. However, IGS was a major component of total GSs that accumulated rapidly in both root and leaf tissues in response to MeJA and SA elicitation. Neoglucobrassicin (neoGBC) did not respond to SA but to MeJA in leaf tissue, while it responded to both SA and MeJA in root tissue. Conversion of glucobrassicin (GBC) to neoGBC occurred at a steady rate over 3 d of elicitation. Increased accumulation of 4-methoxy glucobrassicin (4-MGBC) occurred only in the root irrespective of the type of elicitors and the site of elicitation. Thus, accumulation of IGS is a major metabolic hallmark of SA- and MeJA-mediated systemic response systems. SA exerted an antagonistic effect on the MeJA-induced root GSs irrespective of the site of elicitation. However, SA showed synergistic and antagonistic effects on the MeJA-induced leaf GSs when roots and leaves are elicitated for 3 d, respectively.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f34","authors":["Zang, Yun-Xiang","Ge, Jia-Li","Huang, Ling-Hui","Gao, Fei","Lv, Xi-Shan","Zheng, Wei-Wei","Hong, Seung-Beom","Zhu, Zhu-Jun"],"doi":"10.1631\/jzus.b1400370","first_seen_on":"2015-08-05T10:28:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1862-1783"],"issue":"8","journal":"Journal of Zhejiang University - Science B","last_mentioned_on":1438770455,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26238545?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26238545","pubdate":"2015-08-05T22:01:13+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Veterinary","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","biology"],"title":"Leaf and root glucosinolate profiles of Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa ssp. pekinensis) as a systemic response to methyl jasmonate and salicylic acid elicitation.","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/leaf-root-glucosinolate-profiles-chinese-cabbage-brassica-rapa-ssp-pekinensis-systemic-response-meth"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5446629,"mean":6.3432151099742,"rank":4532582,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5446629,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189782,"mean":8.8636309746498,"rank":152051,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189782,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":205,"mean":3.1927843137255,"rank":134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":205,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.62272727272727,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
