Try direct rather than via DOI"],"citation":{"abstract":"The results obtained by employing a usual technique for latent prints development on firearms are presented. A fingermark on a trigger was enhanced and this print was used to identify the person who handled the firearm. Indeed, it is not usual to find a useful fingermark in that position and, more in general, on firearms because of many different factors described in the following sections. The uniqueness of the results reported in this paper allow to consider the present casework as very interesting for the forensic community.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002900","authors":["Amata, B","Aprea, G M","Chiuri, A","Zampa, F"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.forsciint.2015.05.024","first_seen_on":"2015-08-05T11:25:40+00:00","issns":["1872-6283","03790738"],"journal":"Forensic Science International","last_mentioned_on":1438773908,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0379073815002170"],"pmid":"26055307","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["jurisprudence"],"title":"Fingerprint on trigger: A real case ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fingerprint-trigger-real-case"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5446629,"mean":6.3432151099742,"rank":2894129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1850506,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5446629,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189784,"mean":8.8635992159467,"rank":103409,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":67839,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189784,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1501,"mean":3.2405973333333,"rank":810,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":536,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1501,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73,"mean":1.5129166666667,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
