Sulfatase 1 (SULF1) functions as a tumor suppressor in HCC cell lines in vitro, but also has an oncogenic effect in some HCCs in vivo.\nTo examine the mechanisms regulating SULF1 and its function in HCC.\nFirst, SULF1 mRNA and protein expression were examined. Second, we examined SULF1 gene copy number in HCC cells. Third, we assessed whether DNA methylation or methylation and\/or acetylation of histone marks on the promoter regulate SULF1 expression. Finally, we examined the effect of 5-Aza-dC on sulfatase activity and drug-induced apoptosis.\nSULF1 mRNA was down-regulated in 9\/11 HCC cell lines but only 6\/10 primary tumors. SULF1 mRNA correlated with protein expression. Gene copy number assessment by fluorescence in situ hybridization showed intact SULF1 alleles in low SULF1 expressing cell lines. CpG island methylation in the SULF1 promoter and two downstream CpG islands did not show an inverse correlation between DNA methylation and SULF1 expression. However, chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that the SULF1 promoter acquires a silenced chromatin state in low SULF1-expressing cells through an increase in di\/trimethyl-K9H3 and trimethyl-K27H3 and a concomitant loss of activating acetyl K9, K14H3 marks. 5-Aza-dC restored SULF1 mRNA expression in SULF1-negative cell lines, with an associated increase in sulfatase activity and sensitization of HCC cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis.\nSULF1 gene silencing in HCC occurs through histone modifications on the SULF1 promoter. Restoration of SULF1 mRNA expression by 5-Aza-dC sensitized HCC cells to drug-induced apoptosis.","authors":["Shire, Abdirashid","Lomberk, Gwen","Lai, Jin-Ping","Zou, Hongzhi","Tsuchiya, Norihiko","Aderca, Ileana","Moser, Catherine D","Gulaid, Kadra H","Oseini, Abdul","Hu, Chunling","Warsame, Omar","Jenkins, Robert B","Roberts, Lewis R"],"doi":"10.1159\/000375461","endpage":"18","first_seen_on":"2015-08-04T11:45:33+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1664-5561"],"issue":"1","journal":"Medical epigenetics","last_mentioned_on":1438688711,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26236329?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26236329","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"1","title":"Restoration of epigenetically silenced SULF1 expression by 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine sensitizes hepatocellular carcinoma cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis.","type":"article","volume":"3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/epigen_papers\/status\/628532128163041281","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4360467],"posted_on":"2015-08-04T11:45:11+00:00","author":{"name":"epigenetics_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Epigenetics","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/471205704921931776\/wSQqKYz8_normal.jpeg","description":"Chromatin & epigenetics paper feed from #Pubmed and #Arxiv - hear it here first!
