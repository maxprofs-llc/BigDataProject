We report on a patient with a\u00a0mediastinal Aspergillus fumigatus infection resistant to posaconazole and describe how she was successfully managed with tacrolimus therapeutic drug-level monitoring.\nOur patient presented with a mediastial Aspergillus fumigatus infection, 2\u00a0years after lung transplantation. A.\u00a0fumigatus was resistant to posaconazole, and the patient had intolerance to voriconazole shown by elevated transaminases. The patient was given isavuconazole with drug-level monitoring. She was managed successfully with no adverse events. Tacrolimus concentration continued to increase after more than 2\u00a0weeks of therapy and required a further reduction to 72% of the usual dose to maintain the target concentrations over a 8-week period.\nWhen isavuconazole is given to patients on tacrolimus, the dose of the latter will need considerable reduction. We would suggest an initial 50% reduction and recommend close weekly monitoring of tacrolimus concentration. Further dose decreases of 25-50% may be required.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d06","authors":["Kim, T.","Jancel, T.","Kumar, P.","Freeman, A.
