We conducted a horizontal study of BV in Bahia, a state of Brazil in which the production of milk is increasing. During 2011, human and bovine clinical samples were collected during outbreaks for BV diagnosis, virus isolation and molecular analysis. We collected data for epidemiological inferences. Vaccinia virus was detected in 87.7\u00a0% of the analyzed outbreaks, highlighting the effective circulation of VACV in Bahia. The molecular data showed the spreading of group 1 Brazilian VACV to Bahia. We observed a seasonal profile of BV, with its peak in the drier and cooler season. Manual milking was observed in 96 % of the visited properties, showing its importance to viral spread in herds. Under-notification of BV, ineffective animal trade surveillance, and bad milking practices have contributed to the spread of VACV in Brazil.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000230f","authors":["Assis, Felipe L","Franco-Luiz, Ana Paula M","Paim, Luis M","Oliveira, Graziele P","Pereira, Alexandre F","de Almeida, Gabriel M F","Figueiredo, Leandra B","Tanus, Adriano","Trindade, Giliane S","Ferreira, Paulo P","Kroon, Erna G","Abrah\u00e3o, J\u00f4natas S"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00705-015-2549-1","first_seen_on":"2015-08-05T10:47:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-8798"],"journal":"Archives of Virology","last_mentioned_on":1438771615,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26239343?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26239343","pubdate":"2015-08-05T22:00:58+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Virology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Horizontal study of vaccinia virus infections in an endemic area: epidemiologic, phylogenetic and economic aspects.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/horizontal-study-vaccinia-virus-infections-endemic-area-epidemiologic-phylogenetic-economic-aspects"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5446280,"mean":6.3424578120231,"rank":4532343,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5446280,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189765,"mean":8.8640029194158,"rank":152045,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189765,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1009,"mean":1.9249047619048,"rank":694,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1009,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79,"mean":0.77115384615385,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
