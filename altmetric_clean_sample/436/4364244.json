Anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) are chosen as characteristic examples. Coarse-grained models of the surfactants are constructed and parameterized using a combination of atomistic molecular simulation and infinite dilution activity coefficient calibration. Electrostatic interactions of charged beads are treated using a smeared charge approximation: the surfactant heads and dissociated counterions are modeled as beads with charges distributed around the bead center and placed in implicit dielectric medium. The proposed models semi-quantitatively describe the self-assembly in solutions of SDS and CTAB at various surfactant concentration and molarity of added electrolyte. In particular, the model predicts a decline in the free surfactant concentration with the increase of the total surfactant loading, as well as characteristic aggregation transitions in single-component surfactant solutions caused by the addition of salt. The calculated values of the critical micelle concentration reasonably agree with experimental observations. Modeling of catanionic SDS-CTAB mixture shows consecutive transitions to worm-like micelles and then to vesicles caused by addition of CTAB to micellar solution of SDS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec5","authors":["Lee, Ming-Tsung","Mao, Runfang","Neimark, Alexander V","Vishnyakov, Aleksey"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jpcb.5b05630","first_seen_on":"2015-08-05T11:07:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-5207"],"journal":"Journal of Physical Chemistry B","last_mentioned_on":1439943972,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26241704?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jpcb.5b05630"],"pmid":"26241704","pubdate":"2015-08-05T22:00:10+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Modeling Aggregation of Ionic Surfactants Using a Smeared Charge Approximation in Dissipative Particle Dynamics Simulations","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/modeling-aggregation-ionic-surfactants-using-smeared-charge-approximation-dissipative-particle-dynam"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5558092,"mean":6.324208653655,"rank":2679309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2825499,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5558092,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192401,"mean":8.8259483679835,"rank":93159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":97271,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192401,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2949,"mean":1.7616031207598,"rank":651,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":2270,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2949,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":2.0353658536585,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
