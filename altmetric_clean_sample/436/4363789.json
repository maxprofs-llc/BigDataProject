The POLYGEN DEFI-ALPHA PHRC has recently (2013) been added to the project to identify modifiers genes by two complementary approaches: (i) the candidate genes strategy with the SERPINA1, CFTR (cystic fibrosis gene), MAN1B1 and SORL1 genes, these two latter being implied in the degradation of misfolding proteins; (ii) the whole exome sequencing (WES) strategy in families in which the PiZ proband has a PiZ brother or sister free of any hepatic sign.\nThe clinical parameter we want to explain is the apparition of a portal hypertension in PiZ children. In the DEFI-ALPHA project, three criteria will be tested: (i) age of inclusion in the cohort, (ii) the way of inclusion (neo-natal icterus or later hepatic impairment) and (iii) treatment or not with ursodesoxycholic acid and, if so, its duration. Genetically, polymorphisms on the SERPINA1 and MAN1B1 genes have already been associated in the literature with different clinical evolutions of the A1ATD but very inconstantly. Our study thus aims to confirm or not this association. The CFTR and SORL1 genes have never been studied in the \u03b11-AT deficiency. Finally, the whole exome sequencing strategy could allow the discovery of new unexpected modifiers genes in this disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6363cf058f610008808","authors":["Joly, P","Restier, L","Bouchecareilh, M","Lacan, P","Cabet, F","Chapuis-Cellier, C","Francina, A","Lachaux, A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.rmr.2015.06.010","first_seen_on":"2015-08-05T10:10:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1776-2588"],"journal":"Revue des Maladies Respiratoires (ScienceDirect)","last_mentioned_on":1438770544,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26238925?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26238925?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26238925","pubdate":"2015-08-05T22:01:08+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"[DEFI-ALPHA cohort and POLYGEN DEFI-ALPHA clinical research hospital programme.
