This is thought to arise from inhibition of receptor dimerization and the immune tagging of the cancer cells; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms have remained enigmatic. Previously, a molecular modeling study suggested that this resulted from colocalization of the two antibodies on to the extracellular domain of Her2. We report here the experimental characterization of this interaction by measuring the binding kinetics of these two whole antibodies and their F(ab)s to the extracellular domain of Her2 in solution. We found that both antibodies (the whole antibodies and the fragments) colocalized on to Her2, but did not augment the binding of each other.","altmetric_jid":"55f026672a83eea53d8b4567","authors":["Wai-Heng Lua","Wai-Heng Lua","Samuel Ken-En Gan","David Philip Lane","Chandra Shekhar Verma"],"doi":"10.1038\/npjbcancer.2015.12","first_seen_on":"2015-08-05T20:45:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2374-4677"],"journal":"npj Breast Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1439777287,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/npjbcancer201512","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/npjbcancer.2015.12"],"pmcid":"PMC5515203","pmid":"28721368","pubdate":"2015-08-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Breast cancer","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Pharmacology","scheme":"npg"}],"title":"A search for synergy in the binding kinetics of Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab whole and F(ab) to Her2","type":"article","volume":"1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/search-synergy-binding-kinetics-trastuzumab-pertuzumab-whole-fab-her2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5493125,"mean":6.3767617508741,"rank":3866062,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":922781,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5493125,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192313,"mean":8.8184834955698,"rank":132868,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":38136,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192313,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":25.754965517241,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":7.0333333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mdelahun\/status\/629030496488550400","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4366123],"posted_on":"2015-08-05T20:45:31+00:00","author":{"name":"Martin D.
