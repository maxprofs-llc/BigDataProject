Continuous and discontinuous state feedback controller are designed such that the neural networks model can realize exponential complete synchronization in view of functional differential inclusions theory, Lyapunov functional method and inequality technique. The new proposed results here are very easy to verify and also applicable to neural networks with continuous activations. Finally, some numerical examples show the applicability and effectiveness of our main results.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024db","authors":["Dongshu Wang","Dongshu Wang","Lihong Huang","Longkun Tang"],"doi":"10.1063\/1.4927737","first_seen_on":"2015-08-05T16:39:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1089-7682"],"issue":"8","journal":"Chaos","last_mentioned_on":1438784033,"links":["http:\/\/scitation.aip.org\/content\/aip\/journal\/chaos\/25\/8\/10.1063\/1.4927737?TRACK=RSS"],"pmid":"26328554","pubdate":"2015-08-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"AIP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Mathematics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Numerical And Computational Mathematics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Mathematics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"New results for global exponential synchronization in neural networks via functional differential inclusions","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-results-global-exponential-synchronization-neural-networks-via-functional-differential-inclusion"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5446629,"mean":6.3432151099742,"rank":4532593,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5446629,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189782,"mean":8.8636428304204,"rank":152053,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189782,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":727,"mean":4.0191487603306,"rank":336,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":727,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":4.0348823529412,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
