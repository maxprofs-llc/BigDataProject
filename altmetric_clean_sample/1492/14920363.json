However, the exact cell types and immunological factors that initiate the lung-specific immune responses are unclear. We found that upon intratracheal instillation, particulates such as aluminum salts and silica killed alveolar macrophages (AMs), which then released interleukin-1\u03b1 (IL-1\u03b1) and caused inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) formation in the lung. IL-1\u03b1 release continued for up to 2\u00a0weeks after particulate exposure, and type-2 allergic immune responses were induced by the inhalation of antigen during IL-1\u03b1 release and iBALT formation, even long after particulate instillation. Recombinant IL-1\u03b1 was sufficient to induce iBALTs, which coincided with subsequent immunoglobulin E responses, and IL-1-receptor-deficient mice failed to induce iBALT formation. Therefore, the AM-IL-1\u03b1-iBALT axis might be a therapeutic target for particulate-induced allergic inflammation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a95","authors":["Etsushi Kuroda","Koji Ozasa","Burcu Temizoz","Keiichi Ohata","Christine X.
