Based on sequence alignment, MCR-1 should be a phosphoethanolamine transferase, members of the YhjW\/YjdB\/YijP superfamily and catalyze the addition of phosphoethanolamine to lipid A, which needs to be validated experimentally. Here we report the first high-resolution crystal structure of the C-terminal catalytic domain of MCR-1 (MCR-1C) in its native state. The active pocket of native MCR-1C depicts unphosphorylated nucleophilic residue Thr285 in coordination with two Zinc ions and water molecules. A flexible adjacent active site loop (aa: Lys348-365) pose an open conformation compared to its structural homologues, suggesting of an open substrate entry channel. Taken together, this structure sets ground for further study of substrate binding and MCR-1 catalytic mechanism in development of potential therapeutic agents.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Guixing Ma","Yifan Zhu","Zhicheng Yu","Ashfaq Ahmad","Hongmin Zhang"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep39540","first_seen_on":"2016-12-22T00:40:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1484235291,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep39540","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5175174\/"],"pmcid":"PMC5175174","pmid":"28000749","pubdate":"2016-12-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Antimicrobial resistance","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"X-ray crystallography","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"39540","subjects":["science"],"title":"High resolution crystal structure of the catalytic domain of MCR-1","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/high-resolution-crystal-structure-catalytic-domain-mcr1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13,"score_history":{"1y":13,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8063599,"mean":6.8425680134317,"rank":617716,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7437744,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8063599,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257494,"mean":12.419228165426,"rank":32031,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":225335,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257494,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32709,"mean":14.962627247157,"rank":4990,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":27700,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32709,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3111,"mean":16.240559485531,"rank":525,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":2584,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3111,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
