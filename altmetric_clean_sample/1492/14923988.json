Further evidence that the disease is a zoonosis is given in this report of infection in a consumer of untreated milk. The organism was isolated from a sample of milk, and from two cows in a herd of 93 Jersey cattle. One of the farm workers was a symptomless nasal carrier.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c4","authors":["Bostock, A D","Gilbert, F R","Lewis, D","Smith, D C","A.D. Bostock","F.R. Gilbert","D.
