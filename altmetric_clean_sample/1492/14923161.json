Given the prominent role of PI3K\u03b1,\u03b2 in tumor growth and PI3K\u03b3,\u03b4 in immune cell function, we sought to determine whether PI3K inhibition altered anti-tumor immunity.\nThe effect of PI3K inhibition on tumor growth, metastasis, and anti-tumor immune response was characterized in mouse models utilizing orthotopic implants of 4T1 or PyMT mammary tumors into syngeneic or PI3K\u03b3 null mice, and patient-derived breast cancer xenografts in humanized mice. Tumor infiltrating leukocytes were characterized by IHC and FACS analysis in BKM120 (30mg\/kg, QD) or vehicle treated mice and PI3K\u03b3 null versus PI3K\u03b3 WT mice. Based on the finding that PI3K inhibition resulted in a more inflammatory tumor leukocyte infiltrate, the therapeutic efficacy of BKM120 (30mg\/kg, QD) and anti-PD1 (100\u03bcg, twice weekly) was evaluated in PyMT tumor bearing mice.\nOur findings show that PI3K activity facilitates tumor growth and surprisingly, restrains tumor immune surveillance. These activities could be partially suppressed by BKM120 or by host genetic deletion of PI3K\u03b3. The anti-tumor effect of PI3K\u03b3 loss in host, but not tumor, was partially reversed by CD8+T cell depletion. Treatment with therapeutic doses of both BKM120 and antibody to PD-1 resulted in consistent inhibition of tumor growth compared to either agent alone.\nPI3K inhibition slows tumor growth, enhances anti-tumor immunity, and heightens susceptibility to immune checkpoint inhibitors. We propose that combining PI3K inhibition with anti-PD1 may be a viable therapeutic approach for triple negative breast cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006efa","authors":["Jiqing Sai","Philip Owens","Sergey V.
