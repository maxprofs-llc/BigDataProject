Periodic limb movements (PLMs) in sleep are repetitive movements involving the great toe, ankle, and hip. Evolving evidence suggests that PLMs may be associated with high blood pressure and stroke, but this relationship remains underexplored. Several issues limit the study of PLMs including the need to manually score them, which is time-consuming and costly. For this reason, we developed a novel automated method for nocturnal PLM detection, which was shown to be correlated with (a) the manually scored PLM index on polysomnography, and (b) white matter hyperintensities on brain imaging, which have been demonstrated to be associated with PLMs. Our proposed algorithm consists of three main stages: (1) representing the signal in the time-frequency plane using time-frequency matrices (TFM), (2) applying K-nonnegative matrix factorization technique to decompose the TFM matrix into its significant components, and (3) applying kernel sparse representation for classification (KSRC) to the decomposed signal. Our approach was applied to a dataset that consisted of 65 subjects who underwent polysomnography. An overall classification of 97\u00a0% was achieved for discrimination of the aforementioned signals, demonstrating the potential of the presented method.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5023cf058f610003090","authors":["Shokrollahi, Mehrnaz","Krishnan, Sridhar","Dopsa, Dustin D","Muir, Ryan T","Black, Sandra E","Swartz, Richard H","Murray, Brian J","Boulos, Mark I"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11517-015-1444-y","first_seen_on":"2016-02-29T16:09:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1741-0444"],"issue":"11","journal":"Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing","last_mentioned_on":1456758187,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26872678"],"pmid":"26872678","pubdate":"2016-10-21T22:27:01+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Computer Applications","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Physiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Imaging \/ Radiology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Engineering","Physical Sciences","Computer Science"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering","medicalinformatics"],"title":"Nonnegative matrix factorization and sparse representation for the automated detection of periodic limb movements in sleep","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nonnegative-matrix-factorization-sparse-representation-automated-detection-periodic-limb-movements-s-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7313486,"mean":6.3735475029997,"rank":3736118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2057367,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7313486,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282524,"mean":10.639513674992,"rank":152625,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":100435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282524,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":273,"mean":2.8599338235294,"rank":108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":92,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":273,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":10.651666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
