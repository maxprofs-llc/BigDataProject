A 24h storage at 4\u00b0C resulted in a decrease in GLS content (20-40%, depending on the cooking time applied) in the edible parts. The most significant losses were observed for sinigrin (20-45%), and the least for glucobrassicin (12-32%). Storage had a diversified effect on GLS breakdown products (indole-3-acetonitrile, indole-3-carbinol, ascorbigen and 3,3'-diindolylmethane released from glucobrassicin and 4-methylsulfinylbutanenitrile released from glucoiberin) in the boiled cabbage. The increase in the content of indole-3-acetonitrile, especially considerable within the first 24h of storage (and a simultaneous decrease in glucobrassicin) clearly indicates that degradation of GLS may occur during storage or cooling to 4\u00b0C.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028f5","authors":["Ewa Ciska","Natalia Drabi\u0144ska","Agnieszka Narwojsz","Joanna Honke"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.foodchem.2016.02.079","endpage":"347","first_seen_on":"2016-02-29T16:32:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["03088146","0308-8146"],"journal":"Food Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1456759943,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0308814616302400"],"pmid":"26948623","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"340","subjects":["chemistry","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Stability of glucosinolates and glucosinolate degradation products during storage of boiled white cabbage ","type":"article","volume":"203","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/stability-glucosinolates-glucosinolate-degradation-products-during-storage-boiled-white-cabbage"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7313486,"mean":6.3735475029997,"rank":5524133,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":994099,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7313486,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282524,"mean":10.639517922434,"rank":198339,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":44447,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282524,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3010,"mean":3.6638983050847,"rank":1756,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":741,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3010,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159,"mean":2.3807721518987,"rank":76,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
