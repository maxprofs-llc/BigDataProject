In this study, we aimed to determine whether aberrant methylation of the ER\u03b2 promoter is associated with decreased ER\u03b2 gene expression in breast cancer.\nER\u03b2 methylation status was determined for 132 pairs of breast cancer and adjacent normal tissues via the MethyLight method. Additionally, mRNA relative expression was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to determine whether aberrant methylation had a negative correlation with expression. The correlation of ER\u03b2 promoter methylation and clinical parameters is also discussed.\nMethylation was observed in 96 (72.7%) breast cancer samples, and the median percentage of fully methylated reference (PMR) among methylated tissues was 0.83. Meanwhile, 94 (71.2%) adjacent normal tissues were methylated and the median PMR was 0.48. Compared to adjacent normal tissues, the methylation level of breast cancer was significantly higher (p < 0.001) and mRNA expression was much lower (p < 0.001). There was a significant correlation between ER\u03b2 methylation and mRNA expression in adjacent normal breast tissues (p = 0.004). In addition, the methylation rate of cancer tissues whose maximum diameter < 3 cm was significantly higher than those > 3 cm (p = 0.025).\nER\u03b2 promoter methylation level varies between cancerous and adjacent normal breast tissues. There was significant downregulation of ER\u03b2 methylation expression in pre-cancerous stages of breast cancer. Therefore, demethylation drugs may offer a potential strategy for preventing the development of pre-cancerous cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6793cf058f610009753","authors":["Gao, Lei","Qi, Xiaolong","Hu, Kaiwen","Zhu, Ruili","Xu, Wei","Sun, Shipeng","Zhang, Lixin","Yang, Ximing","Hua, Baojin","Liu, Guijian"],"doi":"10.5114\/aoms.2016.57588","first_seen_on":"2016-03-01T11:32:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1734-1922"],"issue":"1","journal":"Archives of Medical Science","last_mentioned_on":1456830427,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26925128?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26925128","pubdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Estrogen receptor \u03b2 promoter methylation: a potential indicator of malignant changes in breast cancer","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/estrogen-receptor-%CE%B2-promoter-methylation-potential-indicator-malignant-changes-breast-cancer-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7325869,"mean":6.3768565404091,"rank":5535490,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":994481,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7325869,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282583,"mean":10.65562950931,"rank":198339,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":44477,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282583,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":381,"mean":2.1824736842105,"rank":272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":72,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":381,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":0.9,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/704624001067319297","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6028979],"posted_on":"2016-03-01T11:07:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":713},"tweet_id":"704624001067319297"}]}}
