Hearing was defined by the speech frequency pure tone average (no impairment < 25 dB, mild impairment 25-40 dB, and moderate or greater impairment > 40 dB). Emotional vitality was defined as having a high sense of personal mastery, happiness, low depressive symptomatology, and low anxiety.\nCompared with individuals with no HI, participants with moderate or greater HI had a 23% lower odds of emotional vitality (odds ratio [OR] = 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.59-0.99). Hearing aid use was not associated with better emotional vitality (OR = 0.98; 95% CI: 0.81-1.20).\nHI is associated with lower odds of emotional vitality in older adults. Further studies are needed to examine the longitudinal impact of HI on mental health and well-being.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fac","authors":["Contrera, Kevin J","Betz, Josh","Deal, Jennifer A","Choi, Janet S","Ayonayon, Hilsa N","Harris, Tamara","Helzner, Elizabeth","Martin, Kathryn R","Mehta, Kala","Pratt, Sheila","Rubin, Susan M","Satterfield, Suzanne","Yaffe, Kristine","Garcia, Melissa","Simonsick, Eleanor M","Lin, Frank R",", "],"doi":"10.1093\/geronb\/gbw005","endpage":"404","first_seen_on":"2016-02-29T20:22:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1758-5368","1079-5014"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journals of Gerontology Series B: Psychological Sciences & Social Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1472602596,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26883806?utm_content=buffer356ce&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26883806?dopt=Abstract&utm_content=bufferfc244&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26883806?utm_content=researchreading&utm_medium=social&utm_term=research&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=UCSF%20Psychiatry","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26883806?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26883806","pubdate":"2016-05-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Sociology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"400","subjects":["socialsciences","geriatrics","psychology"],"title":"Association of Hearing Impairment and Emotional Vitality in Older Adults","type":"article","volume":"71","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-hearing-impairment-emotional-vitality-older-adults"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8307635,"mean":7.0030489970953,"rank":3814720,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4409789,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8307635,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":288952,"mean":10.981110575841,"rank":125747,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":158202,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":288952,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":862,"mean":10.886822299652,"rank":538,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":313,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":862,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":9.033,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
