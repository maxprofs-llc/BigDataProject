In these conditions the substrate 1 was enantioselectively dehalogenated yielding 4-((E)-4',8'-dimethylnona-3',7'-dien-1-yl)-4-methyl-5-methylenedihydrofuran-2-one (2), which structure was established based on the spectroscopic data. The most effective biocatalyst was Didymosphaeria igniaria, which catalyzed the process with highest rate and enantioselectivity (ee of product =76%). The antiproliferative activity of \u03b4-iodo-\u03b3-lactone 1, product of its biotransformation 2 and starting substrate - farnesol has been evaluated towards two cancer cell lines: A549 (human lung adenocarcinoma) and HL-60 (human promyelocytic leukaemia).
