The effects of sialidases on \u03b12,6 sialylation was assessed by flow cytometry using biotin conjugated Sambucus nigra lectin. Lectin affinity assays were used to determine expression of \u03b12,6 sialylated integrins. Cell migration and invasion were investigated by wound healing and transwell invasion assays.\n\u03b12, \u03b15 and \u03b21 integrins had considerable \u03b12,6 sialylation on MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas signals from MCF-7 cells were undetectable. Cleavage of \u03b12,6 sialylation increased adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells to ECM, while adhesion of MCF-7 cells was unaffected, consistent with the latter's lack of endogenous \u03b12,6 sialylated surface integrins. Neither surface expression of \u03b12\u03b21 and \u03b15\u03b21 integrins, nor activated \u03b21 integrin, changed in MDA-MB-231 cells after sialidase treatment. However, sialidase treatment did not have significant impact on migration or invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells.\nCell adhesion is an important early step of cancer metastasis, yet the roles of sialylation in regulating integrin-mediated breast cancer cell adhesion in comparison to migration and invasion are not well-understood. Our data suggest desialylation of \u03b12,6-sialylated integrins increases adhesion, but not migration or invasion, of MDA-MB-231 cells to ECM without altering integrin expression. It should be considered that \u03b12,6 sialylation may play different roles in regulating cell adhesion of different cancer cells when developing potential therapeutics targeting \u03b12,6 sialylation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4fb3cf058f610003014","authors":["Yuan, Ye","Wu, Larry","Shen, Siqi","Wu, Shiyong","Burdick, Monica M","Ye Yuan","Larry Wu","Siqi Shen","Shiyong Wu","Monica M.
