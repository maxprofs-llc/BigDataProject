The minus-end-directed motor dynein plays a pivotal role in centrosome separation, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive, particularly regarding how dynein coordinates this process in space and time. We addressed these questions in the one-cell C.\u00a0elegans embryo, using a combination of 3D time-lapse microscopy and computational modeling. Our analysis reveals that centrosome separation is powered by the joint action of dynein at the nuclear envelope and at the cell cortex. Strikingly, we demonstrate that dynein at the cell cortex acts as a force-transmitting device that harnesses polarized actomyosin cortical flows initiated by the centrosomes earlier in the cell cycle. This mechanism elegantly couples cell polarization with centrosome separation, thus ensuring faithful cell division.","altmetric_jid":"52d545303cf058dd068b4567","authors":["Alessandro De\u00a0Simone","Fran\u00e7ois N\u00e9d\u00e9lec","Pierre G\u00f6nczy","De Simone, Alessandro","N\u00e9d\u00e9lec, Fran\u00e7ois","G\u00f6nczy, Pierre"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.celrep.2016.01.077","first_seen_on":"2016-02-29T19:34:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2211-1247"],"journal":"Cell Reports","last_mentioned_on":1456831215,"links":["http:\/\/www.cell.com\/cell-reports\/fulltext\/S2211-1247(16)30093-6","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26923593?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S2211124716300936\/pdf","pmid":"26923593","pubdate":"2016-02-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"Dynein Transmits Polarized Actomyosin Cortical Flows to Promote Centrosome Separation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dynein-transmits-polarized-actomyosin-cortical-flows-promote-centrosome-separation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7325869,"mean":6.3768565404091,"rank":5535495,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":994459,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7325869,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282541,"mean":10.639599391236,"rank":198394,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":44397,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282541,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3424,"mean":21.465013730646,"rank":3214,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":132,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3424,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":294,"mean":27.318614334471,"rank":285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":294,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
