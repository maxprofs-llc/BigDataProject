Age-adjusted risk of accidental death, as well as cancers of the nervous and lymphatic\/hematopoietic systems, was significantly elevated in male and female pesticide-exposed workers; breast, prostate, and testicular cancer mortality risks were not elevated.\nCompared to all other workers, farmers and pesticide applicators were at greater risk of accidental mortality. These pesticide-exposed workers were not at an increased risk of cancers possibly associated with exposure to estrogen analogue compounds, but were at an increased risk of hematopoietic and nervous system cancers. NHIS mortality follow-up represents an important occupational health surveillance instrument.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f6100064dc","authors":["Fleming, Lora E","G\u00f3mez-Mar\u00edn, Orlando","Zheng, Diane","Ma, Fangchao","Lee, David","Fleming, Lora E.","G\u00f3mez\u2010Mar\u00edn, Orlando","Lora E.
