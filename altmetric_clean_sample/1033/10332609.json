Recently, we have demonstrated CFTR expression in the brain, the spinal cord and the sympathetic ganglia. This study aims to investigate the expression and distribution of CFTR in the ganglia of the human gastrointestinal tract. Fresh tissue and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded normal gastrointestinal tract samples were collected from eleven surgical patients and five autopsy cases. Immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, laser-assisted microdissection and nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction were performed. Expression of CFTR protein and mRNA was detected in neurons of the ganglia of all segments of the human gastrointestinal tract examined, including the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, appendix, colon and rectum. The extensive expression of CFTR in the enteric ganglia suggests that CFTR may play a role in the physiology of the innervation of the gastro-intestinal tract. The presence of dysfunctional CFTRs in enteric ganglia could, to a certain extent, explain the gastrointestinal symptoms frequently experienced by CF patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Xue, Ruiqi","Gu, Huan","Qiu, Yamei","Guo, Yong","Korteweg, Christine","Huang, Jin","Gu, Jiang"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep30926","first_seen_on":"2016-08-08T16:34:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1470674072,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27491544"],"pmid":"27491544","pubdate":"2016-08-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cell signalling","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Neurological disorders","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"30926","subjects":["science"],"title":"Expression of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator in Ganglia of Human Gastrointestinal Tract","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expression-cystic-fibrosis-transmembrane-conductance-regulator-ganglia-human-gastrointestinal-tract"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8183022,"mean":6.92160443679,"rank":6214411,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1101681,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8183022,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257528,"mean":11.99855167031,"rank":182809,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":40056,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257528,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34396,"mean":14.875309608955,"rank":25004,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":5483,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34396,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3325,"mean":16.61783032491,"rank":2398,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":526,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3325,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
