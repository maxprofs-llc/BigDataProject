This post hoc study analyzed data from a Phase III study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00433160) to determine if there was an association between serum PINP elevation and serum calcium concentration or calcium metabolism-related disorders.\nJapanese subjects with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture were randomized 2:1 to teriparatide 20 \u03bcg\/day (n=137) or placebo (n=70) for a 12-month double-blind treatment period, followed by 12 months of open-label teriparatide treatment of all subjects.\nSerum PINP levels were measured at baseline, and after 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of treatment. Serum calcium levels were measured at baseline, and after 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months of treatment.\nSerum PINP increased from baseline to 1 month of treatment and then remained high through 24 months. Twenty-eight of 195 subjects experienced PINP elevations >200 \u03bcg\/L during teriparatide treatment. Serum calcium concentration in both the teriparatide and placebo groups remained within the normal range. There was no clinically relevant difference in serum calcium concentration between subjects with PINP >200 \u03bcg\/L and subjects with PINP \u2264200 \u03bcg\/L. Two subjects experienced hypercalcemia and recovered without altering teriparatide treatment. Adverse events possibly related to calcium metabolism disorders included periarthritis calcarea (one subject) and chondrocalcinosis pyrophosphate (two subjects), but neither was accompanied with a significant increase in PINP or serum calcium concentration.\nAlthough the moderate size of this study prevented statistical analysis of any potential association between calcium metabolism-related disorders and elevated PINP, this analysis suggests that there was no association between serum PINP elevation during daily teriparatide treatment and serum calcium concentration or calcium metabolism-related disorders in Japanese subjects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f02","authors":["Takanori Yamamoto","Mika Tsujimoto","Hideaki Sowa"],"doi":"10.2147\/cia.s83549","first_seen_on":"2015-07-07T03:35:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1178-1998"],"journal":"Clinical Interventions in Aging","last_mentioned_on":1436243809,"links":["http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/safety-of-daily-teriparatide-treatment-a-post-hoc-analysis-of-a-phase--peer-reviewed-article-CIA"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=25813","pmid":"26185429","pubdate":"2015-07-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Safety of daily teriparatide treatment: a post hoc analysis of a Phase III study to investigate the possible association of teriparatide treatment with calcium homeostasis in patients with serum procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide elevation","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/safety-daily-teriparatide-treatment-post-hoc-analysis-phase-iii-study-investigate-possible-associati"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5325510,"mean":6.2413581056763,"rank":3528165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1576189,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5325510,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185954,"mean":8.4814062800817,"rank":120569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":56522,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185954,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":776,"mean":3.875455483871,"rank":483,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":776,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":3.2739692307692,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
