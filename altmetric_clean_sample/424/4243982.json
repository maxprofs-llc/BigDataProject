These compounds are hydrolyzed by all four Ambler classes of \u03b2-lactamases. Kinetic parameters were determined with 8 different \u03b2-lactamases, including VIM-2, NDM-1, KPC-2, and SPM-1. The compounds do not inhibit the growth of clinically important antibiotic resistant Gram negative bacteria in vitro. These chromogenic compounds have a distinct absorbance spectrum and turn purple when hydrolyzed by \u03b2-lactamases. One of these compounds, UW154, is easier to synthesize from commercial starting materials than nitrocefin and should be significantly less expensive to produce.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224b","authors":["Ghavami, Ahmad","Labb\u00e9, Genevi\u00e8ve","Brem, J\u00fcrgen","Goodfellow, Valerie J","Marrone, Laura","Tanner, Carol A","King, Dustin T","Lam, Melinda","Strynadka, Natalie C J","Pillai, Dylan R","Siemann, Stefan","Spencer, James","Schofield, Christopher J","Dmitrienko, Gary I"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ab.2015.06.032","first_seen_on":"2015-07-05T10:01:32+00:00","funders":["niehs","mrc","cihr"],"issns":["1096-0309","00032697"],"journal":"Analytical Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1436865901,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26142222?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26142222?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0003269715003255"],"pmid":"26142222","pubdate":"2015-07-05T22:00:31+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Assay for drug discovery: Synthesis and testing of nitrocefin analogues for use as \u03b2-lactamase substrates ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/assay-drug-discovery-synthesis-testing-nitrocefin-analogues-%CE%B2lactamase-substrates"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5352377,"mean":6.2635557475804,"rank":2382881,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":2910086,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5352377,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187279,"mean":8.4588008094919,"rank":80803,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":103022,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187279,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":803,"mean":2.3569077306733,"rank":379,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":419,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":803,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.7133333333333,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
