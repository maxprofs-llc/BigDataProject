Each approach is associated with specific benefits and drawbacks. We report outcomes of those 2 different strategies.\nBetween 2002 and 2012, 86 neonates with ductal-dependent PAVSD underwent surgery using primary repair (BVR group: n\u00a0= 28, 33%) or shunt palliation (BTS group: n\u00a0= 58, 67%). Early and late results were compared between the 2 groups.\nMedian age was 6 days (interquartile range [IQR] 3-17) and median weight was 2.8 kg (IQR 2.5-3.3) with 27 patients (31%) 2.5 kg or less. Associated risk factors such as prematurity 36 weeks or less and genetic or extra-cardiac malformations were present in 30% and 40% of patients, respectively. Hospital mortality occurred in 5 (5.8%) patients (1 [3.6%] for BVR versus 4 [6.9%] for BTS, p\u00a0= 1.00). Overall 8-year survival was 76.5% (85.5% for BVR versus 72.2% for BTS, p\u00a0= 0.189). On multivariable analysis, risk factors for mortality were genetic or extra-cardiac malformations (hazard ratio [HR], 2.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7% to 16.0%), p\u00a0= 0.036) and postoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (HR, 4.0 [95% CI, 1.1% to 14.4), p\u00a0= 0.039). Freedom from right ventricular outflow tract reoperation after achievement of repair was 63.2% at 8 years (52.4% for BVR versus 70.2% for BTS, p\u00a0= 0.170). On multivariable analysis, risk factors for reoperation were the use of conduit (HR, 8.7 [95% CI, 1.1% to 65.8%], p\u00a0= 0.037) and prematurity (HR, 2.8 [95% CI, 1.1% to 7.2%], p\u00a0= 0.028).\nPrimary BVR of neonates with ductal-dependent PAVSD is associated with a trend for improved survival due to hospital and interstage mortality with the staged approach. Genetic or extra-cardiac malformations are common and are associated with worse survival.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a35","authors":["Alsoufi, Bahaaldin","Mori, Makoto","McCracken, Courtney","Williams, Emily","Samai, Cyrus","Kogon, Brian","Ferguson, Eric","Kanter, Kirk"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.athoracsur.2015.05.017","first_seen_on":"2015-07-04T10:17:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1552-6259"],"journal":"The Annals of Thoracic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1446312493,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26138768?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26138768?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26138768","pubdate":"2015-07-04T22:03:20+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Results of Primary Repair Versus Shunt Palliation in Ductal Dependent Infants With Pulmonary Atresia and Ventricular Septal Defect.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/results-primary-repair-versus-shunt-palliation-ductal-dependent-infants-pulmonary-atresia-ventricula"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6510470,"mean":6.0313826788807,"rank":4575896,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1695712,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6510470,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196937,"mean":8.5346758642403,"rank":128449,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":59114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196937,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2718,"mean":2.960977548767,"rank":1158,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":1435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2718,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":136,"mean":2.9377777777778,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":70,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":136,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
