Hence, there is a great deal of interest in developing molecules that can bind and inhibit amyloid formation. In this regard, we have investigated the effect of two positively charged polysaccharides, chitosan (CHT) and its quarternary derivative N-trimethyl chitosan (TMC), on the aggregation of A\u03b240 peptide. Our aggregation kinetics and atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies show that both CHT and TMC exhibit a concentration-dependent inhibiting activity on A\u03b240 fibrillogenesis. Systematic pH-dependent studies demonstrate that the attractive electrostatic interactions between the positively charged moieties in CHT\/TMC and the negatively charged residues in A\u03b240 play a key role in this inhibiting activity. The stronger inhibiting activity of TMC than CHT further suggests the importance of electronic density of the polymer chain in interacting with A\u03b240 and blocking the fibril formation. The possible interactions between CHT\/TMC and A\u03b240 are also revealed at the atomic level by molecular docking simulation, showing that the A\u03b240 monomer could be primarily stabilized by electrostatic interactions with charged amines of CHT and quaternary amines of TMC, respectively. Binding of CHT\/TMC on the central hydrophobic core region of A\u03b240 peptide may be responsible for blocking the propagation of the nucleus to form fibrillar structures. These results suggest that incorporation of sugar units such as D-glucosamine and N-trimethyl-D-glucosamine into polymer structural template may serve as a new strategy for designing novel anti-amyloid molecules.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023e5","authors":["Liu, Haiyang","Ojha, Bimlesh","Morris, Clifford","Jiang, Mengting","Wojcikiewicz, Ewa P","Nekkar Rao, Praveen P","Du, Deguo"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.biomac.5b00603","first_seen_on":"2015-07-03T20:12:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1526-4602"],"journal":"Biomacromolecules","last_mentioned_on":1435881600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26125953"],"pmid":"26125953","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Positively Charged Chitosan and N-Trimethyl Chitosan Inhibit A\u03b240 Fibrillogenesis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/positively-charged-chitosan-ntrimethyl-chitosan-inhibit-a%CE%B240-fibrillogenesis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5307583,"mean":6.227983761721,"rank":761563,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":4501314,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5307583,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187612,"mean":8.4040118436553,"rank":35752,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":150409,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187612,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":763,"mean":4.6615039370079,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":668,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":763,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":4.0468333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
