The main experimental parameters affecting the FU step have been optimized by applying a PERMANOVA and PCO analysis allowing us to obtain a maximum amount of information with a minimum number of assays. The limits of detection for POPs fell within the 0.9-6.8\u00a0ng\/g d.w. interval; a linear method was used with correlation coefficients (r) higher than 0.99. Recovery percentages at low concentrations (25\u00a0ng\/g d.w.) were 75.8\u00a0%-110\u00a0%, and at high concentrations (75\u00a0ng\/g d.w.) 82.3\u00a0%-109\u00a0%; the evaluated precision as RSD% of repeatability and reproducibility were within a range of 0.5\u00a0%-11\u00a0% and 0.3\u00a0%-18\u00a0%, respectively.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f61000649f","authors":["R.
