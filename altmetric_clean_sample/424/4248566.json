These catalytic processes make use of the enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity of NPs and fulfill the requirements of green chemistry. Anchoring catalytically active metal NPs within a microfluidic reactor enhances the reagent\/catalyst interaction, while avoiding diffusion limitations experienced in classical approaches. Different strategies for supporting NPs are reviewed herein, namely, packed-bed reactors, monolithic flow-through reactors, wall catalysts, and a selection of novel approaches (NPs embedded on nanotubes, nanowires, catalytic membranes, and magnetic NPs). Through a number of catalytic reactions, such as hydrogenations, oxidations, and cross-coupling reactions, the advantages and possible drawbacks of each approach are illustrated.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e64","authors":["Ricciardi, Roberto","Huskens, Jurriaan","Verboom, Willem"],"doi":"10.1002\/cssc.201500514","endpage":"2605","first_seen_on":"2015-07-06T21:39:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1864-564X"],"issue":"16","journal":"ChemSusChem","last_mentioned_on":1436790644,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cssc.201500514\/abstract;jsessionid=4241A861303B3DC409EE6A7F92178CCF.f02t03","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cssc.201500514\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cssc.201500514\/pdf","pmid":"26150254","pubdate":"2015-07-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Energy","Materials Science","Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"2586","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Nanocatalysis in Flow","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nanocatalysis-flow"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6401454,"mean":5.9840565143566,"rank":2767905,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":3579988,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6401454,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189181,"mean":8.5197359234592,"rank":91987,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":95413,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189181,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":833,"mean":3.0951225961538,"rank":260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":529,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":833,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":2.575619047619,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
