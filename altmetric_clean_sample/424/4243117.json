In this study, 151 psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents, ages 13-17 with comorbid psychiatric and substance use disorders, were randomized to a two-session Motivational Interviewing intervention to reduce substance use plus treatment as usual (MI) vs. treatment as usual only (TAU). Results indicated that the MI group had a longer latency to first use of any substance following hospital discharge relative to TAU (36days versus 11days). Adolescents who received MI also reported less total use of substances and less use of marijuana during the first 6months post-discharge, although this effect was not significant across 12months. Finally, MI was associated with a significant reduction in rule-breaking behaviors at 6-month follow-up. Future directions are discussed, including means of extending effects beyond 6months and dissemination of the intervention to community-based settings.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f45","authors":["Brown, Richard A","Abrantes, Ana M","Minami, Haruka","Prince, Mark A","Bloom, Erika Litvin","Apodaca, Timothy R","Strong, David R","Picotte, Dawn M","Monti, Peter M","MacPherson, Laura","Matsko, Stephen V","Hunt, Jeffrey I"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jsat.2015.06.016","first_seen_on":"2015-07-04T17:40:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["07405472","1873-6483"],"journal":"Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1445740525,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0740547215001646?_docanchor=&_fmt=high&_origin=gateway&_rdoc=1&md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0740547215001646&_version=1&md5=7dc699db6f21dab17241e06a99466eee"],"pmid":"26362000","pubdate":"2015-09-13T22:00:42+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"Motivational Interviewing to Reduce Substance Use in Adolescents with Psychiatric Comorbidity.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/motivational-interviewing-reduce-substance-adolescents-psychiatric-comorbidity-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6447265,"mean":5.9812925678238,"rank":2373810,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":3978009,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6447265,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196502,"mean":8.4478853644511,"rank":77966,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":114495,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196502,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":720,"mean":4.7391766342142,"rank":259,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":448,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":720,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":2.5946956521739,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
