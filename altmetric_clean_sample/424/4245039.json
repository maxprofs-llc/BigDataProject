However, a dramatic fall was found in the rate for women, and a modest decline in that for men. Reduced exposure to carbon monoxide and to barbiturates coincided with the fall in rates.\nReduced exposure to lethal methods was responsible for the fall in rate in both genders, while the gender difference in favour of women may be related to their preference for non-violent methods or to their being less affected by the social changes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100057a0","authors":["KURT SCHAPIRA","K.
