Although most KM methods use a single kernel function to assess the marginal effect of a variable set, KM analyses involving multiple kernels have become increasingly popular. Multikernel analysis allows researchers to study more complex problems, such as assessing gene-gene or gene-environment interactions, incorporating variance-component based methods for population substructure into rare-variant association testing, and assessing the conditional effects of a variable set adjusting for other variable sets. The KM framework is robust, powerful, and provides efficient dimension reduction for multifactor analyses, but requires the estimation of high dimensional nuisance parameters. Traditional estimation techniques, including regularization and the \"expectation-maximization (EM)\" algorithm, have a large computational cost and are not scalable to large sample sizes needed for rare variant analysis. Therefore, under the context of gene-environment interaction, we propose a computationally efficient and statistically rigorous \"fastKM\" algorithm for multikernel analysis that is based on a low-rank approximation to the nuisance effect kernel matrices. Our algorithm is applicable to various trait types (e.g., continuous, binary, and survival traits) and can be implemented using any existing single-kernel analysis software. Through extensive simulation studies, we show that our algorithm has similar performance to an EM-based KM approach for quantitative traits while running much faster. We also apply our method to the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention (VISP) clinical trial, examining gene-by-vitamin effects on recurrent stroke risk and gene-by-age effects on change in homocysteine level.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f61000751e","authors":["Marceau, Rachel","Lu, Wenbin","Holloway, Shannon","Sale, Mich\u00e8le M","Worrall, Bradford B","Williams, Stephen R","Hsu, Fang-Chi","Tzeng, Jung-Ying"],"doi":"10.1002\/gepi.21909","endpage":"468","first_seen_on":"2015-07-04T11:54:37+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci","nigms"],"issns":["1098-2272"],"issue":"6","journal":"Genetic Epidemiology","last_mentioned_on":1457751847,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26139508?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26139508","pubdate":"2015-07-04T22:01:50+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"456","subjects":["epidemiology","geneticsmedical"],"title":"A Fast Multiple-Kernel Method With Applications to Detect Gene-Environment Interaction.","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fast-multiplekernel-method-applications-detect-geneenvironment-interaction"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7382271,"mean":6.4142077767366,"rank":3055822,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4219908,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7382271,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":225166,"mean":7.9980911331692,"rank":85507,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":135164,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":225166,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":460,"mean":2.7466361655773,"rank":189,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":261,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":460,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":2.3375,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
