Although IFNs restrict different steps of HIV replication cycle, their dominant antiviral effect remains unclear. We first quantified the inhibition of HIV replication by IFN in tissue culture, using viruses with different tropism and growth kinetics. By combining experimental and mathematical analyses, we determined quantitative estimates for key parameters of HIV replication and inhibition, and demonstrate that IFN mainly inhibits de novo infection (33% and 47% for a X4- and a R5-strain, respectively), rather than virus production (15% and 6% for the X4 and R5 strains, respectively). This finding is in agreement with patient-derived data analyses.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Hiroki Ikeda","Hiroki Ikeda","Ana Godinho-Santos","Sylvie Rato","B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Vanwalscappel","Fran\u00e7ois Clavel","Kazuyuki Aihara","Shingo Iwami","Fabrizio Mammano"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep11761","first_seen_on":"2015-07-06T09:34:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1436175220,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/srep\/2015\/150629\/srep11761\/full\/srep11761.html"],"pmid":"26119462","pubdate":"2015-06-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Population dynamics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Applied mathematics","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Quantifying the Antiviral Effect of IFN on HIV-1 Replication in Cell Culture","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quantifying-antiviral-effect-ifn-hiv1-replication-cell-culture"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5321078,"mean":6.2373493775806,"rank":2825182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1806172,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5321078,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186585,"mean":8.4702607619089,"rank":102790,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":65578,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186585,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18289,"mean":13.526091972878,"rank":10614,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":5854,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18289,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1694,"mean":11.014776137035,"rank":965,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":536,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1694,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
