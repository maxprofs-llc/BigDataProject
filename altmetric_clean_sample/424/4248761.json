A multivariate logistic regression model was used to investigate whether factors such as gender, year of registration, place of work, and subspecialty board certification were associated with maintaining board certification.\nMost Japanese surgeons attain board certification within 5-10\u00a0years of initial medical registration. After adjusting for possible confounding factors, the odds of maintaining board certification were significantly lower for women, those who were beyond 20\u00a0years post-registration, those who worked in hospitals other than academic hospitals or clinics, and those who had board certification in surgery only. Of the total board-certified surgeons analyzed, 93.2\u00a0% continued to work in hospitals and 2.8\u00a0% moved to clinics within 2\u00a0years. Of those who moved from hospitals to clinics, half continued to practice surgery, while nearly 40\u00a0% changed their specialty to internal medicine.\nIt is necessary to establish a special training system for mature surgeons who move from surgery to general practice later in their careers. As the number of female surgeon increases, a support system is also required to secure the future supply of surgeons.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037d2","authors":["Soichi Koike","Atsushi Shimizu","Masatoshi Matsumoto","Hiroo Ide","Hidenao Atarashi","Hideo Yasunaga"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00595-015-1212-5","first_seen_on":"2015-07-06T23:21:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1436-2813"],"journal":"Surgery Today","last_mentioned_on":1436224811,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00595-015-1212-5"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00595-015-1212-5.pdf","pmid":"26144272","pubdate":"2015-07-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Japan","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgical Oncology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Career pathways of board-certified surgeons in Japan","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/career-pathways-boardcertified-surgeons-japan"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5320710,"mean":6.2375557539431,"rank":4430162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5320710,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186571,"mean":8.4708945382431,"rank":150383,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186571,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":477,"mean":1.2781932773109,"rank":226,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":477,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":0.58095238095238,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SurgeryScience\/status\/618197782629756928","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4248761],"posted_on":"2015-07-06T23:20:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Surgical Research","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/552556384688939009\/rWmyj-8R_normal.jpeg","description":"Latest surgical research journal papers as they're published | Academic updates and CME | @DrEdFitzgerald","id_on_source":"SurgeryScience","tweeter_id":"2707749445","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2180},"tweet_id":"618197782629756928"}]}}
