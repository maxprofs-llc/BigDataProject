Indeed, some concern exists that such prophylaxis may increase the risk of infection with drug-resistant fungal organisms. Here, we describe a case of disseminated Scedosporium prolificans infection, presenting as pericarditis, which developed in a lung transplant patient receiving prophylactic voriconazole for 8\u00a0months. The epidemiology and clinical presentation of S.\u00a0prolificans infections are reviewed, and controversies surrounding antifungal prophylaxis and the development of resistant infections are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003692","authors":["Sayah, D.M.","Schwartz, B.S.","Kukreja, J.","Singer, J.P.","Golden, J.A.","Leard, L.E.","Sayah DM","Schwartz BS","Kukreja J","Singer JP","Golden JA","Leard LE"],"doi":"10.1111\/tid.12056","endpage":"E74","first_seen_on":"2014-01-16T23:55:48+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1399-3062","1398-2273"],"issue":"2","journal":"Transplant Infectious Disease","last_mentioned_on":1389916543,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/tid.12056\/abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/tid.12056"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/tid.12056\/pdf","pmid":"23387799","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"E70","title":"Scedosporium prolificans pericarditis and mycotic aortic aneurysm in a lung transplant recipient receiving voriconazole prophylaxis","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/scedosporium-prolificans-pericarditis-mycotic-aortic-aneurysm-lung-transplant-recipient-receiving-vo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6417151,"mean":5.9876941826198,"rank":1350509,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":5042470,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6417151,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":153636,"mean":7.7866662674523,"rank":38204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":114781,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":153636,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246,"mean":1.5213632653061,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":236,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.7642857142857,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":5},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":9,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1},"mendeley":{"CA":1,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Scedosporium prolificans","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=582470652#altmetric_citation_7","license":"public","citation_ids":[2049518],"posted_on":"2013-11-20T03:08:32+00:00","summary":"Scedosporium prolificans is an emerging opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes a wide variety of infections in immunocompetent and immunosuppressed people and animals.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=20495440","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Medmyco","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Medmyco"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/margitangyal\/status\/423966829111816192","license":"public","citation_ids":[2049518],"posted_on":"2014-01-16T23:55:43+00:00","author":{"name":"Margaret Angel","url":"http:\/\/elementaluncertainty.blogspot.ca","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/855643231551234048\/5VprcWi9_normal.jpg","description":"hematology-hemotherapy specialist\/ learning-addict\/ humanist-feminist\/ vegan lover of creatures great & small\/ spare-time yoga-poser, land-runner, & sea-diver","id_on_source":"margitangyal","tweeter_id":"154394236","geo":{"lt":43.70011,"ln":-79.4163,"country":"CA"},"followers":397},"tweet_id":"423966829111816192"}]}}
