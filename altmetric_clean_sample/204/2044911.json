Together, these contributions give an overview of current research and controversies in a vibrant branch of neuroscience with important implications for the understanding of many forms of learning and memory, and a wide spectrum of neurological and cognitive disorders.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032f2","authors":["T.
