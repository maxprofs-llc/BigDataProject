Exome seq uncovers integrin 8 alpha (ITGA8) mutations in renal agenesis.","ITGA8; Probable DD gene; 13729; Renal hypodysplasia\/aplasia 1; Biallelic; Loss of function;"],"citation":{"abstract":"Renal hypodysplasia (RHD) is a heterogeneous condition encompassing a spectrum of kidney development defects including renal agenesis, hypoplasia, and (cystic) dysplasia. Heterozygous mutations of several genes have been identified as genetic causes of RHD with various severity. However, these genes and mutations are not associated with bilateral renal agenesis, except for RET mutations, which could be involved in a few cases. The pathophysiological mechanisms leading to total absence of kidney development thus remain largely elusive. By using a whole-exome sequencing approach in families with several fetuses with bilateral renal agenesis, we identified recessive mutations in the integrin \u03b18-encoding gene ITGA8 in two families. Itga8 homozygous knockout in mice is known to result in absence of kidney development. We provide evidence of a damaging effect of the human ITGA8 mutations. These results demonstrate that mutations of ITGA8 are a genetic cause of bilateral renal agenesis and that, at least in some cases, bilateral renal agenesis is an autosomal-recessive disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021ff","authors":["Camille Humbert","Flora Silbermann","Bharti Morar","M\u00e9lanie Parisot","Mohammed Zarhrate","C\u00e9cile Masson","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Tores","Patricia Blanchet","Marie-Jos\u00e9 Perez","Yuliya Petrov","Philippe Khau\u00a0Van\u00a0Kien","Joelle Roume","Brigitte Leroy","Olivier Gribouval","Luba Kalaydjieva","Laurence Heidet","R\u00e9mi Salomon","Corinne Antignac","Alexandre Benmerah","Sophie Saunier","C\u00e9cile Jeanpierre"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ajhg.2013.12.017","first_seen_on":"2014-01-16T17:14:50+00:00","issns":["0002-9297","00029297"],"journal":"American Journal of Human Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1506552329,"links":["http:\/\/www.cell.com\/AJHG\/abstract\/S0002-9297(13)00614-9","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24439109","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24439109"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/download.cell.com\/AJHG\/pdf\/PIIS0002929713006149.pdf","pmid":"24439109","pubdate":"2014-01-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Integrin Alpha 8 Recessive Mutations Are Responsible for Bilateral Renal Agenesis in Humans.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/integrin-alpha-8-recessive-mutations-responsible-bilateral-renal-agenesis-humans"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":3,"1m":3,"1w":3,"6d":3,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462170,"mean":7.1084920520889,"rank":1412806,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":6971726,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462170,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189083,"mean":7.4992253519639,"rank":33232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":155556,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189083,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3567,"mean":11.928342120022,"rank":1016,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":2527,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3567,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":25.629761904762,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
