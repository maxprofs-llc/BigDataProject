This study compared quadriceps muscle force steadiness (MFS) in individuals with knee OA before and after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) to an age-matched group of controls. Lower extremity MFS was measured in 13 subjects with knee OA before and at six months after TKA (TKA-GROUP) and compared to an age-matched control group (CONTROL-GROUP). MFS was significantly more impaired in the TKA-GROUP at the pre-operative, but not post-operative visit, and significantly improved between the pre-operative and post-operative visits. Further research is warranted to evaluate the relation between this MFS measurement and physical functional performance in those at high risk for falling.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6203cf058f610007b79","authors":["Smith JW","Marcus RL","Peters CL","Pelt CE","Tracy BL","Lastayo PC"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.arth.2013.11.023","first_seen_on":"2014-01-13T17:34:33+00:00","issns":["0883-5403"],"issue":"","journal":"The Journal of Arthroplasty","last_mentioned_on":1389634467,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24405624"],"pmid":"24405624","pubdate":"2014-01-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Muscle Force Steadiness in Older Adults Before and After Total Knee Arthroplasty.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/muscle-force-steadiness-older-adults-before-after-total-knee-arthroplasty-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3063671,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":943544,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124009,"mean":7.6635458357528,"rank":81185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":27689,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124009,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":602,"mean":1.7842762063228,"rank":404,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":106,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":602,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":1.5411764705882,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Neuroscience":1,"Sports and Recreations":1,"Unspecified":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1},"mendeley":{"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CHLibrary1\/status\/422783716650262529","license":"public","citation_ids":[2040178],"posted_on":"2014-01-13T17:34:27+00:00","author":{"name":"CH Library","url":"http:\/\/libguides.lib.umanitoba.ca\/concordia","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3543993669\/89cb92d7ac990aa83388dcb381497dda_normal.jpeg","description":"Concordia Hospital Library supports the initiatives and patient-care activities of the Concordia Hospital.
