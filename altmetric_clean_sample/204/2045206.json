One aim of this review is to discuss the physiologic peculiarities that explain the increased vulnerability of infants and children to any pathology affecting the respiratory tract. The other aim is to highlight the importance of history taking and correct physical examination for early recognition of an impending catastrophic progression of respiratory failure. Under most circumstances, correct physical examination alone allows one to pinpoint the cause to a particular part of the respiratory system and to make the appropriate decisions for a proactive and life-saving management of the critically ill child.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008434","authors":["Hammer J"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.prrv.2013.02.001","first_seen_on":"2014-01-15T15:07:00+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Paediatric Respiratory Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1389860446,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23601209?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23601209","pubdate":"2013-04-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Acute respiratory failure in children.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/acute-respiratory-failure-children"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505692,"mean":5.1008244577038,"rank":2304623,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":2168290,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505692,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":129521,"mean":7.5177784898087,"rank":61583,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":66401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":129521,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":202,"mean":1.7076019900498,"rank":70,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":202,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":2.4142857142857,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":3,"Student  > Master":4,"Other":3,"Student  > Bachelor":7,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":23,"Nursing and Health Professions":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":1},"mendeley":{"US":2,"BR":2,"ZA":1,"AU":1,"PT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ACNPed\/status\/423470644982857728","license":"public","citation_ids":[2045206],"posted_on":"2014-01-15T15:04:04+00:00","author":{"name":"ACNP","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1687251577\/logo_normal.png","description":"Asociaci\u00f3n Colombiana de Neumolog\u00eda Pedi\u00e1trica","id_on_source":"ACNPed","tweeter_id":"434250807","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":157},"tweet_id":"423470644982857728"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ACNPed\/status\/423473197376233473","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2045206],"posted_on":"2014-01-15T15:14:12+00:00","author":{"name":"ACNP","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1687251577\/logo_normal.png","description":"Asociaci\u00f3n Colombiana de Neumolog\u00eda Pedi\u00e1trica","id_on_source":"ACNPed","tweeter_id":"434250807","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":157},"tweet_id":"423473197376233473"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Da5eel\/status\/423731541018034176","license":"datasift","rt":["ACNPed"],"citation_ids":[2045206],"posted_on":"2014-01-16T08:20:46+00:00","author":{"name":"Fahad Aldakheel","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/750219770360795136\/Xn5bdd-i_normal.jpg","description":"Don't judge me before you even know me.","id_on_source":"Da5eel","tweeter_id":"275504280","geo":{"lt":-37.83333,"ln":144.96667,"country":"AU"},"followers":179},"tweet_id":"423731541018034176"}]}}
