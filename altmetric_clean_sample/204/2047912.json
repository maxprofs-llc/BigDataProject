Chiral monophosphorus ligands L1-3 are effective for the syntheses of a series of functionalized chiral biaryls by asymmetric Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reactions in excellent yields and enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). The presence of a polar-\u03c0 interaction between the highly polarized BOP group and the extended \u03c0 system of arylboronic acid coupling partner is believed to be important for the high enantioselectivity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Guangqing Xu"],"doi":"10.1021\/ja409669r","first_seen_on":"2014-01-16T11:49:18+00:00","issns":["0002-7863"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1389858000,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ja409669r"],"pmid":"24147559","pubdate":"2013-10-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Efficient Syntheses of Korupensamines A, B and Michellamine B by Asymmetric Suzuki-Miyaura Coupling Reactions","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/efficient-syntheses-korupensamines-b-michellamine-b-asymmetric-suzukimiyaura-coupling-reactions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.624,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.624},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629660,"mean":4.9331369641107,"rank":528160,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":3101079,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629660,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108652,"mean":7.207806223597,"rank":18110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":90521,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108652,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12982,"mean":4.1015340882829,"rank":2563,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":10371,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12982,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":490,"mean":4.902200408998,"rank":107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":490,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
