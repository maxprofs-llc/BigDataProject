Specifically, we find that alkane ligands on faceted CdS nanorods in n-hexane undergo a temperature-dependent order-disorder transition akin to that of self-assembled monolayers on macroscopic substrates. This collective ligand alignment organizes nearby solvent molecules, strongly influencing the statistics of rod-rod separation. The strong temperature dependence of this mechanism could be exploited in the laboratory to manipulate and optimize the assembly of ordered structures.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003145","authors":["Asaph Widmer-Cooper"],"doi":"10.1021\/nl403067p","first_seen_on":"2014-01-14T22:01:43+00:00","issns":["1530-6984"],"journal":"Nano Letters","last_mentioned_on":1389736880,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/nl403067p"],"pmid":"24295449","pubdate":"2013-12-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Orientational Ordering of Passivating Ligands on CdS Nanorods in Solution Generates Strong Rod\u2013Rod Interactions","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/orientational-ordering-passivating-ligands-cds-nanorods-solution-generates-strong-rodrod-interaction"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":3108696,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":979499,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124190,"mean":7.6387575228082,"rank":83206,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":28779,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124190,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2905,"mean":9.9814462809917,"rank":2191,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":489,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2905,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":136,"mean":13.206237037037,"rank":108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":136,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
