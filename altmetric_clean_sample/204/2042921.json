This study assessed whether Team Epi-Aid participation by full-time graduate students impacted post-graduation employment, particularly by influencing students to work in governmental public health upon graduation. In September 2010, 223 program alumni were contacted for an online survey and 10 selected for follow-up interviews. Eighty-three Team Epi-Aid alumni answered the survey (response rate\u00a0=\u00a037\u00a0%). Forty-one (49\u00a0%) reported participating in at least one activity, with 12\/41 (29\u00a0%) indicating participation in Team Epi-Aid influenced their job choice following graduation. In 6\u00a0months prior to enrolling at UNC, 30 (36\u00a0%) reported employment in public health, with 16\/30 (53\u00a0%) employed in governmental public health. In 6\u00a0months following graduation, 34 (41\u00a0%) reported employment in public health, with 27 (80\u00a0%) employed in governmental public health. Eight alumni completed telephone interviews (response rate\u00a0=\u00a080\u00a0%). Five credited Team Epi-Aid with influencing their post-graduation career. Experience in applied public health through a group such as Team Epi-Aid may influence job choice for public health graduates.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d1c","authors":["J.
