Results on interaction energies and equilibrium distances have been evaluated through pure GGA and meta-GGA, hybrid, RSH, and double hybrid functionals. Grimme's dispersion corrections have also been assessed. All results are systematically analyzed and compared for the \u03c0-[TCNE]2(2-), \u03c0-[TTF]2(2+), \u03c0-[TCNB]2(2-), and \u03c0-[TCNP]2(2-) dimers. The DFT results are benchmarked against RASPT2 calculations based on large active spaces. It is shown that small active spaces do not quantitatively describe the interaction energy curves of these dimers. B97-D3(BJ) turns to be the functional that best reproduces the finest RASPT2 results, while PBE-D3(BJ), B3LYP-D3(BJ), and M06-L also provide satisfactory results.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bcd","authors":["Mar\u00e7al Capdevila-Cortada","Jordi Ribas-Ari\u00f1o","Juan J.
