This trend is the result of the increased number of CIEDs being implanted in a population whose multiple medical comorbidities are known to predispose to AF. Cardiac implantable electronic device-detected atrial fibrillation (CDAF) is independently associated with the development of ischemic stroke, and the annual risk may depend on both total AF burden and individual risk factors. No data evaluating the benefit of oral anticoagulation in this population are available, which makes the decision to initiate anticoagulation challenging. This review analyzes the available data on CDAF and the associated risk of ischemic stroke, and it presents a rationale for the use of long-term oral anticoagulation in this population.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61a3cf058f610007602","authors":["Decicco AE","Finkel JB","Greenspon AJ","Frisch DR"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.hrthm.2014.01.001","first_seen_on":"2014-01-14T22:20:10+00:00","issns":["1547-5271"],"issue":"","journal":"Heart Rhythm","last_mentioned_on":1390008373,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24394157"],"pmid":"24394157","pubdate":"2014-01-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Clinical Significance of Atrial Fibrillation Detected by Cardiac Implantable Electronic Devices.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-significance-atrial-fibrillation-detected-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":2317991,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2591621,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":136898,"mean":7.8590956704679,"rank":55363,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":77324,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":136898,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":608,"mean":4.782313014827,"rank":268,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":328,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":608,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":3.0048888888889,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":4,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":15,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":1,"US":1},"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CSANZCNC\/status\/423217723674341376","license":"public","citation_ids":[2043489],"posted_on":"2014-01-14T22:19:02+00:00","author":{"name":"CSANZCNC","url":"http:\/\/www.csanz.edu.au\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/659174064385224704\/F_Qyad_i_normal.png","description":"The Official Account of the Cardiovascular Nurses Council of the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand #csanz #csanz2016 #csanzcnc","id_on_source":"CSANZCNC","tweeter_id":"1532826134","geo":{"lt":-33.86785,"ln":151.20732,"country":"AU"},"followers":528},"tweet_id":"423217723674341376"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/nursingdean\/status\/424351992379867136","license":"public","rt":["CSANZCNC"],"citation_ids":[2043489],"posted_on":"2014-01-18T01:26:13+00:00","author":{"name":"Patricia Davidson","url":"http:\/\/nursing.jhu.edu\/dean","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/619162399354937344\/L9PNLvB__normal.jpg","description":"@JHUNursing Dean and @ICOWHI Counsel General with expertise in #CardiovascularHealth #GlobalHealth and #UnderservedPopulations from Sydney, Australia.","id_on_source":"nursingdean","tweeter_id":"327994582","geo":{"lt":39.29038,"ln":-76.61219,"country":"US"},"followers":5033},"tweet_id":"424351992379867136"}]}}
