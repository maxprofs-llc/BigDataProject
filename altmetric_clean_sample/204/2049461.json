The glutamate hypothesis focuses on disturbances in brain glutamatergic pathways and impairment in signaling at glutamate receptors. Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) is an MR-based technique that affords investigators the ability to study glutamate function by measuring in vivo glutamatergic indices in the brains of individuals with SCZ. (1)H-MRS studies have been performed comparing glutamatergic levels of individuals with SCZ and healthy control subjects or studying the effect of antipsychotic medications on glutamatergic levels. In this article we summarize the results of these studies by brain region. We will review the contribution of (1)H-MRS studies to our knowledge about glutamatergic abnormalities in the brains of individuals with SCZ and discuss the implications for future research and clinical care.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100034cc","authors":["Eline M P Poels","Lawrence S Kegeles","Joshua T Kantrowitz","Daniel C Javitt","Jeffrey A Lieberman","Anissa Abi-Dargham","Ragy R Girgis"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.schres.2013.12.013","first_seen_on":"2014-01-16T23:13:03+00:00","issns":["1573-2509","09209964"],"journal":"Schizophrenia Research","last_mentioned_on":1389913835,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24418122","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0920996413006919"],"pmid":"24418122","pubdate":"2014-01-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Glutamatergic abnormalities in schizophrenia: A review of proton MRS findings.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/glutamatergic-abnormalities-schizophrenia-review-proton-mrs-findings"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7657725,"mean":6.5799468761162,"rank":5792129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1031291,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7657725,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":183522,"mean":7.2502718925902,"rank":117998,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":34538,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":183522,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2526,"mean":4.9891643564356,"rank":2020,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":239,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2526,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":3.7540882352941,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Researcher":19,"Student  > Doctoral Student":12,"Student  > Ph.
