In many respects, it may be regarded as a model autoimmune disease due to its spectrum of autoimmune antibodies and involvement of different organ systems, as well as response to immunosuppressive agents which target B cells and T cells and their cytokines. A recently published article in this Journal summarized the most important knowledge about epidemiology, genetics, and immunology of LE. Here, the different clinical manifestations, diagnostic procedures and current therapeutic approaches will be described. Special emphasis is placed on different cutaneous manifestations of LE. In regard to treatment, the classic treatment approaches such as corticosteroids, methotrexate, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will be described. Lastly, new therapeutic approaches with specific monoclonal antibodies which are currently used in systemic LE, such as belimumab (Benlysta\u00ae), will be addressed. The most recent developments in this area could have implications even for purely cutaneous forms of LE.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b0f","authors":["Ziemer, Mirjana","Milkova, Linda","Kunz, Manfred"],"doi":"10.1111\/ddg.12254","endpage":"302","first_seen_on":"2014-01-15T22:38:58+00:00","issns":["1610-0387","1610-0379"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal der Deutschen Dermatologischen Gesellschaft","last_mentioned_on":1389895529,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/ddg.12254","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ddg.12254\/abstract;jsessionid=557858A9FB2C3FC11840FC2A750C544D.f04t02"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ddg.12254\/pdf","pmid":"24423191","pubdate":"2014-01-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"285","subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Lupus erythematosus.
