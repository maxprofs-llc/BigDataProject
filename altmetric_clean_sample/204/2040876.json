A cross-sectional survey was conducted using an online advertising for a period of one week. Survey participants included 1325 adults living in the United States, who had viewed the first episode of Three Rivers on television. Data were collected on recall of events in the storyline, perceived entertainment value, perceived accuracy of the presented health information, rejection of organ donation myths and positive discussion of organ donation and the storyline. Covariates were registration for organ donation, membership to the donation or transplant community and demographic variables. Results show that viewers with high recall of the storyline were more likely to reject myths about organ donation and engage in pro-donation discussions with others. Perceived entertainment value and perceived accuracy acted as mediators in such relationships. The insertion of accurate health information in television drama may be effective in promoting positive discussions about organ donation and myth rejection. Recall of events from the televised E-E drama Three Rivers, entertainment value and accuracy perception were associated with positive discussion.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f61000591d","authors":["Lance S.
