To perform this analysis, we determined Karnofsky post-operative scores (KPS) and tumor resection grades.\nPatients with a CM diagnosis were included in this study. Surgical treatment was either supported or not by IOUS. Pre- and post-operative KPS was determined by oncology team and cerebral tumor volume was estimated through pre- and post-operative MRI; surgical team determined whether it was possible to perform a total CM resection.\n78 patients were treated using surgical management (35 with and 43 without IOUS); in IOUS group post-operative KPS was higher (80 versus 70, p=0.045) and KPS evolution was superior (p=0.036), especially in the following CM subgroups: a difficulty of tumor resection ranking score<4 (p=0.037), tumor in an eloquent area (p=0.043), tumor not associated with vessels or nerves (p=0.007), and solitary lesions (p=0.038). The residual tumor volume was lower in the IOUS group (9.5% and 1.6 mm3 versus 30.8% and 9 mm3, p=0.05). In patients with a KPS\u226570, the residual tumor volume was categorized as <10% or \u226510%, and 62% of patients had <10% residual tumors (76% in the IOUS group and 45% in the non-IOUS group; p=0.032 and OR=3.8).\nIOUS may improve post-operative KPS and in decreasing residual tumor volumes in CM surgeries.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d13","authors":["Marcelo de Lima Oliveira","Helder Picarelli","Marcos Roberto Menezes","Robson Amorim","Manoel Jacobsen Teixeira","Edson Bor-Seng-Shu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.wneu.2017.03.087","first_seen_on":"2017-04-02T00:37:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["18788750","1878-8769"],"journal":"World Neurosurgery","last_mentioned_on":1491093424,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28359927\/?i=1&from=bor+seng+shu+e"],"pmid":"28359927","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["neurosurgery"],"title":"Ultrasonography During Surgery to Approach Cerebral Metastases: Effect on Karnofsky Index Scores and Tumor Volume","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ultrasonography-during-surgery-approach-cerebral-metastases-effect-karnofsky-index-scores-tumor-volu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451184,"mean":7.1040239874029,"rank":4516346,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2354304,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451184,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250143,"mean":13.148265025465,"rank":140851,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":86187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250143,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1098,"mean":2.9765615314494,"rank":356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":550,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1098,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":136,"mean":4.7565185185185,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":136,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DrRusafa\/statuses\/848333423710281728","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18396701],"posted_on":"2017-04-02T00:37:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Eloy Rusafa","url":"http:\/\/www.dreloyrusafa.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2556720380\/0hxkrdjke4qynl2cf5q6_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"DrRusafa","tweeter_id":"783279049","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":34},"tweet_id":"848333423710281728"}]}}
