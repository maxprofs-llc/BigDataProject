We assessed whether a model incorporating both the preoperative risk group and APFs could predict long-term oncologic outcomes better than a model based on APFs alone.\nWe retrospectively reviewed 4,404 men who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) at our institution between 1992 and 2014. After excluding patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy or with incomplete pathological or follow-up data, 3,092 men were included in the final analysis. APFs were defined as extraprostatic extension (EPE), seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), or a positive surgical margin (PSM). The adequacy of model fit to the data was compared using the likelihood-ratio test between the models with and without risk groups, and model discrimination was compared with the concordance index (c-index) for predicting biochemical recurrence (BCR) and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM). We performed multivariate Cox proportional hazard model and competing risk regression analyses to identify predictors of BCR and PCSM in the total patient group and each of the risk groups.\nAdding risk groups to the model containing only APFs significantly improved the fit to the data (likelihood-ratio test, p <0.001) and the c-index increased from 0.693 to 0.732 for BCR and from 0.707 to 0.747 for PCSM. A RP Gleason score (GS) \u22658 and a PSM were independently associated with BCR in the total patient group and also each risk group. However, only a GS \u22658 and SVI were associated with PCSM in the total patient group (GS \u22658: hazard ratio [HR] 5.39 and SVI: HR 3.36) and the high-risk group (GS \u22658: HR 6.31 and SVI: HR 4.05).\nThe postoperative estimation of oncologic outcomes in men with APFs at RP was improved by considering preoperative risk group stratification. Although a PSM was an independent predictor for BCR, only a RP GS \u22658 and SVI were associated with PCSM in the total patient and high-risk groups.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Won Sik Jang","Lawrence H.
