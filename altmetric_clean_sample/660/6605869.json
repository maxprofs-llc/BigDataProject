The two parameters of 18 mo-old VE pretreated rats (VEG) were significantly higher than those of 18 mo-old NVEG, and statistically comparable to those of 6 mo-old VEG. The two parameters of the 24 mo-old VEG were significantly higher in comparison with those of 24 mo-old NVEG, but still significantly lower than those of 6 mo-old VEG.\nAging has a significantly negative effect on KC energy metabolism, which can be alleviated by VE pretreatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d0f","authors":["Sun, W B","Ma, R L","Peng, Z M","Li, K","Duan, H C","Han, B L"],"doi":"10.3748\/wjg.v3.i2.78","first_seen_on":"2016-04-11T09:07:54+00:00","issns":["1007-9327"],"issue":"2","journal":"World Journal of Gastroenterology","last_mentioned_on":1460363643,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27041946"],"pmid":"27041946","pubdate":"1997-06-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Protective effect of vitamin E on age-related alterations of Kupffer cell energy metabolism.","type":"article","volume":"3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7534762,"mean":6.5107844469081,"rank":5703873,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1007673,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7534762,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271525,"mean":11.314074122361,"rank":190566,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":42459,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271525,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3323,"mean":2.7455894039735,"rank":1847,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1022,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3323,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":1.3538461538462,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/andreatognelli\/statuses\/719443380095348736","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6605869],"posted_on":"2016-04-11T08:34:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Andrea Tognelli","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/633592488414998529\/2hqS5HrP_normal.jpg","description":"Pharma & Healthcare \u2013 Publishing & Content Marketing - #antiaging","id_on_source":"andreatognelli","tweeter_id":"395180243","geo":{"lt":43.76667,"ln":11.25,"country":"IT"},"followers":958},"tweet_id":"719443380095348736"}]}}
