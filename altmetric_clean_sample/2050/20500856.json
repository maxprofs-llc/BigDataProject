Whereas risks of enteric pathogens spread through food has been assessed, the spread of fecal-oral pathogens through surfaces likely at low rates would be difficult to address through epidemiologic studies. An alternative is quantitative risk assessment. The 4-step process of hazard identification, dose-response, exposure assessment, and risk characterization can be used; however, exposure assessment may follow a complicated pathway consisting of survival and transference. Microbial hazards in the home have focused primarily on enteric bacteria. Dose-response data are available; however, the transfer from the hands to the dose is uncertain. Through day care studies, Shigella has been shown to be transferred in this manner, and a dose-response model is available. By using these data and information on the transference of bacteria between clothing and hands, risk estimates were made for contaminated laundry. Risks were calculated as high as 10 per million population to much lower levels associated with lower excretion rates of the bacteria in the feces. Approximately a 90% and 99% reduction in the probability of disease through laundering and use of a sanitizing detergent, respectively, were suggested by the models. Better data are needed on incidence of disease in the population, excretion rates over the course of an infection, amount of feces spread in the home, distribution of bacteria, survival, and the transfer of the bacteria from surfaces to the hands and to the mouth.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005709","authors":["LuAnn L.
