One of the isolates, MCCB 284, which showed rapid growth and good polymer yield, was identified as V. harveyi. The optimum conditions of the isolate for the PHB production were pH 8.0, sodium chloride concentration 20 g l(-1) , inoculum size 0.5% (v\/v), glycerol 20 g l(-1) and 72 h of incubation at 30\u00b0C. Cell dry weight of 3.2 g l(-1) , PHB content of 2.3g l(-1) and final PHB yield of 1.2 g l(-1) were achieved. The extracted PHB was characterized by FTIR, NMR and DSC-TGA techniques.\nAn isolate of Vibrio harveyi that could effectively utilize glycerol for growth and PHB accumulation was obtained from tunicate Phallusia nigra. PHB produced was up to 72% based on cell dry weight.\nThis is the first report of an isolate of Vibrio harveyi which utilizes glycerol as the sole carbon source for PHB production with high biomass yield. This isolate could be of use as candidate species for commercial PHB production using glycerol as the feed stock or as source of genes for recombinant PHB production or for synthetic biology.
