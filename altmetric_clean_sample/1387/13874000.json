The aim of the present study was to find and compare the frequency of domestic violence between methamphetamine users, patients with psychiatric disorders, and healthy people.\nIn this analytical cross-sectional study, methamphetamine users (n=30) and patients with psychiatric disorders (n=30) were women whose husbands were hospitalized during 2014 in Shafa Psychiatric Hospital in Guilan. Diagnosis was done with DSMIV-TR. Healthy people (n=60) were women whose husbands had no primary or drug induced psychiatric disorder or addiction. CTS-2 test was used to evaluate violence.\nThe frequency of psychological, physical and sexual violence in the groups suffering from psychiatric disease and methamphetamine users was higher than the healthy group (P=0.001). We observed a direct correlation between the mean of psychological and physical violence in the three groups (r=0.9, P=0.001), (r=0.7, P=0.0001) and (r=0.53, P=0.005), respectively. Direct correlation between the psychological and physical violence was only observed in the healthy group (r=0.8, P=0.007).\nThe results showed that methamphetamine users such as psychiatric patients are at increased risk of violence. Domestic violence screening of these patients is necessary. It seems that this substance is a new source of increasing domestic violence with more undesirable outcomes in Iran.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52a3cf058f610003f0a","authors":["Seyed Mohammad Rasoul Khalkhali, MD","Kiomars Najafi, MD","Reza Ahmadi, MD","Azadeh Yousefnezhad, MD","Azam Hamidi, MA","Masoumeh Ellahi, MA","Ali Amiri, MD","Afsar Montakhabi, MA","Maryam Zavarmousavi, MD"],"first_seen_on":"2016-11-22T01:50:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0253-0716"],"issue":"6","journal":"Iranian Journal of Medical Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1481463919,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5106563\/?report=classic"],"pmid":"27853328","pubdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Shiraz University Medical School","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"486","title":"Domestic Violence in Methamphetamine Psychotic Users, Psychiatric Inpatients, and Healthy People: A Comparative Study.","type":"article","volume":"41"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":2.6,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7876706,"mean":6.669712343671,"rank":3118838,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4733777,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7876706,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252834,"mean":12.151150395715,"rank":94589,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":156830,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252834,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118,"mean":1.875641025641,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":103,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":2.3,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":4,"FR":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Why_We_Do_That\/statuses\/800879006962749440","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13874000],"posted_on":"2016-11-22T01:50:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Why_We_Do_That","url":"http:\/\/hiv-insight.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/779459146\/Rorschach_4_normal.jpg","description":"Psychology; how, why & what not.
