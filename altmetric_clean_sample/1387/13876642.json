Correlation of radiographic findings with clinical symptoms is often difficult. Limited evidence currently exists to support the use of bone single-photon emission computed tomography\/computed tomography (SPECT\/CT) in this subgroup of patients. The aim of this study was to describe the scintigraphic patterns of joint arthropathy at the CVJ on bone SPECT\/CT in patients with suboccipital\/neck pain and cervicogenic headache. Patients with\u2009more than 3 months of suboccipital\/neck pain\/cervicogenic headache and abnormal SPECT\/CT findings at the CVJ were included. Patients with known\/suspected malignancy, trauma, infectious processes and previous surgery at the CVJ were excluded. Neck disability index (NDI), visual analogue scale (VAS) and treatment were recorded for each patient. Patterns of osteoblastic activity at the CVJ on bone SPECT\/CT were described and correlated with arthritic changes on conventional scans. Eighteen patients were included (10 females, mean age 68). Mean NDI score was 22. Mean VAS was 7.5. On bone SPECT\/CT, it was found that 13 patients had high osteoblastic activity unilaterally at the atlanto-axial joint (AAJ); two patients at the atlanto-dental joint (ADJ), one at the occipito-atlantal joint (OAJ), one at both OAJ and ADJ and one at the level of C2 pars\/pedicle unilaterally. Metabolic activity on SPECT\/CT was associated with severe degenerative changes on CT scans. The ability of hybrid bone SPECT\/CT to precisely localize osteoblastic activity at the CVJ may provide significant improvement in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with suboccipital\/neck pain and joint arthropathy at the CVJ. Further clinical studies are needed to establish the real clinical impact of bone SPECT\/CT in the treatment of patients with suboccipital neck pain.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51f3cf058f6100039f9","authors":["Vittorio M.
