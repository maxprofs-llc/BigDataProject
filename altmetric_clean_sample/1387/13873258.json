It is confirmed that they can also convert alpha-linolenic acid (LNA, 18:3 n-3) to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 n-3) and to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6 n-3) in vivo. The time course and the maximal response for these processes during the first week after a single dose of the 18-carbon precursor is described. A stable-isotope method in which the protons of the C17 and C18 carbons are substituted with deuterium atoms is used in order to provide for a safe method for the study of human metabolism. High sensitivity and selectivity of detection is assured with negative ion, gas chromatography\/mass spectrometry analysis. It is clear that human adults on an ad lib diet carry out EFA metabolism in vivo.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f610008641","authors":["N. Salem","R. Pawlosky","B. Wegher","J.
