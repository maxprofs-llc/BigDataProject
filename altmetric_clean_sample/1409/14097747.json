The 3 HIIT protocols involved repeated 30 s bursts of treadmill walking at maximum speed alternated with rest periods of 30 s (P30), 1 min (P60) or 2 min (P120). Sessions were performed in random order and included 5 min warm up, 20 min HIIT and 5 min cool down. Variables measured included ECG activity, BP, HR, signs and symptoms of CV intolerance, and orthopedic concerns. Generalized linear mixed models and Tukey-Kramer adjustment were used to compare protocols using p <0.05.\nNo signs or symptoms of CV intolerance, significant arrhythmias, ST changes or orthopedic responses resulted in early termination of any HIIT session. HIIT elicited HR's in excess of 88% of measured HRpeak including 6 (P30), 8 (P60) and 2 (P120) participants eliciting a HR response above their GXT HRpeak. Both, maximum BP and HR were significantly higher in P30 and P60 relative to P120.\nPreliminary data indicate that persons with chronic stroke who have been pre-screened with an ECG stress test, a symptom-limited GXT, and a harness for fall protection; may safely participate in HIIT generating substantially higher HR's than what is seen in traditional moderate intensity training.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000ceb","authors":["Dr. Daniel L Carl"],"doi":"10.1139\/apnm-2016-0369","first_seen_on":"2016-11-27T05:56:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1715-5312","1715-5320"],"journal":"Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1480414329,"links":["http:\/\/www.nrcresearchpress.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1139\/apnm-2016-0369"],"pmid":"28177746","pubdate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology","metabolism","sportsmedicine","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Preliminary safety analysis of High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) in persons with chronic stroke","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/preliminary-safety-analysis-highintensity-interval-training-hiit-persons-chronic-stroke-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":2.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7822782,"mean":6.6331385505942,"rank":3010040,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4779316,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7822782,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250742,"mean":12.183718163363,"rank":89285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":159667,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250742,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1099,"mean":13.66485428051,"rank":541,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":551,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1099,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":24.495055555556,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
