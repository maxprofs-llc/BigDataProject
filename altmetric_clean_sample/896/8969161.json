The present study intended to investigate the involvement of cannabinoid CB1 receptors of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in cross state-dependent memory retrieval between morphine and ethanol. Adult male Wistar rats received bilateral cannulation of the BLA, and memory retrieval was measured in step-through type passive avoidance apparatus. Our results showed that post-training intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of morphine (6mg\/kg) induced amnesia. Pre-test administration of ethanol (0.5g\/kg, i.p.) significantly improved morphine-induced memory impairment, suggesting that there is cross state-dependent memory retrieval between morphine and ethanol. It should be considered that pre-test administration of ethanol (0.1 and 0.5g\/kg, i.p.) by itself had no effect on memory retrieval in the passive avoidance task. Interestingly, pre-test intra-BLA microinjection of different doses of WIN55,212-2 (0.1, 0.2 and 0.3\u03bcg\/rat), a non-selective CB1\/CB2 receptor agonist, plus an ineffective dose of ethanol (0.1g\/kg, i.p.) improved morphine-induced memory impairment. Intra-BLA microinjection of AM251 (0.4-0.6ng\/rat), a selective CB1 receptor antagonist, inhibited the improved effect of ethanol (0.5g\/kg, i.p.) on morphine response. Pre-test intra-BLA microinjection of WIN55,212-2 or AM251 had no effect on memory retrieval or morphine-induced amnesia. Taken together, it can be concluded that morphine and ethanol can induce state-dependent memory retrieval. In addition, the BLA endocannabinoid system mediates via CB1 receptors the functional interaction of morphine and ethanol state-dependent memory retrieval which may depend on the rewarding effects of the drugs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032e3","authors":["Ofogh, Sattar Norouzi","Rezayof, Ameneh","Sardari, Maryam","Ghasemzadeh, Zahra"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pbb.2016.06.008","first_seen_on":"2016-06-22T13:31:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-5177"],"journal":"Pharmacology, Biochemistry & Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1466593097,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27327764?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27327764","pubdate":"2016-06-22T22:00:18+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychopharmacology","behavioralsciences","pharmacology","biochemistry"],"title":"Basolateral amygdala CB1 cannabinoid receptors are involved in cross state-dependent memory retrieval between morphine and ethanol.","type":"article","volume":"148","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/basolateral-amygdala-cb1-cannabinoid-receptors-involved-cross-statedependent-memory-retrieval-betwee"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7931561,"mean":6.7081498191978,"rank":6865879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7931561,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262170,"mean":11.566576772997,"rank":219587,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262170,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1521,"mean":3.7470276315789,"rank":1282,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1521,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.1208333333333,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
