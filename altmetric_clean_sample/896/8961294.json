While participatory research enhances understanding, robust methodologies are necessary to translate emerging concepts into viable communication approaches. Communicators and change agents need to clarify pathways for change, barriers and enablers for change, as well as the role, orientation, and content of communication to support change. While various approaches to participatory action research with vulnerable communities have been developed, there is a dearth of methodologies that address the formulation of communication concepts that can be applied at scale.\nThe Action Media methodology has been refined over a period of two decades, being applied to addressing HIV, related aspects such as gender-based violence, as well as broader issues, such as maternal and child health, sanitation, and malaria in Africa, The Caribbean, and Asia. The approach employs a sequence of interactive sessions involving communicator researchers and participants from one or more communities that face social or health challenges. Sessions focus on understanding audiences through their engagement with these challenges and leading to shaping of relevant communication concepts that can be linked to mobilization for change.\nThe Action Media methodology contributes to processes of shared learning linked to addressing social and health challenges. This includes determining priorities, identifying barriers and facilitators for change, understanding processes of mobilizing knowledge in relation to context, determining appropriate communication approaches, and integrating indigenous language and cultural perspectives into communication concepts. Emerging communication strategies include support to systematic action and long-term mobilization.\nCommunication to address public health concerns is typically developed through expert-led didactic approaches that, at best, engage audiences at the end of the development cycle through pretesting of communication concepts. Action Media provides an alternative approach that can be utilized to inform communication by integrating community perspectives at the outset. Notwithstanding the focused engagement with small group representative of health-vulnerable subpopulations, Action Media findings have informed large-scale communication interventions. The approach is directly linked to enabling ownership, critical thinking, and mobilization of knowledge for change.","altmetric_jid":"52f8bc933cf058d4628b4570","authors":["Parker, Warren Martin","Becker-Benton, Antje"],"doi":"10.3389\/fpubh.2016.00128","first_seen_on":"2016-06-22T07:00:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2296-2565"],"journal":"Frontiers in Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1478132330,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpubh.2016.00128\/full?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27446894?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpubh.2016.00128\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpubh.2016.00128\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4916173","pmid":"27446894","pubdate":"2016-06-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Experiences in Conducting Participatory Communication Research for HIV Prevention Globally: Translating Critical Dialog into Action through Action Media","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/experiences-conducting-participatory-communication-research-hiv-prevention-globally-translating-crit"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.45,"score_history":{"1y":3.45,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7639268,"mean":6.5692022176954,"rank":1750310,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":5879566,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7639268,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259875,"mean":11.524979882558,"rank":77445,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":181822,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259875,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":932,"mean":7.843477980666,"rank":239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":687,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":932,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71,"mean":15.359257142857,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
