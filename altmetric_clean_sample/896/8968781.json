It has exhibited a high level of resistance over the last two decades. Genetic mapping of recombinant inbred lines derived from the cross Ukrainka\/Mv Homb\u00e1r located this gene on the chromosome 2AL. The segregation ratio and consistent effect in all environments indicated that PmHo is a major dominant powdery mildew resistance gene. The race-specific nature of resistance in Mv Homb\u00e1r was shown by the emergence of a single virulent pathotype designated as 51-Ho. This pathotype was, to some extent, able to infect Mv Homb\u00e1r, developing visible symptoms with sporulating colonies. Microscopic studies revealed that, in incompatible interactions, post-haustorial hypersensitivity reaction was the most prevalent but not exclusive plant defence response in Mv Homb\u00e1r, and fungal growth was mostly arrested during haustorium formation or in the early stages of colony development. The delayed fungal development of the virulent pathotype 51-Ho may be explained by additional effects of other loci that were also involved in the powdery mildew resistance of Mv Homb\u00e1r.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003329","authors":["Kom\u00e1romi, Judit","Jankovics, T\u00fcnde","Fabian, Attila","Pusk\u00e1s, Katalin","Zhang, Zengyan","Zhang, Miao","Li, Hongjie","Jager, Katalin","L\u00e1ng, L\u00e1szl\u00f3","Vida, Gyula","Judit Kom\u00e1romi","T\u00fcnde Jankovics","Attila F\u00e1bi\u00e1n","Katalin Pusk\u00e1s","Zengyan Zhang","Miao Zhang","Hongjie Li","Katalin J\u00e4ger","L\u00e1szl\u00f3 L\u00e1ng","Gyula Vida"],"doi":"10.1094\/phyto-03-16-0152-r","first_seen_on":"2016-06-22T13:23:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0031-949X"],"journal":"Phytopathology","last_mentioned_on":1498850198,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27327577?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27327577?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27327577","pubdate":"2016-06-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["botany"],"title":"Powdery mildew resistance in wheat cultivar Mv Homb\u00e1r is conferred by a new gene PmHo.","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":4201377,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":4180268,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266408,"mean":11.754984343504,"rank":128819,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":134926,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266408,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":936,"mean":3.3662652406417,"rank":612,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":320,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":936,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":3.9641290322581,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IN":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/wheatgen_papers\/statuses\/745567786814996480","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8968781],"posted_on":"2016-06-22T10:43:07+00:00","author":{"name":"wheatgeneticspapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/733367645110697984\/BAVxZibA_normal.jpg","description":"Twitterbot of wheat genetics papers appearing in #PubMed\/#bioRxiv.
