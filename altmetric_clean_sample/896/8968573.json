Its intraoperative use with the intention of improving anatomical results has recently been described.\nTo determine the usefulness and safety of optical coherence tomography during pars plana vitrectomy for several vitreo-retinal diseases.\nA prospective case series is reported, in which the decision that influenced the use of the optical coherence tomography imaging during pars plana vitrectomy is evaluated. A RESCAN 700 microscope that includes a spectral domain tomography was used to obtain the images. At the end of each procedure the surgeons completed a questionnaire to determine if the tomographic image had an influence when making decisions during the surgery, or change the decision during the procedure.\nThirteen patients with pars plana vitrectomy were included, with cataract surgery also performed in 6 patients. The surgeon considered that the intraoperative image influenced the decision during the procedure in 8 cases.\nIntraoperative optical coherence tompgraphy is helpful for a safe patient diagnosis. It does not affect the surgery time, and in some cases it is useful for optimising the procedure in vitreous-retinal surgery.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e43cf058f610005690","authors":["Ram\u00edrez-Estudillo, Juan Abel","S\u00e1nchez-Ramos, Jorge Arturo","P\u00e9rez-Monta\u00f1o, Carla Roc\u00edo","Gonz\u00e1lez-Cort\u00e9s, Jes\u00fas Hern\u00e1n"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.circir.2016.04.002","first_seen_on":"2016-06-22T13:16:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0009-7411"],"journal":"Cirugia y Cirujanos","last_mentioned_on":1466591539,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27324930?dopt=Abstract#pubmed"],"pmid":"27324930","pubdate":"2016-06-22T22:01:15+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cultural Studies","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Literary Studies","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Communication And Media Studies","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Arts and Humanities"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"[Intraoperative use of coherence tomography in vitreoretinal surgery].","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/utilidad-transquirrgica-la-tomografa-coherencia-ptica-en-ciruga-vtreoretiniana"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7931561,"mean":6.7081498191978,"rank":6865880,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7931561,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262170,"mean":11.566596226098,"rank":219589,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262170,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":200,"mean":1.2385226130653,"rank":122,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":200,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.58333333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OCTMD\/statuses\/745565072156659712","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8968573],"posted_on":"2016-06-22T10:32:19+00:00","author":{"name":"Brandon Lujan, MD","url":"http:\/\/OCTMD.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/459117248297189376\/n_gr2d1r_normal.jpeg","description":"Medical Retina and Imaging Specialist with Expertise in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT).","id_on_source":"OCTMD","tweeter_id":"244660420","geo":{"lt":37.77493,"ln":-122.41942,"country":"US"},"followers":1320},"tweet_id":"745565072156659712"}]}}
