The present study sought to examine the outcomes of patients with \u22643\u00a0cm HCC after ablation versus resection.\nPatients treated by ablation or surgical resection for \u2264\u00a03\u00a0cm T1 HCC were identified from the National Cancer Database (2002-2011). Survival outcomes were analysed according to propensity score modelling.\nA total of 2804 patients underwent ablation (n\u00a0=\u00a01984) or a resection (n\u00a0=\u00a0820) for solitary HCC \u2264\u00a03\u00a0cm. Patients treated with ablation as compared with a resection had a higher frequency in alpha-fetoprotein level (AFP) elevation (46.5% versus 39.1%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and the presence of cirrhosis (22.2% versus 14.5%, P < 0.01). Unadjusted overall survival (OS) at 3 and 5\u00a0years was greater after a resection (67%, 55%) versus ablation (52%, 36%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). After propensity score matching, the improved overall survival (OS) was sustained among the resection cohort (5\u00a0year OS: 54% versus 37%, P < 0.001). In multivariable models, a resection was independently associated with an improved OS [hazard ratio (HR): 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.48-0.81; P < 0.01].\nResection of HCC \u2264\u00a03\u00a0cm results in better long-term survival as compared with ablation. Treatment strategies for small solitary HCC should emphasize a resection first approach, with ablation being reserved for patients precluded from surgery.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002a03","authors":["Miura, John T","Johnston, Fabian M","Tsai, Susan","Eastwood, Dan","Banerjee, Anjishnu","Christians, Kathleen K","Turaga, Kiran K","Gamblin, T Clark"],"doi":"10.1111\/hpb.12446","endpage":"901","first_seen_on":"2016-06-22T13:04:33+00:00","issns":["1477-2574","1365182X"],"issue":"10","journal":"HPB: The Official Journal of the International Hepato Pacreato Biliary Association","last_mentioned_on":1466590396,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26228076?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26228076","pubdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"896","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Surgical resection versus ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma \u2264\u00a03\u00a0cm: a population-based analysis","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/surgical-resection-versus-ablation-hepatocellular-carcinoma-3-cm-populationbased-analysis-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7931561,"mean":6.7081498191978,"rank":6865892,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7931561,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262171,"mean":11.566566983255,"rank":219596,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262171,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":511,"mean":1.5956352941176,"rank":343,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":511,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":2.2253636363636,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/statuses\/745560277152763906","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8968105],"posted_on":"2016-06-22T10:13:16+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":383},"tweet_id":"745560277152763906"}]}}
