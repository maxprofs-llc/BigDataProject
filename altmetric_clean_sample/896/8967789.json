Selective and even cell type-specific inhibition of NF-\u03baB signaling may offer a new way to treat various liver diseases including fulminant hepatitis. To reveal the potential use of thioalkylated mannose-modified dendrimer (generation 3; G3) conjugates with \u03b1-cyclodextrin with average degree of substitution of mannose (DSM4) (Man-S-\u03b1-CDE (G3, DSM4)) as a novel antigen presenting cell (APC)-specific siRNA carrier, we evaluated the RNAi effect of NF-\u03baB p65 siRNA (sip65) complex with Man-S-\u03b1-CDE (G3, DSM4) both in vitro and in vivo. Man-S-\u03b1-CDE (G3, DSM4)\/sip65 complex significantly suppressed NF-\u03baB p65 mRNA expression and nitric oxide (NO) production from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated NR8383 cells, a rat alveolar macrophage cell line, by adequate physicochemical properties and mannose receptor-mediated cellular uptake. Intravenous injection of Man-S-\u03b1-CDE (G3, DSM4)\/sip65 complex extended the survival rate of LPS-induced fulminant hepatitis model mice. In addition, intravenous administration of Man-S-\u03b1-CDE (G3, DSM4)\/sip65 complex had the potential to induce the in vivo RNAi effect by significant suppression of mRNA expression of NF-\u03baB p65, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) in the liver of fulminant hepatitis model mice induced by LPS\/D-galactosamine (D-Gal) without any significant side effects. Also, the serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase levels were significantly attenuated by injection of Man-S-\u03b1-CDE (G3, DSM4)\/sip65 complex in fulminant hepatitis model mice. Taken together, these results suggest that Man-S-\u03b1-CDE (G3, DSM4) has the potential as a novel APC-selective sip65 carrier for the treatment of LPS\/D-Gal-induced fulminant hepatitis in mice.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c9","authors":["Motoyama, Keiichi","Mitsuyasu, Ryosuke","Akao, Chiho","Abu Hashim, Irhan Ibrahim","Sato, Nana","Tanaka, Takahiro","Higashi, Taishi","Arima, Hidetoshi"],"doi":"10.1021\/mp500814f","endpage":"3136","first_seen_on":"2016-06-22T12:58:17+00:00","issns":["1543-8392","1543-8384"],"issue":"9","journal":"Molecular Pharmaceutics","last_mentioned_on":1466589968,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26270769?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26270769","pubdate":"2015-09-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"3129","subjects":["molecularbiology","pharmacology"],"title":"Potential Use of Thioalkylated Mannose-Modified Dendrimer (G3)\/\u03b1-Cyclodextrin Conjugate as an NF-\u03baB siRNA Carrier for the Treatment of Fulminant Hepatitis","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/potential-thioalkylated-mannosemodified-dendrimer-g3cyclodextrin-conjugate-nfb-sirna-carrier-treatme"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7931561,"mean":6.7081498191978,"rank":4160974,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2212673,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7931561,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262171,"mean":11.566580333371,"rank":142085,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":93900,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262171,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1132,"mean":5.1307515473033,"rank":443,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":540,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1132,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":18.59075862069,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
