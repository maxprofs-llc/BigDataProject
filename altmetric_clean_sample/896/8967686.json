Treatment against MAB is difficult, characterized by its intrinsic antibiotic drug-resistance. Lysine acetylation can alter the physiochemical property of proteins in living organisms. This study aimed to determine if this protein post-translational modification (PTM) exists in a clinical isolate M. abscessus GZ002. We used the anti-acetyl-lysine immunoprecipitation to enrich the low-abundant PTM proteins, followed by the LC-MS\/MS analysis. The lysine acetylome of M. abscessus GZ002 was determined. There were 459 lysine acetylation sites found in 289 acetylated proteins. Lysine acetylation occurred in 5.87 % of the M. abscessus GZ002 proteome and at least 25 % of them were growth essential. Aerobic respiration and carbohydrate metabolic pathways of M. abscessus GZ002 were enriched with lysine acetylation. Through bioinformatics analysis, we identified four major acetyl motif logos (KacY, KacF, KacH and DKac). Further comparison of the reported M. tuberculosis (MTB) acetylomes and that of MAB GZ002 revealed several common features between these two species. The lysine residues of several antibiotic-resistance, virulence and persistence-related proteins were acetylated in both MAB GZ002 and MTB. There were 51 identical acetylation sites in 37 proteins found in common between MAB GZ002 and MTB. Overall, we demonstrate a profile of lysine acetylation in MAB GZ002 proteome that shares similarities with MTB. Interventions that target at these conserved sections may be valuable as anti-NTM and\/or anti-TB therapies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e0f","authors":["Guo, Jintao","Wang, Changwei","Han, Yi","Liu, Zhiyong","Wu, Tian","Liu, Yan","Liu, Yang","Tan, Yaoju","Cai, Xinshan","Cao, Yuanyuan","Wang, Bangxing","Zhang, Buchang","Liu, Chunping","Tan, Shouyong","Zhang, Tianyu","Jintao Guo"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jproteome.6b00116","first_seen_on":"2016-06-22T12:56:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1535-3907","1535-3893"],"issue":"8","journal":"Journal of Proteome Research","last_mentioned_on":1467328648,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27323652?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jproteome.6b00116"],"pmid":"27323652","pubdate":"2016-06-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"\n              Identification of Lysine Acetylation in\n              Mycobacterium abscessus\n              Using LC-MS\/MS after Immunoprecipitation\n            ","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-lysine-acetylation-mycobacterium-abscessus-using-lcmsms-after-immunoprecipitation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7971101,"mean":6.7313029448827,"rank":3713223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":4079530,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7971101,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262597,"mean":11.568292989992,"rank":119076,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":134948,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262597,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2807,"mean":3.7233243050606,"rank":1046,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":1576,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2807,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117,"mean":5.7519827586207,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
