G-CSF concentrations are used to directly regulate neutrophil production, with the rate of differentiation of stem cells to neutrophil precursors, the effective proliferation rate in mitosis, the maturation time, and the release rate from the mature marrow reservoir into circulation all dependent on the level of G-CSF in the system. The dependence of the maturation time on the cytokine concentration introduces a state-dependent delay into our differential equation model, and we show how this is derived from an age-structured partial differential equation model of the mitosis and maturation and also detail the derivation of the rest of our model. The model and its estimated parameters are shown to successfully predict the neutrophil and G-CSF responses to a variety of treatment scenarios, including the combined administration of chemotherapy and exogenous G-CSF. This concomitant treatment was reproduced without any additional fitting to characterize drug-drug interactions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002471","authors":["Craig, M","Humphries, A R","Mackey, M C","M.
