MicroRNAs regulate cellular processes including inflammation and may be detected in blood. We aimed to establish definitive proof-of-principle that circulating microRNAs are differentially affected during sepsis and non-infective SIRS. Critically ill patients with severe (n\u2009=\u200921) or non-severe (n\u2009=\u20098) intra-abdominal sepsis; severe (n\u2009=\u200923) or non-severe (n\u2009=\u200921) non-infective SIRS; or no SIRS (n\u2009=\u200916) were studied. Next-generation sequencing and qRT-PCR were used to measure plasma microRNAs. Detectable blood miRNAs (n\u2009=\u2009116) were generally up-regulated in SIRS compared to no-SIRS patients. Levels of these 'circulating inflammation-related microRNAs' (CIR-miRNAs) were 2.64 (IQR: 2.10-3.29) and 1.52 (IQR: 1.15-1.92) fold higher for non-infective SIRS and sepsis respectively (p\u2009<\u20090.0001), hence CIR-miRNAs appeared less abundant in sepsis than in SIRS. Six CIR-miRNAs (miR-30d-5p, miR-30a-5p, miR-192-5p, miR-26a-5p, miR-23a-5p, miR-191-5p) provided good-to-excellent discrimination of severe sepsis from severe SIRS (0.742-0.917 AUC of ROC curves). CIR-miRNA levels inversely correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6 and others). Thus, among critically ill patients, sepsis and non-infective SIRS are associated with substantial, differential changes in CIR-miRNAs. CIR-miRNAs may be regulators of inflammation and warrant thorough evaluation as diagnostic and therapeutic targets.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Caserta, Stefano","Kern, Florian","Cohen, Jonathan","Drage, Stephen","Newbury, Sarah F","Llewelyn, Martin J","Stefano Caserta","Florian Kern","Jonathan Cohen","Stephen Drage","Sarah F.
