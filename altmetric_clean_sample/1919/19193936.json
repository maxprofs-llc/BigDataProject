To date there is a lack of prospective research on the timings and the development of sleep problems in those who have LBP, such information would be useful to identify individuals at risk of poor outcome. Aims are to investigate the predictive role of sleep problems on self-report recovery and pain intensity using logistic regression reporting Odds Ratios (OR). An observational cohort of 761 chronic LBP patients recruited from a pain management clinic participated, and completed data at baseline, and at 6 month follow-up (n = 682). Results show an increased odds of reported non-recovery (OR 1.52) and pain intensity (OR 2.69) for those who report sleep problems at baseline. Further analysis on the experience of sleep problems through time show that those with developing sleep problems (i.e. no sleep problems at baseline but reported sleep problems at follow-up) were at increased odds of reporting non-recovery (OR 2.17) and pain intensity (OR 2.95), as was those who reported sleep problems at both baseline and follow-up, for recovery (OR 2.88), and pain intensity (OR 3.45). Those with resolving sleep problems (i.e. sleep problems present at baseline but not at follow-up) were at a decreased odds of non-recovery (OR 0.50) and pain intensity (0.49). Presenting, persistent, and developing sleep problems have a significant impact on recovery for those with LBP, clinicians may wish to consider treatment options that can address sleep problems.
