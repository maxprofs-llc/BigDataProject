PRL levels have been investigated in several autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis (MS); however, these have yielded different and inconsistent results. This study aims to perform a more precise evaluation on the plasma\/serum PRL levels in MS patients, and to explore the available influential factors.\nResearch related to plasma\/serum PRL levels in MS patients and healthy controls were gathered using PubMed, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library database (until Mar 31 2016). Pooled standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated by fixed-effects or random-effect model analysis. Heterogeneity test was performed by the Q statistic and quantified using I(2), and publication bias was evaluated using a funnel plot and Egger's linear regression test.\n516 articles were obtained after searching databases, and 8 studies with 426 MS patients and 296 controls were finally included. Meta-analysis revealed that, compared with the control group, the MS group had significantly higher plasma\/serum PRL levels, with the SMD of 0.55 and 95%CI (0.39, 0.72). Subgroup analyses showed that region, age and disease duration were associated with PRL level in MS patients.\nIn summary, our meta-analysis revealed a significantly higher PRL level in MS patients than healthy controls, and it is influenced by region, age and disease duration.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005c40","authors":["Wei Wei","Lei Liu","Zhong-Le Cheng","Bo Hu"],"doi":"10.1080\/00325481.2017.1282297","first_seen_on":"2017-04-20T05:24:36+00:00","issns":["0032-5481","1941-9260"],"journal":"Postgraduate Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1492665862,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/00325481.2017.1282297?af=R"],"pmid":"28120634","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Increased plasma\/serum levels of prolactin in multiple sclerosis: a meta-analysis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increased-plasmaserum-levels-prolactin-multiple-sclerosis-metaanalysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8089090,"mean":6.870452360944,"rank":6141699,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1087155,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8089090,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233183,"mean":12.779277602902,"rank":165220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":43279,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233183,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":628,"mean":4.2801180223285,"rank":426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":628,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":7.4260869565217,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/postgradmed\/statuses\/854928709790388224","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19193016],"posted_on":"2017-04-20T05:24:22+00:00","author":{"name":"PostgraduateMedicine","url":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/loi\/ipgm20","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/763706418641899520\/RxU7E_JL_normal.jpg","description":"Peer-reviewed medical journal publishing timely medical research for physicians.
