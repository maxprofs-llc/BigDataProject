The 2 main camps are divided into those who believe in the hemiarch resection utilizing hypothermic circulatory arrest and those who feel that the same goal can be accomplished with just an ascending aortic resection with an aortic cross clamp. While this debate continues to happen within groups and in some cases even in the same hospital, it certainly has not happened in the literature. There are no studies directly comparing the safety and efficacy of these 2 ideologies. The aim of this review is to present the little data that do exist and to ultimately show that the hemiarch technique is superior after careful deliberation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f6100088ef","authors":["R.
