Recent research has shown that these ion channels have the potential to be converted into nanovalves through clever use of magnetic nanoparticles and magnetic fields. Using a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the finite element (FE) modelling, this study investigates the theoretical feasibility of opening the MscL channel (MS channel of large conductance of E. coli) by applying mechanical force directly to its N-terminus. This region has already been reported to function as a major mechanosensor in this channel. The stress-strain behaviour of each MscL helix was obtained using all atom MD simulations. Using the same method, we simulated two models, the wild-type (WT) MscL and the G22N mutant MscL, both embedded in a POPE lipid bilayer. In addition to indicating the main interacting residues at the hydrophobic pore, their pairwise interaction energies were monitored during the channel gating. We implemented these inputs into our FE model of MscL using curve-fitting codes and continuum mechanics equations. In the FE model, the channel could be fully opened via pulling directly on the N-terminus and bottom of TM1 by mutating dominant van der Waals interactions in the channel pore; otherwise the stress generated on the channel protein can irreversibly unravel the N-secondary structure. This is a significant finding suggesting that applying force in this manner is sufficient to open an MscL nanovalve delivering various drugs used, for example, in cancer chemotherapy. More importantly, the FE model indicates that to fully operate an MscL nanovalve by pulling directly on the N-terminus and bottom of TM1, gain-of-function (GOF) mutants (e.g., G22N MscL) would have to be employed rather than the WT MscL channel.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Adam D.
