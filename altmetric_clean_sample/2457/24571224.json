Previous studies have indicated that NAFLD has an adverse effect on the quality of life, but information is lacking about the impact of NAFLD on female sexual dysfunction. The aim of this study was to determine the association between NAFLD and female sexual dysfunction in premenopausal women.\nThis retrospective study consisted of premenopausal women who were sexually active and visited the outpatient clinic for a routine health check-up between January 2010 and December 2011. Based on the examination of the liver ultrasound scan, the study population was divided into 2 groups: cases with NAFLD and normal controls (cases without NAFLD). The female sexual function was compared between the two groups of cases. For the assessment of sexual function, a female sexual function index (FSFI) questionnaire was used.\nFour hundred seventy women were included, and the prevalence of NAFLD and female sexual dysfunction were 67\/470 (14.3%) and 238\/470 (50.6%), respectively. Cases with NAFLD had a lower total FSFI score and higher rate of female sexual dysfunction than the normal control [median score of total FSFI (interquartile range): 24.7 (21.9-27.8) in NAFLD vs. 26.7 (23.7-29.8) in normal control, p<0.005; the female sexual dysfunction: 64.2% in NAFLD vs. 48.4% in normal control, p<0.05]. This difference in female sexual dysfunction between the two groups remained significant after adjustment.\nNAFLD is associated with female sexual dysfunction in premenopausal women.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Jae Yeon Lee","Dong Wook Shin","Jeong Won Oh","Won Kim","Sae Kyung Joo","Myung Jae Jeon","Sun Min Kim","Jae Moon Yun","Ki Young Son","Jin
