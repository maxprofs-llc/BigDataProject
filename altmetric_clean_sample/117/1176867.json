Although soluble CD4 (sCD4) can inactivate laboratory-adapted HIV-1 strains, it fails to reduce the viral loads in clinical trials because of its low potency against primary isolates and tendency to enhance HIV-1 infection at low concentration. Thus, it is essential to design a better HIV inactivator with improved potency for developing new anti-HIV therapeutics that can actively attack the virus in the circulation before it attaches to and enter into the target cell.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5323cf058f6100044b1","doi":"10.1186\/1742-4690-9-104","first_seen_on":"2013-01-15T13:24:37+00:00","issns":["1742-4690"],"issue":"1","journal":"Retrovirology: Research & Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1414022964,"links":["http:\/\/www.retrovirology.com\/content\/9\/1\/104","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3531269\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.retrovirology.com\/content\/pdf\/1742-4690-9-104.pdf","pmid":"23217195","pubdate":"2012-12-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Virology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"104","title":"A bivalent recombinant protein inactivates HIV-1 by targeting the gp41 prehairpin fusion intermediate induced by CD4 D1D2 domains","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bivalent-recombinant-protein-inactivates-hiv1-targeting-gp41-prehairpin-fusion-intermediate-induced"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.18,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.18},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8029773,"mean":6.8058472945396,"rank":784227,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7245478,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8029773,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":307501,"mean":6.7111188097561,"rank":36755,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":270744,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":307501,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":449,"mean":3.50415625,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":416,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":449,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":1.45664,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
