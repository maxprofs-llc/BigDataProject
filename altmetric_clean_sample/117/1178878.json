The most effective means to introduce exogenous DNA into P. falciparum is via passive uptake following invasion into a DNA-loaded erythrocyte. Using bioluminescence as a tool to quantify transfection efficiency, parameters previously judged empirically to enhance transfection efficiency were subjected to a quantitative analysis. This report supports roles for fresh erythrocytes and growth medium supplemented with human serum in enhancing transfection efficiency. Critically, a proposed enhancement to transfection efficiency through continued feeding with DNA-loaded erythrocytes is not borne out in this study, and actually appears to be detrimental.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f61000310c","doi":"10.1016\/j.molbiopara.2013.01.001","first_seen_on":"2013-01-16T09:58:59+00:00","funders":["bbsrc"],"issns":["1872-9428"],"journal":"Molecular & Biochemical Parasitology","last_mentioned_on":1365910618,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23313825"],"pmid":"23313825","pubdate":"2013-01-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","parasitology","biochemistry"],"title":"A quantitative analysis of Plasmodium falciparum transfection using DNA-loaded erythrocytes.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quantitative-analysis-plasmodium-falciparum-transfection-using-dnaloaded-erythrocytes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":1688899,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":2794219,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284859,"mean":5.9767009387133,"rank":90137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":192373,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284859,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":395,"mean":1.9797817258883,"rank":185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":210,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":395,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.92727272727273,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
