The increase in production of LH, above basal values, in response to injection of 0.25 microgram GnRH midway through perfusion was only slightly greater (P greater than 0.05) in boars receiving cortisol compared to that when the same boars received saline. When 0.5 microgram GnRH was injected midway through perfusion, a significantly greater (P less than 0.05) increase in production of LH above basal levels occurred during cortisol administration than occurred when saline was given. Injection of 1.0 microgram GnRH in boars during cortisol perfusion resulted in significantly greater (P less than 0.01) production of LH, above basal levels, compared to the increase above basal levels that resulted when this dose of GnRH was given during intracarotid saline treatment. Increases in plasma values of testosterone reflected the increases in levels of LH. The results suggest that acute elevations in plasma cortisol may, under some circumstances, enhance the increased production of LH in the boar by increasing the responsiveness of the anterior pituitary gland to GnRH.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d78","authors":["Liptrap, R M","Raeside, J I"],"first_seen_on":"2013-01-14T20:41:16+00:00","issns":["0022-0795"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1358186760,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/6341497"],"pmid":"6341497","pubdate":"1983-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Effect of cortisol on the response to gonadotrophin releasing hormone in the boar.","type":"article","volume":"97","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-cortisol-response-gonadotrophin-releasing-hormone-boar"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.312,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.312},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685110,"mean":4.9302723403875,"rank":490166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":3194785,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685110,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279723,"mean":5.7440561772049,"rank":45256,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":234467,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279723,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":456,"mean":2.5670637362637,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":417,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":456,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":4.306,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Environmental Science":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"BR":1}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Gingrey is a bad doctor, says science","url":"http:\/\/rss.sciam.com\/~r\/science-sushi\/feed\/~3\/gqVSBAhAvTo\/","citation_ids":[1175411,1175412,997569,1175413,1175414,1175415,5040510,1175417,1175418,2137462,1175419,1175420,849307,1175421,1175422,894484],"posted_on":"2013-01-14T18:06:00+00:00","summary":"It seems like every time a male republican tries to talk about women, he somehow says something stupid and misogynistic.
