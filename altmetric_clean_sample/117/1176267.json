In healthy humans, hyperinsulinemia increases methionine transmethylation, homocysteine transsulfuration, and clearance. No such data exist in type 2 diabetes either in the fasting state or in response to hyperinsulinemia. To this purpose, seven male type 2 diabetic patients with albuminuria (1.2 +\/- 0.4 g\/day, three with mild to moderate renal insufficiency) and seven matched control subjects were infused for 6 h with L-[methyl-(2)H(3), 1-(13)C]methionine. Methionine flux, transmethylation, and disposal into proteins as well as homocysteine remethylation, transsulfuration, and clearance were determined before and after euglycemic hyperinsulinemia (approximately 1,000 pmol\/l). In type 2 diabetic subjects, homocysteine concentration was twofold greater (P < 0.01) and methionine transmethylation and homocysteine clearance lower (from approximately 15 to >50% and from approximately 40 to >100%, respectively; P < 0.05) than in control subjects. The insulin-induced increments of methionine transmethylation, homocysteine transsulfuration, and clearance were markedly reduced in type 2 diabetic subjects (by more than threefold, P < 0.05 or less vs. control subjects). In contrast, methionine methyl and carbon flux were not increased in the patients. In conclusion, pathways of homocysteine disposal are impaired in type 2 diabetes with nephropathy, both in postabsorptive and insulin-stimulated states, possibly accounting for the hyperhomocysteinemia of this condition.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026f7","authors":["Giacomo Garibotto"],"doi":"10.2337\/diabetes.54.10.2968","first_seen_on":"2013-01-15T08:33:15+00:00","issns":["1939-327X"],"journal":"Diabetes","last_mentioned_on":1358238427,"links":["http:\/\/diabetes.diabetesjournals.org\/content\/54\/10\/2968.short"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/diabetes.diabetesjournals.org\/content\/54\/10\/2968.full.pdf","pmid":"16186400","pubdate":"2005-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Effects of Insulin on Methionine and Homocysteine Kinetics in Type 2 Diabetes With Nephropathy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-insulin-methionine-homocysteine-kinetics-type-2-diabetes-nephropathy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3076985,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":955720,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":291919,"mean":5.9043194253181,"rank":198078,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":56279,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":291919,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3189,"mean":4.5674247176913,"rank":2330,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":620,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3189,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":426,"mean":5.7084141176471,"rank":320,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":78,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":426,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
