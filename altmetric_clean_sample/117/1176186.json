Standard statistical methods, such as the Cochrane-Armitage trend test or logistic regression, fail in this setting for the analysis of unrelated subjects because of the rareness of the variants. Recently, various alternative approaches have been proposed that circumvent the rareness problem by collapsing rare variants in a defined genetic region or sets of regions. We provide an overview of these collapsing methods for association analysis and discuss the use of permutation approaches for significance testing of the data-adaptive methods.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f61000751e","authors":["Dering C","Hemmelmann C","Pugh E","Ziegler A"],"doi":"10.1002\/gepi.20643","first_seen_on":"2013-01-15T06:11:25+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["0741-0395"],"issue":"","journal":"Genetic Epidemiology","last_mentioned_on":1358230075,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22128052"],"pmid":"22128052","pubdate":"2011-12-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["epidemiology","geneticsmedical"],"title":"Statistical analysis of rare sequence variants: an overview of collapsing methods.","type":"article","volume":"35 Suppl 1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/statistical-analysis-rare-sequence-variants-overview-collapsing-methods"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":3080149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":960776,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":291918,"mean":5.8954635941038,"rank":199730,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":57766,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":291918,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":327,"mean":1.865018404908,"rank":215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":67,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":327,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":2.0551666666667,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":10,"Researcher":33,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
