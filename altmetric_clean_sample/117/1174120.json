While the effects of cocaine are myriad, they are the result of a limited number of cocaine-protein interactions, including monoamine transporters, neurotransmitter receptors and voltage-gated ion channels. These primary interactions trigger a cascade of events that ultimately produce the clinical effects. The purpose of this article is to review the primary interactions of cocaine and the effects that these interactions trigger. We also describe the progression of symptoms observed in cocaine poisoning as they relate to serum cocaine concentrations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","authors":["Kennon Heard","Robert Palmer","Nancy R Zahniser"],"doi":"10.2174\/1874143600802010070","first_seen_on":"2013-01-14T05:05:53+00:00","issns":[""],"issue":"9","journal":"The open pharmacology journal","last_mentioned_on":1469665294,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2703432\/"],"pmcid":"PMC2703432","pmid":"19568322","pubdate":"2013-01-14T20:08:00+00:00","publisher":"NIH Public Access","startpage":"70","title":"Mechanisms of acute cocaine toxicity","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mechanisms-acute-cocaine-toxicity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
