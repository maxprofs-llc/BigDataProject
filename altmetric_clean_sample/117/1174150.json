Recent phase III trials revealed that new molecular-target agents, regorafenib and aflibercept, are useful for previously treated mCRC. Regorafenib is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor which targets angiogenic, stromal and oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase(RTK). Aflibercept is a recombinant fusion protein that consists of vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF)-binding portions from the extracellular domains of human VEGF receptors 1 and 2, fused to the Fc portion of the human IgG1 immunoglobulin. They are different in structure, but an anti-angiogenic effect is one of the main mechanisms of action they have in common. Consistent with the 18147ML study, bevacizumab beyond progression (BBP), anti-angiogenic therapies are important in any line of chemotherapy for colorectal cancer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9263cf058f61000dcf4","authors":["Kato S"],"first_seen_on":"2013-01-14T05:38:00+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"1","journal":"Gan to kagaku ryoho Cancer chemotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1358188193,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23306912?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23306912","pubdate":"2013-01-12T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms","antineoplasticagents"],"title":"[New molecular-targeted agents for colorectal cancer - regorafenib and aflibercept].","type":"article","volume":"40"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":2647511,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":2366447,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":288145,"mean":6.2090786481757,"rank":140834,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":145604,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":288145,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":597,"mean":0.60417785234899,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":535,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":597,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":0.35119047619048,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"NL":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/VEGFRSSfeeds\/statuses\/290694203615350785","license":"public","citation_ids":[1174150],"posted_on":"2013-01-14T05:37:53+00:00","author":{"name":"VEGF RSS Feeds","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/516588600\/VEGF_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"VEGFRSSfeeds","tweeter_id":"88511740","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":363},"tweet_id":"290694203615350785"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CorinCth\/statuses\/290888483755655168","license":"public","rt":["VEGFRSSfeeds"],"citation_ids":[1174150],"posted_on":"2013-01-14T18:29:53+00:00","author":{"name":"Corin ten Hoeven","url":"http:\/\/t.co\/hQYjt7kxuc","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3083304978\/a715deb499b1ae8ac97a7527bce9ea7b_normal.jpeg","description":"Brede interesses, oncologie, urologie, politiek, Israel etc..
