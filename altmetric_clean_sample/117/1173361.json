She had recurrent lung infections, due to earlier aspiration and immune deficiency (chronic granulomatous disease). Cytogenetic findings in this and other cases with suggestive phenotype may point to an additional locus for Brachmann-de Lange phenotype.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9023cf058f61000ca38","authors":["Mau, U A","Backsch, C","Schaudt, H","Trefz, F K","Kaiser, P"],"first_seen_on":"2013-01-13T16:05:13+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0148-7299"],"issue":"3","journal":"American Journal of Medical Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1358018951,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10756338"],"pmid":"10756338","pubdate":"2000-03-20T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Three-year-old girl with partial trisomy 4p and partial monosomy 8p with resemblance to Brachmann-de Lange syndrome--another locus for Brachmann-de Lange syndrome on 4p?","type":"article","volume":"91","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/threeyearold-girl-partial-trisomy-4p-partial-monosomy-8p-resemblance-brachmannde-lange-syndrome-anot"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3622323,"mean":4.9314823624217,"rank":2904917,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":72332,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3622323,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279789,"mean":5.7701241654397,"rank":223896,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":325,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279789,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":696,"mean":2.6381985611511,"rank":597,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":696,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
