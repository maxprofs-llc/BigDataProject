Various proposals have been put forward, which diverge especially in the specific kernel function, the type of input representation, and the feature sets. These proposals are regularly compared to each other regarding their overall performance on different gold standard corpora, but little is known about their respective performance on the instance level.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007a9","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2105-14-12","first_seen_on":"2013-01-16T12:06:54+00:00","issns":["1471-2105"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","last_mentioned_on":1358338008,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2105\/14\/12\/abstract"],"pmid":"23323857","pubdate":"2013-01-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Computer Science"],"startpage":"12","subjects":["computationalbiology"],"title":"A detailed error analysis of 13 kernel methods for protein-protein interaction extraction","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/open-access-detailed-error-analysis-13-kernel-methods-protein-protein-interaction-extraction"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629660,"mean":4.9331369641107,"rank":2900556,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":78413,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629660,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280263,"mean":5.7597152521569,"rank":223762,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":847,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280263,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2289,"mean":4.2657727272727,"rank":1997,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2289,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":142,"mean":5.0644822695035,"rank":124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":142,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
