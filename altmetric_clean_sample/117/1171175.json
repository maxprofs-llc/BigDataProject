It regulates the growth and differentiation of multiple cell types, and displays immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory properties. Cells involved in innate and adaptive immune responses--including macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells and B cells--express the vitamin D receptor (VDR), and can both produce and respond to 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). The net effect of the vitamin D system on the immune response is an enhancement of innate immunity coupled with multifaceted regulation of adaptive immunity. Epidemiological evidence indicates a significant association between vitamin D deficiency and an increased incidence of several autoimmune diseases, and clarification of the physiological role of endogenous VDR agonists in the regulation of autoimmune responses will guide the development of pharmacological VDR agonists for use in the clinic. The antiproliferative, prodifferentiative, antibacterial, immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties of synthetic VDR agonists could be exploited to treat a variety of autoimmune diseases, from rheumatoid arthritis to systemic lupus erythematosus, and possibly also multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel diseases, and autoimmune prostatitis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f610004274","authors":["Luciano Adorini","Giuseppe Penna"],"doi":"10.1038\/ncprheum0855","endpage":"412","first_seen_on":"2013-01-11T21:23:55+00:00","issns":["1759-4790","1759-4804","1745-8382","1745-8390"],"issue":"8","journal":"Nature Reviews Rheumatology","last_mentioned_on":1504609632,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nrrheum\/journal\/v4\/n8\/full\/ncprheum0855.html","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18594491"],"pmid":"18594491","pubdate":"2008-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"404","subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"Control of autoimmune diseases by the vitamin D endocrine system","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/control-autoimmune-diseases-vitamin-d-endocrine-system"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0.5,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366342,"mean":7.0541652571821,"rank":6049349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2017720,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366342,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":299857,"mean":6.9008322794941,"rank":189913,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":95839,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":299857,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1166,"mean":7.5715072961373,"rank":924,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":202,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1166,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":2.1937948717949,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":18,"Student  > Ph.
