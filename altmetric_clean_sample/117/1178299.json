It then presents selected research results of the experimental studies in vivo and in vitro which examine the biological effects of the emissions of cellular phones. The review of the epidemiologic evidence focuses in particular the epidemiologic studies on the use of cell phones and brain tumours, identifying some of the reasons of the conflicting results obtained. Studies dealing with the health risks involved in the increasing use of cellular phones by adolescents and children, more sensitive to this exposure, are also presented showing the need for special caution. The problem of hypersensitivity observed in some individuals is also briefly discussed. Finally the paper presents a summary of the main prevention measures necessary in order to reduce the risks in the framework of the \"precautionary principle\" including prevention policies and exposure limits in various countries.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a12","authors":["Talamanca IF","Giliberti C","Salerno S"],"first_seen_on":"2013-01-16T00:45:22+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"1","journal":"Annali Di Igiene","last_mentioned_on":1358297110,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22670334?dopt=Citation"],"pmid":"22670334","pubdate":"2012-06-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth","microbiology"],"title":"[Cell phones: health risks and prevention].","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cell-phones-health-risks-prevention"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627775,"mean":4.946368885166,"rank":2018045,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":933485,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627775,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280233,"mean":5.7733959933198,"rank":150511,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":79266,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280233,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":1.9428,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.4375,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
