Similar to lasers, the basic principle of IPL devices is a more or less selective thermal damage of the target. The combination of prescribed wavelengths, fluences, pulse durations, and pulse intervals facilitates the treatment of a wide spectrum of skin conditions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007fef","authors":["Babilas, Philipp","Schreml, Stephan","Szeimies, Rolf\u2010Markus","Landthaler, Michael"],"doi":"10.1002\/lsm.20877","endpage":"104","first_seen_on":"2013-01-14T19:01:02+00:00","issns":["1096-9101","0196-8092","10969101"],"issue":"2","journal":"Lasers in Surgery and Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1416952893,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/lsm.20877\/pdf","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20166155"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/lsm.20877\/pdf","pmid":"20166155","pubdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"93","subjects":["medicine","generalsurgery"],"title":"Intense pulsed light (IPL): a review.","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intense-pulsed-light-ipl-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4550001,"mean":5.3126583765574,"rank":866420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":3677066,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4550001,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284198,"mean":6.0696974774543,"rank":61853,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":221829,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284198,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":360,"mean":2.7035933147632,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":360,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":4.0748947368421,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
