The resulting complete pol II transcription preinitiation complex (PIC) contained equimolar amounts of all 31 protein components. An intermediate in assembly, consisting of four GTFs and promoter DNA, could be isolated and supplemented with the remaining components for formation of the PIC. Nuclease digestion and psoralen cross-linking mapped the PIC between positions -70 and -9, centered on the TATA box. Addition of ATP to the PIC resulted in quantitative conversion to an open complex, which retained all 31 proteins, contrary to expectation from previous studies. Addition of the remaining NTPs resulted in run-off transcription, with an efficiency that was promoter-dependent and was as great as 17.5% with the promoters tested.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m112.433623","first_seen_on":"2013-01-11T15:40:04+00:00","funders":["niaid","nigms"],"issns":["1083-351X"],"journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1369872000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23303183"],"pmid":"23303183","pubdate":"2013-01-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Formation and Fate of a Complete, 31-Protein, RNA polymerase II Transcription Initiation Complex.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/formation-fate-complete-31protein-rna-polymerase-ii-transcription-preinitiation-complex"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5098145,"mean":6.0405697540146,"rank":2693423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1740151,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5098145,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":288507,"mean":6.1988424018914,"rank":142129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":114496,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":288507,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27848,"mean":2.9715421409847,"rank":19656,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":4298,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27848,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1574,"mean":2.6529281627463,"rank":570,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":712,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1574,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
