On this basis, fits are made which recover very satisfactorily the variation of the distribution ratio as a function of [HNO(3)] for several experimental data sets from the literature. This chemical model is discussed and compared to another model.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Isabelle Billard","Ali Ouadi","Clotilde Gaillard"],"doi":"10.1039\/c3dt32159b","first_seen_on":"2013-01-16T17:53:38+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1477-9234","1477-9226"],"issue":"17","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1365019788,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2013\/DT\/C3DT32159B"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2013\/dt\/c3dt32159b","pmid":"23400599","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"6203","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Is a universal model to describe liquid\/liquid extraction of cations by use of ionic liquids at reach ?","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/universal-model-describe-liquidliquid-extraction-cations-ionic-liquids-reach"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":3546439,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":136099,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284858,"mean":5.9678294863739,"rank":228761,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1478,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284858,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7985,"mean":1.0186788577154,"rank":5254,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7985,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1610,"mean":1.1789620882536,"rank":1357,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1610,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
