We investigate the lipidome of lung pleural effusion (PE) for unique metabolic signatures to discriminate benign versus malignant PE and EGFR versus non-EGFR malignant subgroups to identify novel diagnostic markers that is independent of tumour cell availability. Using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, we profiled the lipidomes of the PE of 30 benign and 41 malignant cases with or without EGFR mutation. Unsupervised principal component analysis revealed distinctive differences between the lipidomes of benign and malignant PE as well as between EGFR mutants and non-EGFR mutants. Docosapentaenoic acid and Docosahexaenoic acid gave superior sensitivity and specificity for detecting NSCLC when used singly. Additionally, several 20- and 22- carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids and phospholipid species were significantly elevated in the EGFR mutants compared to non-EGFR mutants. A 7-lipid panel showed great promise in the stratification of EGFR from non-EGFR malignant PE. Our data revealed novel lipid candidate markers in the non-cellular fraction of PE that holds potential to aid the diagnosis of benign, EGFR mutation positive and negative NSCLC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Ying Swan Ho","Lian Yee Yip","Nurhidayah Basri","Vivian Su Hui Chong","Chin Chye Teo","Eddy Tan","Kah Ling Lim","Gek San Tan","Xulei Yang","Si Yong Yeo","Mariko Si Yue Koh","Anantham Devanand","Angela Takano","Eng Huat Tan","Daniel Shao Weng Tan","Tony Kiat Hon Lim"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep35110","first_seen_on":"2016-10-14T10:20:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1478288411,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep35110?utm_source=Technology+Algeria+News&utm_medium=Technology+Algeria+News&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+srep%2Frss%2Fcurrent+%28Scientific+Reports%29","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep35110?WT.ec_id=SREP-20161018&spMailingID=52555843&spUserID=MTYyNjAzNjc3MTY2S0&spJobID=1023467014&spReportId=MTAyMzQ2NzAxNAS2&utm_content=buffer3b358&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmid":"27739449","pubdate":"2016-10-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Non-small-cell lung cancer","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Diagnostic markers","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Lipidomic Profiling of Lung Pleural Effusion Identifies Unique Metabotype for EGFR Mutants in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lipidomic-profiling-lung-pleural-effusion-identifies-unique-metabotype-egfr-mutants-nonsmall-cell-lu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7644999,"mean":6.5733031223765,"rank":5510588,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1861758,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7644999,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242354,"mean":12.42016922423,"rank":156727,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":73469,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242354,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29855,"mean":14.916363502378,"rank":20710,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":7760,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29855,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3015,"mean":15.564318513603,"rank":2143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":773,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3015,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
