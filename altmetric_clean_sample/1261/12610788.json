Among all participants (combining groups), there were statistically significant declines from baseline observed for D-dimer, sCD163, and sTNFR-1 by week 12 and IL-6 by week 24. The proportion of participants with Lp-LA2 levels<200ng per mL (p=0.250) or hsCRP levels <3000mg per L (p=0.586) was unchanged through week 48.\nWe observed equivalent declines in biomarkers of monocyte activation and systemic inflammation in treatment-na\u00efve adults treated with TAF or TDF for 48weeks, suggesting that TAF and TDF have equivalent impact on immune activation and inflammation.","altmetric_jid":"544fc66b2a83ee03188b4567","authors":["Funderburg, Nicholas T","McComsey, Grace A","Kulkarni, Manjusha","Bannerman, Tammy","Mantini, Jessica","Thornton, Bernadette","Liu, Hui C","Zhang, Yafeng","Song, Qinghua","Fang, Liang","Dinoso, Jason","Cheng, Andrew","McCallister, Scott","Fordyce, Marshall W","Das, Moupali"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ebiom.2016.10.009","first_seen_on":"2016-10-14T09:35:40+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid"],"issns":["23523964","2352-3964"],"journal":"EBioMedicine","last_mentioned_on":1479208578,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S2352396416304649"],"pmid":"27742226","pubdate":"2016-10-16T22:02:38+00:00","title":"Equivalent Decline in Inflammation Markers with Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate vs. Tenofovir Alafenamide","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/equivalent-decline-inflammation-markers-tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate-vs-tenofovir-alafenamide"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7695823,"mean":6.6062009433119,"rank":3762674,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3736660,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7695823,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243157,"mean":12.433610603892,"rank":122876,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":111351,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243157,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":900,"mean":21.745724137931,"rank":696,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":900,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99,"mean":41.882673469388,"rank":73,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Mathematics":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/EBioMedicine\/statuses\/786862959293235200","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12610787,12610788],"posted_on":"2016-10-14T09:35:23+00:00","author":{"name":"EBioMedicine","url":"http:\/\/www.ebiomedicine.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/484030078804713472\/PQT21QCv_normal.jpeg","description":"Leading open access forum for basic and clinical biomedical research.
