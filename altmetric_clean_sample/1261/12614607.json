Previous research has suggested that early taste exposures could influence preferences and later eating behavior, but little is known about the factors related to this.\nThe aims of this study were to describe infants' exposure to sweetness and fattiness and to examine whether maternal and infant characteristics and feeding practices are related to these exposures in participants from the OPALINE [Observatoire des Pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences Alimentaires du Nourrisson et de l'Enfant (Observatory of Infant and Child Food Preferences)] cohort study.\nFood consumption frequency was assessed with a 7-d food record completed monthly over the first year. Dietary taste exposure was defined by the consumption frequency of each food multiplied by the intensity of its taste, summed over all foods. The daily sweetness exposure (SweetExp) and fattiness exposure (FatExp) were calculated at 3-6, 7-9, and 10-12 mo of age for 268 infants from complementary feeding initiation (CFI) to 12 mo. Associations between taste exposure and potential factors were tested by multiple linear regressions.\nBoth FatExp and SweetExp increased from 3-6 mo to 10-12 mo (mean \u00b1 SD: 7.5 \u00b1 2.3 to 12.2 \u00b1 2.5 and 6.8 \u00b1 2.8 to 14.7 \u00b1 4.1, respectively). Breastfeeding duration \u22656 mo was associated with higher SweetExp at all ages, with a decreasing \u03b2 [\u03b2 (95% CI): 2.6 (1.8; 3.4) at 3-6 mo and 1.3 (0.1; 2.4) at 10-12 mo]. CFI at <6 mo was associated with higher SweetExp at all ages but with higher FatExp only at 3-6 mo. Higher SweetExp and FatExp were associated with a higher use of all complementary food types. Boys were more likely to be exposed to SweetExp at 10-12 mo and to FatExp at 3-6 mo and 10-12 mo than were girls. Maternal higher education attainment and return to work after 6 mo were linked with higher FatExp and higher FatExp and SweetExp, respectively.\nSweetExp and FatExp increased from CFI until 12 mo and were associated with feeding practices in OPALINE infants. Studying early taste exposure longitudinally should provide new insights regarding the development of food preferences.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e8d","authors":["Wen Lun Yuan","Christine Lange","Camille Schwartz","Christophe Martin","Claire Chabanet","Blandine de Lauzon-Guillain","Sophie Nicklaus"],"doi":"10.3945\/jn.116.234005","first_seen_on":"2016-10-14T14:11:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1541-6100"],"issue":"11","journal":"Journal of Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1483150236,"links":["http:\/\/jn.nutrition.org\/content\/early\/2016\/10\/12\/jn.116.234005.abstract","http:\/\/jn.nutrition.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/146\/11\/2334?rss=1&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/jn.nutrition.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/146\/11\/2334?rss=1","http:\/\/jn.nutrition.org\/content\/146\/11\/2334.short?rss=1&utm_content=bufferabac8&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/jn.nutrition.org\/content\/early\/2016\/10\/12\/jn.116.234005.abstract?sid=483e1b7d-1595-415a-974d-25b8b380a737"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jn.nutrition.org\/content\/early\/2016\/10\/12\/jn.116.234005.full.pdf","pmid":"27733527","pubdate":"2016-10-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Infant Dietary Exposures to Sweetness and Fattiness Increase during the First Year of Life and Are Associated with Feeding Practices","type":"article","volume":"146","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/infant-dietary-exposures-sweetness-fattiness-increase-during-first-year-life-associated-feeding-prac"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.45,"score_history":{"1y":3.45,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7965219,"mean":6.7280072798953,"rank":1858217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6097331,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7965219,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246196,"mean":12.494336546233,"rank":78557,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":167034,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246196,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3828,"mean":13.050578521035,"rank":1629,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":2196,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3828,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90,"mean":47.241730337079,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":4,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Lecturer":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Sports and Recreations":1,"Psychology":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":5,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Environmental Science":2,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IE":1,"ES":1},"mendeley":{"CH":1,"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MaritaHennessy\/statuses\/786932492964098049","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12614607],"posted_on":"2016-10-14T14:11:41+00:00","author":{"name":"Marita Hennessy","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Marita_Hennessy","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/896056294246952972\/BEWpvdiE_normal.jpg","description":"@SPHeREprogramme PhD Scholar @hbcrg.
