The strains shared high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to Jeotgalicoccus pinnipedialis (98.6 %) but only \u226494% sequence similarity to all other Jeotgalicoccus species. DNA-DNA hybridisation values of strain 140805-STR-02T and J. pinnipedialis CIP 107946T were 60.3% (reciprocal, 51.2%). The quinone system of 140805-STR-02T contained predominantly menaquinone MK-7 and minor amounts of MK-6. The polar lipid profile of strain 140805-STR-02T contained the major compounds diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol and four unidentified lipids present in minor to moderate amounts. In the polyamine pattern spermidine and spermine were predominant. The fatty acid profile comprising iso C15:0 and anteiso C15:0 as major fatty acids was in congruence with those reported for other Jeotgalicoccus species and thus supported the affiliation of strain to this genus. The results of physiological and biochemical tests allowed a clear phenotypic differentiation of strain 140805-STR-02T from the most closely related species. Strain 140805-STR-02T represents a novel species, for which the names Jeotgalicoccus schoeneichii sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain 140805-STR-02T (= LMG 29445T = CCM 8667T).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079fb","authors":["Stefanie P.
