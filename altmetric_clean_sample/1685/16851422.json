Seven compounds were investigated: 4-aminophenylacetic acid, 4-aminophenethyl alcohol, 4-fluoroaniline, 4-(heptadecafluorooctyl)aniline, 4-aminoantipyrine, 4-(4-aminophenyl)butyric acid and 3,4,5-trimethoxyaniline. Quantitative monitoring of the electrodeposition process was carried out by electrogravimetry using quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). The electrodeposited mass varies between 26 ng\/cm\u00b2 for 4-fluoroaniline formed during 30 s to 442 ng\/cm\u00b2 for 4-phenylbutyric acid formed during 300 s. The corrosion inhibition properties of aryl-modified layers have been studied in buffer citrate with pH = 3 or 3.5% NaCl solutions using electrochemical noise (ECN) and Tafel potentiodynamic polarization measurements. A corrosion inhibiting efficiency up to 90% was found. The highest corrosion inhibition was obtained for 4-(4-aminophenyl)butyric acid and the lowest for 4-fluoroaniline. A relation between the inhibition efficiency and the chemical nature of the substituents in the protective layer was found.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f6100041bc","authors":["Ana Chira","Bogdan Bucur","Gabriel-Lucian Radu"],"doi":"10.3390\/ma10030235","first_seen_on":"2017-02-28T13:55:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1996-1944"],"issue":"3","journal":"Materials (1996-1944)","last_mentioned_on":1488290124,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1996-1944\/10\/3\/235?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1996-1944\/10\/3\/235\/pdf","pmid":"28772600","pubdate":"2017-02-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Electrodeposited Organic Layers Formed from Aryl Diazonium Salts for Inhibition of Copper Corrosion","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/electrodeposited-organic-layers-formed-aryl-diazonium-salts-inhibition-copper-corrosion"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8286032,"mean":6.9859461464656,"rank":7165332,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8286032,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241793,"mean":13.690962149285,"rank":201231,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241793,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1142,"mean":0.95373707274321,"rank":823,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1142,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":265,"mean":0.775,"rank":162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":265,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Chemistry":2,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/P_Doggy_Bone\/statuses\/836575534641360896","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16851422],"posted_on":"2017-02-28T13:55:24+00:00","author":{"name":"Precious Daniel\u2122","url":"http:\/\/facebook.com\/precious.ogunleye","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/891043583511470080\/FfBKDjay_normal.jpg","description":"All I want is to be RICH and FAMOUS through God's blessings.
