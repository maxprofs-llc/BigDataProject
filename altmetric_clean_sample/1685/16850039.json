To review the current literature regarding the management of head and neck NF. To determine the evidence for the role of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the management of NF.\nA retrospective audit of all patients admitted to the Royal Adelaide Hospital Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Unit 2006-2015 with severe odontogenic infections was carried out. Patient demographics were recorded and treatment details were collected and analysed.\nA total of 672 patients were admitted for management of severe odontogenic infections. Of these, three were identified as NF. One case was treated using hyperbaric oxygen as an adjunct to conventional surgical and medical management. Two cases were managed using aggressive surgical management alone. Two patients survived. The incidence of head and neck NF in South Australia is 48 per 100,000 infections per year.\nThe first line treatment of severe odontogenic infections remains conventional surgical and medical management, however hyperbaric oxygen therapy may have an additional role in the management of NF and other rare severe infections in medically complex patients.
