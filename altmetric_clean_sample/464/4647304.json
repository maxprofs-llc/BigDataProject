Although these solutions have been marketed for use in children, there are no data in this patient population. The objective of this study was to review our use of commercial premixed PN solutions in children.\nThis was a retrospective review of patients \u226418 years of age who received a premixed PN solution from October 2010 to April 2012. All premixed PN courses were assessed for incidence of premixed PN discontinuation due to laboratory abnormalities. Estimated goal and actual protein and total caloric intake were evaluated for premixed PN courses that were continued for >48 hours.\nSixty-nine patients received 74 courses of premixed PN solutions for a mean duration of 5.6 \u00b1 6.2 (range, 1-31) days. Fifteen courses (20%) required discontinuation of premixed PN as a result of mild laboratory abnormalities. No changes in clinical status were observed in patients and all abnormalities were corrected after switching to individualized PN. In patients receiving PN for >48 hours, premixed PN solutions provided goal protein in 48\/49 (98%) courses and goal calories in 33\/49 (67%) courses.\nPremixed PN solutions were used in a wide range of pediatric patients and provide a potential option for PN support in pediatric patients when drug shortages limit PN product supply. Close monitoring for electrolyte abnormalities and protein and caloric intake is recommended when using premixed PN solutions in children.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8203cf058f61000bc55","authors":["Chhim, Rebecca F","Crill, Catherine M"],"doi":"10.5863\/1551-6776-20.5.378","first_seen_on":"2015-10-19T14:02:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1551-6776"],"issue":"5","journal":"The Journal of Pediatric Pharmacology and Therapeutics : JPPT","last_mentioned_on":1445263084,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26472952"],"pmid":"26472952","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Premixed Parenteral Nutrition Solution Use in Children.","type":"article","volume":"20"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6335899,"mean":5.977107861901,"rank":4682094,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":943084,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6335899,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":198450,"mean":10.342171278263,"rank":134750,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":42737,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":198450,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":137,"mean":2.6496176470588,"rank":110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":137,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.575,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AcademiaGoFIR\/statuses\/656107047935565825","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4647304],"posted_on":"2015-10-19T13:58:04+00:00","author":{"name":"GoFIR","url":"http:\/\/www.academiagofir.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/459859717519462400\/J-m_jMKS_normal.png","description":"Academia FIR GoFIR: M\u00e1quina de conseguir aprobados FIR ! ! !
