In the absence of a clear phenotypic aetiology, recurrence risk estimates are often based on family segregation and may be imprecise. We profiled by oligonucleotide array-CGH patients presenting non-syndromic hearing loss with presumptive autosomal recessive (n\u2009=\u200950) or autosomal dominant (n\u2009=\u200950) patterns of inheritance. Rare copy number variants (CNVs) were detected in 12 probands; four of the detected CNVs comprised genes previously associated with hearing loss (POU4F3, EYA4, USH2A, BCAP31) and were considered causative, stressing the contribution of genomic imbalance to non-syndromic deafness. In six cases, segregation of the CNVs in pedigrees excluded them as causative. In one case, segregation could not be investigated, while in another case, a point mutation likely explains the phenotype. These findings show that the presumptive patterns of inheritance were incorrect in at least two cases, thereby impacting genetic counselling. In addition, we report the first duplication reciprocal to the rare ABCD1, BCAP31, and SLC6A8 contiguous deletion syndrome; as with most microduplication syndromes, the associated phenotype is much milder than the respective microdeletion and, in this case, was restricted to hearing impairment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002559","authors":["Rosenberg, Carla","Freitas, \u00c9rika L.","Uehara, Daniela T.","Auricchio, Maria Teresa B.
