Liy-Wong C, Pope E, Lara-Corrales I."],"citation":{"abstract":"Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) generally appears after puberty, is infrequently seen in younger children, and early onset, which is associated with more widespread disease, is more common in children with a positive family history of HS. When compared with adults with HS, children with HS are more likely to have hormonal imbalances, making hormonal investigations integral to disease management in pediatric patients. HS affects intertriginous areas, presenting with double-ended comedones, tender subcutaneous nodules, purulent discharge, and the formation of sinus tracts, hypertrophic fibrotic scars, and dermal contractures. Treatment of HS in children has not been well studied. The goals of therapy in the pediatric setting are to alleviate pain, minimize inflammation and scarring, prevent disease progression, and postpone the need for surgery. Mild cases can be treated with topical antibiotics, while topical and oral antibiotics are the primary therapies for moderate forms of HS. Modalities like biologic agents, laser therapy, or surgery have been reserved for severe pediatric cases of HS. Early recognition and treatment are critical to minimize the effects of the disease on the life course. Given the significant impact of the condition on quality of life and self-esteem, there is a clear role for psychological support.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e8d","authors":["Liy-Wong, Carmen","Pope, Elena","Lara-Corrales, Irene"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jaad.2015.07.051","endpage":"S41","first_seen_on":"2015-10-19T07:00:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1097-6787","01909622"],"issue":"5 Suppl 1","journal":"Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1469584793,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26470613","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26470613?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jaad.2015.07.051"],"pmid":"26470613","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"S36","subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Hidradenitis suppurativa in the pediatric population.","type":"article","volume":"73","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hidradenitis-suppurativa-pediatric-population-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8137857,"mean":6.8794880300098,"rank":4317659,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2253095,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8137857,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245467,"mean":9.6786330326806,"rank":128145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":91950,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245467,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3432,"mean":7.6118379481201,"rank":2224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":647,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3432,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":14.333114754098,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
