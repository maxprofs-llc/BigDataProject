Here, we report outcomes of choice and no-choice laboratory bioassays quantifying the rates of spotted wing drosophila alightment on 5-cm-diameter sticky disks of various colors, but no fruit odors. Red, purple, and black disks captured the most spotted wing drosophila when presented against a white background. Male and female spotted wing drosophila responded identically in these tests. Significantly more D. suzukii were captured on the red and yellow disks than those presenting the corresponding grayscale for that color, proving that D. suzukii perceives colors and not just the level of target brightness. Fluorescent red is the best candidate for trap color, while clear and white are the least desirable. However, when the background was switched to black, all nonfluorescent colors were equally acceptable to spotted wing drosophila, suggesting that background must be specified when reporting spotted wing drosophila color preference. Additional spotted wing drosophila research is justified on the effects of target color against natural backgrounds.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f610006523","authors":["Kirkpatrick, D M","McGhee, P S","Hermann, S L","Gut, L J","Miller, J R"],"doi":"10.1093\/ee\/nvv155","first_seen_on":"2015-10-19T09:51:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1938-2936"],"journal":"Environmental Entomology","last_mentioned_on":1445163068,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26475826?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26475826","pubdate":"2015-10-19T22:00:20+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Alightment of Spotted Wing Drosophila (Diptera: Drosophilidae) on Odorless Disks Varying in Color.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alightment-spotted-wing-drosophila-diptera-drosophilidae-odorless-disks-varying-color"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6311249,"mean":5.9753431809371,"rank":2774475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3369560,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6311249,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":198260,"mean":10.340231898678,"rank":95352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":94361,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":198260,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":605,"mean":2.8642317880795,"rank":261,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":317,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":605,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":1.5175,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
