Most of the data is from the West or Japan and retrospective, with good patient outcome.\nThis study was carried out from April 2011 to July 2013. We report a prospective follow-up of 11 patients who presented with renal dysfunction and had histological diagnosis of IgG4TIN followed for a minimum period of 1\u00a0year or until end-stage renal disease.\nIgG4TIN constituted 0.28% of total renal biopsies and 6.5% of all tubulointerstitial nephritis. Patient ages ranged between 21 and 71\u00a0years with a male predominance. All the patients had renal dysfunction at presentation with a mean serum creatinine of 5.12\u00a0mg\/dL. Proteinuria was subnephrotic except when there was coexisting membranous glomerulonephritis (36.4%). The mean 24-h urine protien excretion was 1.8\u00a0g. Serum IgG4 levels were elevated in 10 (90.9%) patients. Ten (90.9%) patients had renomegaly and one (9.1%) had focal renal mass. Extra-renal manifestations were present in seven (63.6%). Renal histology showed pattern A in five (45.5%), pattern B in four (36.3%) and pattern C in two (18.1%) patients. All but one patient (90.9%) received immunosuppressive therapy. Four (36.3%) achieved complete remission and three (27.2%) progressed to end stage renal disease. Two patients died due to infections while on steroid therapy. One patient with a mass had end stage renal disease for 12\u00a0months and did not improve with steroid therapy, and one (pattern C) had progressive chronic kidney disease on follow-up.\nIgG4TIN in an Indian cohort most often presents with rapidly progressive renal failure and less often has extra-renal organ involvement. On follow-up, patients can experience a more aggressive course with progression to end stage renal disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b9b","authors":["Nada, Ritambhra","Ramachandran, Raja","Kumar, Ashwani","Rathi, Manish","Rawat, Amit","Joshi, Kusum","Kohli, Harbir Singh","Gupta, Krishan Lal"],"doi":"10.1111\/1756-185x.12675","first_seen_on":"2015-10-18T01:20:02+00:00","issns":["1756-185X"],"journal":"International Journal of Rheumatic Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1445061728,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26355389"],"pmid":"26355389","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"IgG4-related tubulointerstitial nephritis: A prospective analysis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/igg4related-tubulointerstitial-nephritis-prospective-analysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6278272,"mean":5.9867156995941,"rank":2953144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1874309,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6278272,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197321,"mean":10.303710399351,"rank":104673,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":72381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197321,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275,"mean":2.6970583941606,"rank":102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":144,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":4.4814285714286,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
