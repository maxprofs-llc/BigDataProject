Recently, some studies suggested that this effect was mediated by antagonizing CB1 receptors in hepatic stellate cells. The current study aimed to investigate whether CB1 antagonist, hemopressin, could potentiate the hepatoprotective effect of curcumin, in comparison with silymarin in bile duct-ligated (BDL) rats. Curcumin and hemopressin each alone and in combination ameliorated biochemical and structural fibrotic injury, and downregulated cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and both mRNA and protein levels of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) in fibrotic liver. In contrast to the previous studies, curcumin alone did not affect the gene expression of cannabinoid receptors. However, the combination of hemopressin and curcumin reduced the expression of CB1 in fibrotic liver. Surprisingly, silymarin upregulated CB2 receptors and downregulated CB1 at mRNA level more than all the administered drugs. Both curcumin and hemopressin each alone decreased lipid peroxidation product, malondialdehyde (MDA), while the combination increased the reduced glutathione content. All the administered drugs increased the hepatic antiapoptotic marker, Bcl2. Our study suggests that hemopressin potentiates the hepatoprotective effect of curcumin on fibrotic liver. We identified a new mechanism of the hepatoprotective effect of silymarin via modulation of cannabinoid receptors in fibrotic liver.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008264","authors":["El Swefy, Sahar","Hasan, Rehab A","Ibrahim, Amal","Mahmoud, Mona F"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00210-015-1181-7","first_seen_on":"2015-10-19T09:47:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-1912"],"journal":"Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1445165013,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26475620?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26475620","pubdate":"2015-10-19T22:00:23+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology\/Toxicology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Curcumin and hemopressin treatment attenuates cholestasis-induced liver fibrosis in rats: role of CB1 receptors.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/curcumin-hemopressin-treatment-attenuates-cholestasisinduced-liver-fibrosis-rats-role-cb1-receptors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6311249,"mean":5.9753431809371,"rank":5370067,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6311249,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":198260,"mean":10.340240221125,"rank":155516,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":198260,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":398,"mean":2.4303727959698,"rank":317,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":398,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.92,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
