The remarkable reactivity of RPSB in the visual pigment rhodopsin has been attributed to potential energy surface modifications enabled by evolution-optimized chromophore-protein interactions. Here, we use a combined synthetic and ultrafast spectroscopic approach to show that barrierless photoisomerization is an intrinsic property of 11-cis RPSB, suggesting that the protein merely adjusts the ratio between fast reactive and slow unreactive decay channels. These results call for a reevaluation of our understanding and theoretical description of RPSB photochemistry.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Giovanni Bassolino"],"doi":"10.1021\/jacs.5b06492","first_seen_on":"2015-10-17T23:46:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-5126"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1445101419,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/full\/10.1021\/jacs.5b06492"],"pmid":"26376448","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Barrierless Photoisomerization of 11-cis Retinal Protonated Schiff Base in Solution","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/barrierless-photoisomerization-11cis-retinal-protonated-schiff-base-solution"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6278272,"mean":5.9867156995941,"rank":4642509,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":940314,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6278272,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196868,"mean":10.309329323858,"rank":133738,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":42314,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196868,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16379,"mean":4.8873834412016,"rank":13296,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":1991,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16379,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":198,"mean":7.2468324873096,"rank":159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":198,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
