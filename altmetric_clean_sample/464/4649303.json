Speech pathologists who manage patients with dysphagia are frequently required to address ethical issues when patients' food culture and\/ or preferences are inconsistent with recommended diets. These issues incorporate complex links between food, identity and social participation. A composite case has been developed to reflect ethical issues identified by practising speech pathologists for the purposes of illustrating ethical concerns in dysphagia management. The case examines a speech pathologist's role in supporting patient autonomy when patients and carers express different goals and values. The case presents a 68-year-old man of Australian\/Italian heritage with severe swallowing impairment and strong values attached to food preferences. The case is examined through application of the dysphagia algorithm, a tool for shared decision-making when patients refuse dietary modifications. Case analysis revealed the benefits and challenges of shared decision-making processes in dysphagia management. Four health professional skills and attributes were identified as synonymous with shared decision making: communication, imagination, courage and reflection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023cc","authors":["Kenny, Belinda"],"doi":"10.1111\/bioe.12189","endpage":"652","first_seen_on":"2015-10-20T09:51:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1467-8519"],"issue":"9","journal":"Bioethics","last_mentioned_on":1449940107,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/bioe.12189&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/bioe.12189","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/enhanced\/doi\/10.1111\/bioe.12189?hootPostID=32227ce9568a35d9ce7802a5925a9a1c"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/bioe.12189\/pdf","pmid":"26481206","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Ethics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Philosophy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"646","subjects":["ethics"],"title":"Food Culture, Preferences and Ethics in Dysphagia Management","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/food-culture-preferences-ethics-dysphagia-management"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6978080,"mean":6.2371484971698,"rank":2527016,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4429582,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6978080,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238113,"mean":9.3922651021368,"rank":76296,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":160536,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238113,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":569,"mean":5.1427746478873,"rank":246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":318,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":569,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":4.63,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
