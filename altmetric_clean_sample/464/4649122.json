However, little is known about the narrative abilities of bilingual preschool children with SLI and their patterns of growth.\nTo determine the similarities and differences in narrative abilities between preschoolers with and without SLI who are either monolingual or bilingual at two time points.\nForty children completed a narrative retell task in English at two test points. The mean ages were 52 and 58 months at Times 1 and 2, respectively. We examined performance on measures of narrative macrostructure (narrative information) and microstructure (sentence length, number of different words, verb accuracy, first mentions) in monolingual and bilingual children with and without SLI. The bilingual children were from diverse first-language backgrounds and all spoke English most of the time.\nA series of repeated-measures analyses of variance was used with language ability (typical development or SLI) and bilingual status (monolingual versus bilingual) as the between-subjects factors and time (Times 1 or 2) as the within-subjects factor. Results indicated a significant main effect of time for four measures (i.e., Information Score, lexical diversity, sentence length and verb accuracy). The between-subjects analyses indicated a significant difference between the typically developing children and the children with SLI in all measures and a significant difference between monolingual and bilingual children for verb accuracy only.\nThis study showed that all four groups of children showed growth over a 6-month period and that bilingual children exposed predominantly to English in the home performed similarly to their monolingual peers in measures of narrative information, sentence length, number of different words and first mentions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b67","authors":["Rezzonico, Stefano","Chen, Xi","Cleave, Patricia L.","Greenberg, Janice","Hipfner\u2010Boucher, Kathleen","Johnson, Carla J.","Milburn, Trelani","Pelletier, Janette","Weitzman, Elaine","Girolametto, Luigi"],"doi":"10.1111\/1460-6984.12179","endpage":"841","first_seen_on":"2015-10-20T09:42:58+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1460-6984"],"issue":"6","journal":"International Journal of Language & Communication Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1445335194,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1460-6984.12179\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1460-6984.12179\/pdf","pmid":"26215148","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Linguistics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"830","subjects":["speechlanguagepathology"],"title":"Oral narratives in monolingual and bilingual preschoolers with SLI","type":"article","volume":"50","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/oral-narratives-monolingual-bilingual-preschoolers-sli"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6496972,"mean":6.0160896500841,"rank":3074681,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1942493,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6496972,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208437,"mean":10.166412673434,"rank":111507,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":75740,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208437,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":434,"mean":6.2914919168591,"rank":340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":434,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":7.8807692307692,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
