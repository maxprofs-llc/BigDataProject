Zebrafish E-selectin cDNA is 3146 bp and encodes a putative 871 amino acid protein. All structural domains involved in E-selectin function are conserved in the putative protein. Whole-mount in situ hybridization of zebrafish at 24 and 48 h post-fertilization (hpf) revealed E-selectin expression mainly in vascular\/endothelial progenitor cells in the posterior trunk and blood cells in the intermediate cell mass and posterior cardinal vein regions. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis detected E-selectin expression at 0.2, 24 and 48 hpf and significantly decreased from 48 to 72 hpf. The expression of E-selectin, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-1\u03b2 was significantly upregulated at 22 to 72 h after induction with bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Thus, the structure of E-selectin protein is highly conserved among species, and E-selectin may be involved in embryonic development and essential for hematopoiesis and angiogenesis during embryonic development in zebrafish. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence of inflammatory mediators inducing E-selectin expression in non-mammalian vertebrates, which suggests that zebrafish E-selectin may be involved in inflammation and probably has similar biological function to mammalian E-selectin.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422e","authors":["Sun, Guijin","Liu, Kechun","Wang, Xue","Liu, Xiuhe","He, Qiuxia","Hsiao, Chung-Der"],"doi":"10.3390\/molecules201018539","first_seen_on":"2015-10-18T00:45:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1420-3049"],"issue":"10","journal":"Molecules","last_mentioned_on":1445078462,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26473817?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26473817","pubdate":"2015-10-18T22:01:10+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Identification and Expression Analysis of Zebrafish (Danio rerio) E-Selectin during Embryonic Development.","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-expression-analysis-zebrafish-danio-rerio-eselectin-during-embryonic-development"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6278272,"mean":5.9867156995941,"rank":5338232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6278272,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197320,"mean":10.303770979987,"rank":154829,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197320,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2577,"mean":2.1644549689441,"rank":1524,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2577,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":188,"mean":1.0527165775401,"rank":128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":188,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HSC_papers\/statuses\/655332686567882752","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4642329],"posted_on":"2015-10-17T10:41:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Hematopoiesis","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/618441198634561537\/Y2u99HYj_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"HSC_papers","tweeter_id":"3271095818","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":88},"tweet_id":"655332686567882752"}]}}
