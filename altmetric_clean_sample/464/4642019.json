Extended mastoidotympanectomy was performed on two cases, with subtotal temporal bone resection on 12 cases and temporal bone resection on four cases. The patients who had cervical metastasis underwent additional radical neck resection and post-operative radiotherapy at the neck. The patients were followed-up after surgery.\nDuring the follow-up, no cases of T1 recurred, and six cases of T2 or T3 recurred, with the total recurrence rate of 37.5% among the patients of T2 and T3. At the fifth year after surgery, 15 patients were still alive, and the actual 5-year survival rate was 83.3% among all patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5173cf058f610003806","authors":["Feng, Lichun","Jin, Aiyan","Dai, Baoqiang","Li, Yanping","Guo, Yusheng","Wang, Daowen","Xu, Peng"],"doi":"10.3109\/00016489.2015.1094825","first_seen_on":"2015-10-18T00:31:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1651-2251"],"journal":"Acta Oto-Laryngologica","last_mentioned_on":1445084672,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26472473?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26472473","pubdate":"2015-10-18T22:01:38+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"Outcomes of 18 cases with squamous cell carcinoma of middle ear who underwent both surgery and post-operative radiotherapy.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/outcomes-18-cases-squamous-cell-carcinoma-middle-ear-underwent-both-surgery-postoperative-radiothera"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6278272,"mean":5.9867156995941,"rank":2953152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1874316,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6278272,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197320,"mean":10.303757549957,"rank":104671,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":72383,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197320,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":745,"mean":1.9769650537634,"rank":279,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":174,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":745,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":1.1859375,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OTO_docs\/statuses\/655358734755999744","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4642019],"posted_on":"2015-10-17T12:24:32+00:00","author":{"name":"OTOdocs","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/451475015045615617\/pvQ7oTD5_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Otolaryngology papers in #PubMed and #arXiv.","id_on_source":"OTO_docs","tweeter_id":"2424371810","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":388},"tweet_id":"655358734755999744"}]}}
