We recruited: 1) regular officers, 2) officers wanting to join a specialized arrest unit (expected to possess more stress-resistant traits; pre-AU), and 3) officers from this unit (expected to also possess more professional experience; AU) (all male). In Phase 1 we determined personality traits and experience. In Phase 2 state anxiety, shot accuracy, decision-making (shoot\/don't shoot), movement speed and gaze behaviour were measured while officers performed a shooting test under low and high pressure. Results indicate minimal differences in personality among groups and superior performance of AU officers. Regression analyses showed that state anxiety and shooting performance under high pressure were first predicted by AU experience and second by certain personality traits. Results suggest that although personality traits attenuate the impact of high pressure, it is relevant experience that secures effective performance under pressure.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d73cf058f610001232","authors":["Annemarie Landman"],"doi":"10.1080\/00140139.2015.1107625","first_seen_on":"2015-10-19T08:24:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1366-5847"],"journal":"Ergonomics","last_mentioned_on":1449156934,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/00140139.2015.1107625","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/eprint\/miSRknfRWnmiVyBBgNCh\/full","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/00140139.2015.1107625"],"pmid":"26467525","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Design Practice And Management","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"The impact of personality traits and professional experience on police officers\u2019 shooting performance under pressure","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-personality-traits-professional-experience-police-officers-shooting-performance-under-pressur"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6644977,"mean":6.1548448788946,"rank":1125865,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":5513412,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6644977,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238000,"mean":9.3340862188495,"rank":50614,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":187078,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238000,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":780,"mean":4.4535712451861,"rank":118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":661,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":780,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":2.6134615384615,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":4,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
