One of the mechanisms underlying this process is the expression of so-called stress-inducible immunostimulating ligands. Although the activating receptor NKG2D has been proven to play roles in tumor therapy through targeting its ligands, the role of NKp30, another key activating receptor, is seldom addressed. In this study, we found that the NKp30 ligand B7-H6 was widely expressed in tumor cells and closely correlated to their susceptibility to NK cell lysis. Further studies showed that treatment of tumor cells with almost all standard tumor therapeutics, including chemotherapy (cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil), radiation therapy, non-lethal heat shock, and cytokine therapy (TNF-\u03b1), could upregulate the expression of B7-H6 in tumor cells and enhance tumor sensitivity to NK cell cytolysis. B7-H6 shRNA treatment effectively dampened sensitization of tumor cells to NK-mediated lysis. Our study not only reveals the possibility that tumor therapeutics work as stress inducers to enhance tumor sensitivity to NK cell cytolysis but also suggests that B7-H6 could be a potential target for tumor therapy in the future.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Cao, Guoshuai","Wang, Jian","Zheng, Xiaodong","Wei, Haiming","Tian, Zhigang","Sun, Rui"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m115.674010","first_seen_on":"2015-10-17T23:56:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1083-351X"],"journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1462971850,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26472927?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26472927?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26472927","pubdate":"2015-10-18T22:01:28+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Tumor therapeutics work as stress inducers to enhance tumor sensitivity to NK cell cytolysis by upregulating NKp30 ligand B7-H6.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tumor-therapeutics-work-stress-inducers-enhance-tumor-sensitivity-natural-killer-nk-cell-cytolysis-u"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7684314,"mean":6.5948576928038,"rank":2936323,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4723007,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7684314,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242427,"mean":9.4657848003102,"rank":77035,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":163959,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242427,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30561,"mean":3.1916455497382,"rank":19284,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":11219,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30561,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":411,"mean":4.8789073170732,"rank":118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":411,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
