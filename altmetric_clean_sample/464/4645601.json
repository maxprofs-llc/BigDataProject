We assessed mortality rates and predictors of death among 12,222 non-pregnant ART-na\u00efve adults initiating first-line ART between 04\/2004-05\/2012 in South Africa, stratified by person-years in care and lost. We found 14.6% of patients died and being lost accounted for a minority of deaths across multiple definitions of loss (population attributable-risk percent ranged from 10.4-42.5%). Although mortality rates in patients lost were much higher than in care, most ART-related mortality occurred on treatment.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives License 4.0 (CC BY-NC-ND), which permits downloading and sharing the work provided it is properly cited.
