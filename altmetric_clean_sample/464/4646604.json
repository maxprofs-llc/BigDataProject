Representative strains of 16 bacterial genotypes (S1-S16) selected from more than 400\u00a0L.\u00a0garvieae isolates were used to induce lysogenic bacteriophages. These strains were treated with 500\u00a0ng\u00a0mL(-1) freshly prepared mitomycin C. A cross-spotting assay was performed to validate the lysogenic and indicator strains. The lysogenic strains were selected for isolation and concentration of the phages. Phage DNA was digested with EcoRI for biased sinusoidal field gel electrophoresis analysis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect integrated prophage DNA. Of the 16 representative bacterial genotypes, 12 strains integrated prophages as indicated by the PCR assay, and 10 phages were detected and isolated using two indicator bacterial strains. Analysis of genomic DNA showed that these phages were homologous and named as PLgT-1. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the morphology of PLgT-1 was consistent with the virus family Siphoviridae. PCR analysis of the prophage DNA revealed that all of the S1 genotype strains were lysogenic (30\/30), but none of the S16 genotype strains were lysogenic (0\/30). This is the first study to investigate lysogenic bacteriophages from L.\u00a0garvieae.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f43cf058f610002daa","authors":["Hoai, T D","Yoshida, T"],"doi":"10.1111\/jfd.12410","first_seen_on":"2015-10-19T10:22:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1365-2761"],"journal":"Journal of Fish Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1445153583,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26471724?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26471724","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Fisheries Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Induction and characterization of a lysogenic bacteriophage of Lactococcus garvieae isolated from marine fish species.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/induction-characterization-lysogenic-bacteriophage-lactococcus-garvieae-isolated-marine-fish-species"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6311249,"mean":5.9753431809371,"rank":5370052,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6311249,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":198260,"mean":10.340231898678,"rank":155514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":198260,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261,"mean":3.4765461538462,"rank":183,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":3.10275,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
