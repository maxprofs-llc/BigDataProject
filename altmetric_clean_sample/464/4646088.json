The dominant genetic effect is located on chromosome 6p21.3 within the major histocompatibility complex region, accounting for one-third of genetic contribution. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified additional genes, including skin barrier function, innate immune response, and adaptive immune response genes. To better understand disease susceptibility and progression requires replication in larger cohorts, fine-mapping efforts, new technologies, and functional studies of genetic variants, gene-gene interactions and gene-environmental interactions. New technologies available include next-generation sequencing, copy number variation analysis, and epigenetics.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005cb4","authors":["O'Rielly, Darren D","Rahman, Proton"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.rdc.2015.07.002","first_seen_on":"2015-10-19T09:48:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1558-3163"],"issue":"4","journal":"Rheumatic Disease Clinics of North America","last_mentioned_on":1473702632,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26476223?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26476223?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26476223","pubdate":"2015-10-19T22:00:12+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"Genetic, Epigenetic and Pharmacogenetic Aspects of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis.","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genetic-epigenetic-pharmacogenetic-aspects-psoriasis-psoriatic-arthritis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366012,"mean":7.0543497525808,"rank":3849199,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4433020,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366012,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":247973,"mean":9.6895611278692,"rank":100773,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":142709,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":247973,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177,"mean":2.1797159090909,"rank":83,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":92,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
