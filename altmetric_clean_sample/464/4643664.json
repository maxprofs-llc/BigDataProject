These constituents cocrystallize in a 1:1 stoichiometry, [Ni(NCS)2(C7H7N)4]\u00b7C6F4I2, in the tetragonal space group I41\/a. Both residues occupy special positions, i.e. the pseudo-octahedral Ni(II) complex is located on a twofold axis and the TFDIB molecule sits about a crystallographic centre of inversion. The components interact via a short S...I contact of 3.2891\u2005(12)\u2005\u00c5 between the thiocyanate S atom of the host and the iodine substituent at the perhalogenated aromatic ring of the smaller guest molecule. This interaction meets the commonly accepted criteria for a halogen bond. Such halogen bonds to sulfur are significantly less common than to smaller electronegative atoms.","authors":["\u015eerb, M.-D.","Merkens, C.","Kalf, I.","Englert, U.","\u015eerb, Mihaela\u2010Diana","Merkens, Carina","Kalf, Irmgard","Englert, Ulli"],"doi":"10.1107\/s2053229615019002","endpage":"995","first_seen_on":"2015-10-18T02:07:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["2053-2296"],"issue":"Pt 11","journal":"Acta Crystallographica Section C: Structural Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1448467895,"links":["http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?S2053229615019002","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1107\/S2053229615019002&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.iucr.org\/c\/issues\/2015\/11\/00\/yp3107\/yp3107.pdf","pmid":"26524173","pubdate":"2015-10-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"International Union of Crystallography","startpage":"991","title":"Halogen bonds on demand: I...S contacts in cocrystals of trans\u2010bis(thiocyanato\u2010\u03baN)tetrakis(4\u2010vinylpyridine\u2010\u03baN)nickel(II) and 2,3,5,6\u2010tetrafluoro\u20101,4\u2010diiodobenzene","type":"article","volume":"71","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/halogen-bonds-demand-contacts-cocrystals-transbisthiocyanato%CE%BAntetrakis4vinylpyridine%CE%BAnnickelii-2356t"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Ph.
