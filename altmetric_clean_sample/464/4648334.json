However, the Tumor Node Metastasis (TNM) staging system for colorectal cancer does not consider it as a prognostic parameter. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the prognostic role of ENE in patients with lymph node positive colorectal cancer.\nTwo independent authors searched PubMed and SCOPUS until 07\/01\/2015 without language restrictions. Prospective studies reporting data on prognostic parameters in subjects with colorectal cancer, comparing participants with presence of ENE (ENE+) vs. only intra-nodal extension (ENE-) were eligible. Data were summarized using risk ratios (RR) for number of deaths\/recurrences and hazard ratios (HR) together with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for time-dependent risk related to ENE+, adjusted for potential confounders.\nThirteen studies including 1,336 patients were identified with a median follow up of 4.7 years. ENE was associated with a higher T stage and tumor grading. In addition, ENE was associated with a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality (RR= 1.75; 95%CI: 1.42-2.16, p<0.0001, I(2)=60%; HR=1.69, 95%CI: 1.32-2.17, p<0.0001, I(2)=46%) and of recurrence of disease (RR=2.07, 95%CI: 1.65-2.61, p<0.0001, I(2)=47%; HR=2.31, 95%CI: 1.54-3.44, p<0.0001, I(2)=48%).\nOn the basis of these results, in colorectal cancer, ENE should be considered from the gross sampling to the pathology report, as well as in future oncologic staging systems.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002280","authors":["N.
