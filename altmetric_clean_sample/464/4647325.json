Examination disclosed hypopyon and vitritis, as well as discrete inflammatory collections in the vitreous and widespread retinal hemorrhages. The patient underwent vitrectomy with injection of intravitreal antibiotics. Vitreous cultures were positive for Streptococcus mitis, a pathogen associated with severe tissue damage and poor clinical outcomes. Clinical deterioration prompted repeat vitrectomy with silicone oil tamponade and panretinal photocoagulation two weeks later, resulting in more favorable anatomic and visual outcomes. Endophthalmitis caused by exotoxin-producing bacterial species such as S. mitis is often associated with severe vision loss or loss of the eye. Aggressive surgical intervention - prompted by concerning clinical findings and vitreous cultures - may play a role in improving outcomes in these patients.
