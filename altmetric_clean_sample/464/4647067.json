Despite high 20-year overall survival (81.0 %), progression-free and endocrine event-free (EEFS) survival were 47.2 % and 20.8 % respectively. EEFS declined up to 15 years post-diagnosis, with hypothalamic involvement (p<0.001) being implicated more than radiotherapy (p=0.008) in earlier endocrinopathy; the reverse being true of its density (radiotherapy p<0.001; hypothalamic involvement p=0.006). GH deficiency (GHD) was commonest (40.3 %), followed by central precocious puberty (CPP, 26.0 %), gonadotropin (GnD, 20.4 %), TSH (13.3 %), and ACTH (13.3 %) deficiencies. GHD increased with later treatment eras (p<0.01), but replacement did not increase progression. CPP was associated with future GnD (p<0.05). Posterior pituitary dysfunction (PPD, 7.2 %) occurred in 57.9 % after only biopsies or shunt procedures, and was associated with 6\/13 deaths. 50.2 % became obese. Tumor extent, surgery and increased endocrinopathy, rather than radiotherapy, predicted visuo-cognitive morbidity.\nThis first longitudinal OP\/HSG-specific study demonstrates that hypothalamo-pituitary dysfunction evolves hierarchically over decades. Tumor location predicts its speed of onset and radiotherapy its density. GnD can evolve from previous CPP, whilst life-threatening PPD can occur after any surgery. Our data suggest that recent radiation-avoiding chemotherapeutic strategies have increased GHD without improving survival.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be1","authors":["Gan, H-W","Hoong-Wei Gan"],"doi":"10.1210\/jc.2015-2028","first_seen_on":"2015-10-19T12:33:36+00:00","issns":["1945-7197","0021-972X"],"issue":"10","journal":"The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1468321255,"links":["http:\/\/discovery.ucl.ac.uk\/1471668\/","http:\/\/press.endocrine.org\/doi\/full\/10.1210\/jc.2015-2028"],"pmid":"26218754","pubdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","endocrinology"],"title":"Neuroendocrine morbidity after pediatric optic gliomas: a longitudinal analysis of 166 children over 30 years","type":"article","volume":"100","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neuroendocrine-morbidity-after-pediatric-optic-gliomas-longitudinal-analysis-166-children-30-years"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8069135,"mean":6.8476973499224,"rank":5843926,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1939256,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8069135,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245388,"mean":9.6744446038298,"rank":153716,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":75666,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245388,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6856,"mean":8.1325943107221,"rank":5490,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":1194,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6856,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85,"mean":18.805595238095,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
