Recent studies also suggest a critical role of IRAKs in tumor development, though the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Pelle is the sole Drosophila IRAK homolog implicated in the conserved Toll pathway that regulates Dorsal\/Ventral patterning, innate immune response, muscle development and axon guidance. Here we report a novel function of pll in modulating apoptotic cell death, which is independent of the Toll pathway. We found that loss of pll results in reduced size in wing tissue, which is caused by a reduction in cell number but not cell size. Depletion of pll up-regulates the transcription of pro-apoptotic genes, and triggers caspase activation and cell death. The transcription factor dFoxO is required for loss-of-pll induced cell death. Furthermore, loss of pll activates dFoxO, promotes its translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus, and up-regulates the transcription of its target gene Thor\/4E-BP. Finally, Pll physically interacts with dFoxO and phosphorylates dFoxO directly. This study not only identifies a previously unknown physiological function of pll in cell death, but also shed light on the mechanism of IRAKs in cell survival\/death during tumorigenesis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000334a","authors":["Wu, Chenxi","Chen, Yujun","Wang, Feng","Chen, Changyan","Zhang, Shiping","Li, Chaojie","Li, Wenzhe","Wu, Shian","Xue, Lei"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pgen.1005589","first_seen_on":"2015-10-18T00:41:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1553-7404"],"issue":"10","journal":"PLoS Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1462066353,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26474173?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosgenetics\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pgen.1005589"],"pmid":"26474173","pubdate":"2015-10-18T22:01:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Pelle Modulates dFoxO-Mediated Cell Death in Drosophila","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pelle-modulates-dfoxomediated-cell-death-drosophila"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7632130,"mean":6.5668397124796,"rank":1693117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":5926945,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7632130,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242527,"mean":9.4632833180772,"rank":64160,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":177679,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242527,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5147,"mean":12.117241352507,"rank":2416,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":2710,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5147,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201,"mean":11.89668,"rank":110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":91,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
