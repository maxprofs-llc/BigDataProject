Participants were 363 students from a large public university in the Midwest who reported at least one binge-drinking episode (5+\/4+ drinks for men\/women in one sitting) in the past 30 days. Data were collected 1\/2010-3\/2011. We used SEM to test models where protective behavioral strategies (PBS) and social norms were predictors of both alcohol use and alcohol-related problems, after controlling for the effects of gender. Both PBS and descriptive norms had relationships with alcohol use. PBS also had a relationship with alcohol-related problems. Overall, the findings suggest that PBS and social norms have unique associations with distinct alcohol-related outcomes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5173cf058f61000381e","authors":["Brooke J.
