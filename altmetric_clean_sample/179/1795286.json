Under the optimized conditions (50% acetonitrile in processed samples, 35% of diphenyl content of the TRB, capillary length 43cm and water:methanol 60:40 as replacing solvent), the extraction efficiency was similar for all the homologues with satisfactory reproducibility and independently of the amount and proportion of homologues. Industrial samples with high viscosity or with complex composition and washes waters have been analyzed without previous treatment. The coupling of IT-SPME-CapLC-DAD to MS detection allowed the determination of the minority homologues (C16 and C18) in the industrial samples and washes waters. No matrix effect was found.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cf6","authors":["M.C. Prieto-Blanco","Y. Moliner-Martinez","P.
