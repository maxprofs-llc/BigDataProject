Evidence of the cytotoxicity of Cameroonian plants against cancer cell lines including MDR phenotypes is been intensively and progressively provided. The present work was therefore designed to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the methanol extracts of twenty-two Cameroonian medicinal plants against sensitive and MDR cancer cell lines.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b0","doi":"10.1186\/1472-6882-13-250","first_seen_on":"2013-10-03T06:23:42+00:00","issns":["1472-6882"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1380787131,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6882\/13\/250\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1472-6882-13-250.pdf","pmid":"24088184","pubdate":"2013-10-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"250","subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"Cytotoxicity of Elaoephorbia drupifera and other Cameroonian medicinal plants against drug sensitive and multidrug resistant cancer cells","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cytotoxicity-15-cameroonian-medicinal-plants-against-drug-sensitive-multidrug-resistant-cancer-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2303275,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1598483,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99422,"mean":7.7513809758504,"rank":49475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":35215,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99422,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1452,"mean":4.8388159889731,"rank":854,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":408,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1452,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":3.50045,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
