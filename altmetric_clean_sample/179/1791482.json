Such studies present important ethical challenges. An increasing number of GWAS is taking place in lower income countries and there is a pressing need to identify the particular ethical challenges arising in such contexts. In this paper, we draw upon the experiences of the MalariaGEN Consortium to identify specific ethical issues raised by such research in Africa, Asia and Oceania.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007c0","authors":["Jantina de Vries","Susan J Bull","Ogobara Doumbo","Muntaser Ibrahim","Odile Mercereau-Puijalon","Dominic Kwiatkowski","Michael Parker"],"doi":"10.1186\/1472-6939-12-5","first_seen_on":"2013-09-30T10:02:41+00:00","funders":["wellcome","mrc"],"issns":["1472-6939",""],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Medical Ethics","last_mentioned_on":1480912380,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6939\/12\/5","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6939\/12\/5?utm_content=buffer8fe2b&utm_source=buffer&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Buffer","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3076260"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1472-6939-12-5.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3076260","pmid":"21418562","pubdate":"2011-03-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ethics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Philosophy","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Philosophy of Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Theory of Medicine\/Bioethics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Applied Ethics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Nursing","Social Sciences"],"startpage":"5","subjects":["ethics"],"title":"Ethical issues in human genomics research in developing countries","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ethical-issues-human-genomics-research-developing-countries-7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.75,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7849747,"mean":6.6509658923939,"rank":1538375,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6304727,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7849747,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138318,"mean":7.01962081306,"rank":28051,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":110118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138318,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":393,"mean":8.2542653061225,"rank":152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":393,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":3.675,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
