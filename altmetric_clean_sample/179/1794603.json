Historically, research has examined cognitive vulnerabilities to BSDs derived largely from the unipolar depression literature. Specifically, theorists propose that dysfunctional information processing guided by negative self-schemata may be a risk factor for depression. However, few studies have examined whether BSD individuals also show self-referent processing biases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c6c","authors":["Ashleigh Molz Adams","Benjamin G Shapero","Laura H Pendergast","Lauren B Alloy","Lyn Y Abramson"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jad.2013.07.039","first_seen_on":"2013-10-01T10:17:44+00:00","issns":["1573-2517"],"journal":"Journal of Affective Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1380622611,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24074480?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24074480","pubdate":"2013-08-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Self-referent information processing in individuals with bipolar spectrum disorders.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/selfreferent-information-processing-individuals-bipolar-spectrum-disorders"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633617,"mean":4.9215564192856,"rank":2897778,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":82233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633617,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93307,"mean":7.6233055323347,"rank":73825,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":440,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93307,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2082,"mean":4.2330264296012,"rank":1677,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2082,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":5.6419772727273,"rank":66,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
