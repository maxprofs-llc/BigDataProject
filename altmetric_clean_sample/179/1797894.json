One of the reasons that have been discussed for the failure of vaccination to eliminate the disease is continued circulation of the pathogen Bordetella pertussis by mostly asymptomatic and mild infections in adolescents and adults. To understand the impact of asymptomatic and undiagnosed infection on the transmission dynamics of pertussis we analysed serological data from five European countries in combination with information about social contact patterns from five of those countries to estimate incidence and reproduction numbers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000334b","authors":["Mirjam Kretzschmar","Peter F M Teunis","Richard G Pebody","Peter F.
