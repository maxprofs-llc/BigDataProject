According to a recent study, PNP was significantly less frequent with subcutaneous administration of Btz. Here, we report our experience regarding the efficacy and tolerability of standard combination regimens in MM with subcutaneous Btz.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005bdb","authors":["W Lamm","B Drach-Schauer","S Eder","J Drach"],"doi":"10.1159\/000355197","first_seen_on":"2013-10-02T11:55:40+00:00","issns":["1423-0232"],"issue":"4","journal":"Oncology (08909091)","last_mentioned_on":1381529862,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24080991","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24080991?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24080991","pubdate":"2013-09-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Bortezomib Administered Subcutaneously Is Well Tolerated in Bortezomib-Based Combination Regimens Used in Patients with Multiple Myeloma.","type":"article","volume":"85","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bortezomib-administered-subcutaneously-tolerated-bortezomibbased-combination-regimens-used-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":3350168,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1481421,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104536,"mean":7.8908765293923,"rank":66185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":34459,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104536,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":551,"mean":1.5041781818182,"rank":233,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":288,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":551,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":0.59375,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
