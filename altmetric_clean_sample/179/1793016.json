Algorithms in medicine: The profession must realise that if they do not do anything it will be done for them."],"citation":{"abstract":"The ever rising costs of health care in Western countries necessitate some form of cost control. Restrictions can be and will be imposed externally by, for instance, the government. These measures will probably lead to a decrease in quality of health care and the profession should therefore seek ways to prevent outside interference by developing an internal means of cost control. On short terms a form of internal control with preservation of the quality of care would be the introduction and widespread use of algorithms, restricting the use of useless and unnecessary tests and therapies. For long term results education must take on new tasks leading to a better understanding of costs an benefits of medical activities. The development of algorithms is hindered by the lack of common consensus of optimal care, the lack of relevant data and the inefficient way data are managed. When introduced the algorithm, especially when compulsory, will engender much resistance and unhappily, ways must be found to overcome them by sanctions. The profession must realise that if they do not do anything it will be done for them.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f6100058aa","authors":["H N Greeo","P A van Gelder"],"first_seen_on":"2013-09-30T23:25:20+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0167-871X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Effective Health Care","last_mentioned_on":1380583507,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10299859"],"pmid":"10299859","pubdate":"1984-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Algorithms in medicine.","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/algorithms-medicine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627916,"mean":4.9454584244709,"rank":2017883,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":933942,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627916,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92820,"mean":7.6375024725543,"rank":48445,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":24587,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92820,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":5.048,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/aDoktorAsa\/status\/384821237283045376","license":"public","citation_ids":[1793016],"posted_on":"2013-09-30T23:25:07+00:00","author":{"name":"\u00c5sa Wihlbeck","url":"http:\/\/se.linkedin.com\/pub\/\u00e5sa-wihlbeck\/6a\/3a0\/2b3\/","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000621907386\/12bafc77f22322dfcb7a59bea136e1ab_normal.jpeg","description":"Empowering Patients to Give Them the Health Care They Need. http:\/\/www.wihlbeck.com","id_on_source":"aDoktorAsa","tweeter_id":"1037415206","geo":{"lt":"38.0091199337357","ln":"-122.116837106443","country":"US"},"followers":10204},"tweet_id":"384821237283045376"}]}}
