A case-control survey among Swedish patients was performed at Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital to identify risk factors for developing an infection with ESBL-producing Escherichia coli in a low endemic country.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8203cf058f61000bc28","authors":["Johan Tham","Inga Odenholt","Mats Walder","Lina Andersson","Eva Melander"],"doi":"10.2147\/idr.s46290","first_seen_on":"2013-10-03T06:39:44+00:00","issns":["1178-6973"],"journal":"Infection and Drug Resistance","last_mentioned_on":1380782347,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24082789?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24082789","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Risk factors for infections with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli in a county of Southern Sweden.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/risk-factors-infections-extendedspectrum-betalactamaseproducing-escherichia-coli-county-southern-swe"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628172,"mean":4.9437236464363,"rank":2904444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628172,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93401,"mean":7.6597098715205,"rank":74138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":254,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93401,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":3.3313725490196,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":2.12,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
