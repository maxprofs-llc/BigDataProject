Currently, little is known about the molecular pathogenesis and no direct genotype-phenotype relationship has yet been confirmed. Since DS amniocytes are expected to have a distinct biological behaviour compared to normal amniocytes, we hypothesize that relative quantification of proteins produced from trisomy and euploid (chromosomally normal) amniocytes will reveal dysregulated molecular pathways.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007fd","doi":"10.1186\/1559-0275-10-2","first_seen_on":"2013-10-01T15:12:56+00:00","issns":["1559-0275"],"issue":"1","journal":"Clinical Proteomics","last_mentioned_on":1380640384,"links":["http:\/\/www.clinicalproteomicsjournal.com\/content\/10\/1\/2"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.clinicalproteomicsjournal.com\/content\/pdf\/1559-0275-10-2.pdf","pmid":"23394617","pubdate":"2013-02-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pathology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Proteomics","scheme":"springer"}],"startpage":"2","title":"Quantitative proteomic analysis of amniocytes reveals potentially dysregulated molecular networks in Down syndrome","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quantitative-proteomic-analysis-amniocytes-reveals-potentially-dysregulated-molecular-networks-down"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506935,"mean":5.125739366827,"rank":2319213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1558362,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506935,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99111,"mean":7.7442011704169,"rank":49927,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":33567,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99111,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":2.7408,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":2.7,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
