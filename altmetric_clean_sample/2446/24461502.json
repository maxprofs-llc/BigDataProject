Cancer cells are the driving force of tumor development and progression. Yet, cancer cells are unable to accomplish this alone. The tumor microenvironment is also considered to play an active role rather than simply acting as a by-stander in tumor progression. Through different pathways, tumor cells efficiently recruit stromal cells, which in turn, provide tumor cell growth signals, intermediate metabolites, and provide a suitable environment for tumor progression as well as metastasis. Through reciprocal communication, cancer cells and the microenvironment act in collusion leading to high proliferation and metastatic capability. Understanding the role of the tumor microenvironment in tumor progression provides us with novel approaches through which to target the tumor microenvironment for efficient anticancer treatment. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms involved in the recruitment of stromal cells by tumor cells to the primary tumor site and highlight the role of the tumor microenvironment in the regulation of tumor progression. We further discuss the potential approaches for cancer therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f61000837e","authors":["YAO YUAN","YU-CHEN JIANG","CHONG-KUI SUN","QIAN-MING CHEN"],"doi":"10.3892\/or.2016.4660","first_seen_on":"2017-08-29T07:17:52+00:00","issns":["1021-335X","1791-2431"],"journal":"Oncology Reports","last_mentioned_on":1503532800,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3892\/or.2016.4660"],"pmid":"26986034","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Role of the tumor microenvironment in tumor progression and the clinical applications (Review)","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-tumor-microenvironment-tumor-progression-clinical-applications-review-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":4496254,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2344247,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":157096,"mean":12.465559540405,"rank":85487,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":55764,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":157096,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1640,"mean":1.6444966442953,"rank":434,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":1031,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1640,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":0.425,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
