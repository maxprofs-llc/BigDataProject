Up to now, the effect of BCG vaccination on antibody responses to host proteins has not been reported. High-content peptide microarrays (HCPM) offer a unique opportunity to gauge specific humoral immune responses.\nWe tested sera of BCG-vaccinated healthy adults on a human HCPM platform (4953 randomly selected epitopes of human proteins) to detect specific immunoglobulin gamma (IgG) responses. Samples were obtained after 56, 112 and 252days of vaccination, respectively. Immunohistology was performed on lymph node tissue from patients with TB lymphadenitis. Results were analysed with a combination of existing and novel statistical methods.\nIgG recognition of host peptides exhibited a peak at day 56 post BCG vaccination in all tested study subjects, which diminished over time. Primarily, IgG responses exhibited increased reactivity to ion transporters (sodium, calcium channels), cytokine receptors (IL2R\u03b2, FGFR1), other cell surface receptors (inositol, somatostatin, angiopoeitin), ribonucleoprotein and enzymes (tyrosine kinases, phospholipase) on day 56. There was decreased IgG reactivity to TGF\u03b2R1 and in agreement with the peptide microarray findings; immunohistochemical analysis of TB infected lymph node samples revealed an overexpression of TGF\u03b2R in granulomatous lesions. Moreover, the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) showed increased reactivity on days 112 and 252, but not on day 56 post-vaccination. IgG to IL-4R showed increased reactivity 112days post vaccination, while IgG to IL2R\u03b2 and FGFR1 showed decreased reactivity on 112 and 252days as compared to day 56 post BCG vaccination, compared to day 56.\nBCG vaccination modifies the host's immune landscape after 56 days, but this imprint changes over time. This may influence the establishment of immunological memory in BCG vaccinated individuals.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000c89","authors":["Davide Valentini","Martin Rao","Lalit Rane","Sayma Rahman","Rebecca Axelsson-Robertson","Rainer Heuchel","Matthias L\u00f6hr","Daniel Hoft","Susanna Brighenti","Alimuddin Zumla","Markus Maeurer"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijid.2017.01.027","first_seen_on":"2017-08-29T10:01:10+00:00","issns":["12019712"],"journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1504000834,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28161459?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28161459","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Peptide microarray-based characterization of antibody responses to host proteins after bacille Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin vaccination","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/peptide-microarraybased-characterization-antibody-responses-host-proteins-after-bacille-calmettegu%C3%A9r"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":7297880,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172011,"mean":12.479461915005,"rank":140529,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172011,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1318,"mean":5.1605117691724,"rank":1096,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1318,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":3.9405405405405,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
