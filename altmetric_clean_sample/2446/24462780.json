Among them, 80% had constitutional symptoms, especially weight loss and asthenia, and 60% had arthritis. Initially, all patients had at least one alteration in their blood count, lactate dehydrogenase was increased in 80% and a bone marrow smear was conclusive in 60% of patients. Bone and intestine biopsies were necessary for the diagnosis in 2 patients. JIA was the most common initial diagnosis. The definitive diagnosis was acute lymphoblastic leukemia (2 patients), M3 acute myeloid leukemia, lymphoma, and neuroblastoma (one case each). Of 5 patients studied, 3 (60%) are in remission and 2 (40%) died, one of them with prior use of steroids.\nThe constitutional and musculoskeletal symptoms common to rheumatic and neoplastic diseases can delay the diagnosis and consequently worsen the prognosis of neoplasms. Initial blood count and bone marrow smear may be normal in the initial framework of neoplasms. Thus, the clinical follow-up of these cases becomes imperative and the treatment, mainly with corticosteroids, should be delayed until diagnostic definition.","altmetric_jid":"537f30872a83eeb45a8b4652","authors":["Mariana Bertoldi Fonseca","Francisco Hugo Rodrigues Gomes","Elvis Terci Valera","Gecilmara Salviato Pileggi","Paula Braga Gonfiantini","Marcela Braga Gonfiantini","Virg\u00ednia Paes Leme Ferriani","Luciana Martins de Carvalho"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.rbre.2017.01.007","first_seen_on":"2017-08-29T08:11:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["22555021"],"issue":"4","journal":"Revista Brasileira de Reumatologia (English Edition)","last_mentioned_on":1503994253,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28743360?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28743360","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Signs and symptoms of rheumatic diseases as first manifestation of pediatric cancer: diagnosis and prognosis implications","type":"article","volume":"57","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/revista-brasileira-reumatologia-signs-symptoms-rheumatic-diseases-first-manifestation-pediatric-canc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":6408591,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1148398,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172011,"mean":12.479521213883,"rank":121702,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":31479,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172011,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":2.4425714285714,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":2.325,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/inbraced\/statuses\/902443424623853568","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24462780],"posted_on":"2017-08-29T08:10:53+00:00","author":{"name":"INBRACED","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/465146281568911360\/OW_wB0Bq_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"inbraced","tweeter_id":"2483933496","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":46},"tweet_id":"902443424623853568"}]}}
