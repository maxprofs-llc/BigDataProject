Here, we aim to establish a gene signature that can identify molecular pathways\/transcription factors involved in ovarian cancer progression, poor clinical outcome, and chemotherapy resistance. To validate the robustness of the gene signature, a meta-analysis approach was applied to 1,020 patients from 7 datasets. A 97-gene signature was identified as an independent predictor of patient survival in association with other clinicopathological factors in univariate [hazard ratio (HR): 3.0, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.66-5.44, p\u2009=\u20092.7E-4] and multivariate [HR: 2.88, 95% CI 1.57-5.2, p\u2009=\u20090.001] analyses. Subset analyses demonstrated that the signature could predict patients who would attain complete or partial remission or no-response to first-line chemotherapy. Pathway analyses revealed that the signature was regulated by HIF1\u03b1 and TP53 and included nine HIF1\u03b1-regulated genes, which were highly expressed in non-responders and partial remission patients than in complete remission patients. We present the 97-gene signature as an accurate prognostic predictor of overall survival and chemoresponse. Our signature also provides information on potential candidate target genes for future treatment efforts in ovarian cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Abel Matondo","Yong Hwa Jo","Muhammad Shahid","Tae Gyu Choi","Minh Nam Nguyen","Ngoc Ngo Yen Nguyen","Salima Akter","Insug Kang","Joohun Ha","Chi Hoon Maeng","Si-Young Kim","Ju-seog Lee","Jayoung Kim","Sung Soo Kim"],"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-017-08766-5","first_seen_on":"2017-08-29T09:05:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2045-2322"],"issue":"1","journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1503997542,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-08766-5?WT.feed_name=subjects_cancer&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-08766-5.pdf","pmid":"28851888","pubdate":"2017-08-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","startpage":"9689","subjects":["science"],"title":"The Prognostic 97 Chemoresponse Gene Signature in Ovarian Cancer","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prognostic-97-chemoresponse-gene-signature-ovarian-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":7297881,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172011,"mean":12.479527318179,"rank":140531,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172011,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37752,"mean":14.755138565866,"rank":31367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37752,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3484,"mean":13.281778926213,"rank":2761,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3484,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ChpHealthcare\/statuses\/902457220222164992","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24464371],"posted_on":"2017-08-29T09:05:42+00:00","author":{"name":"ChpHealthcare.com","url":"http:\/\/www.chphealthcare.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/535842796460965888\/hR1KY45G_normal.png","id_on_source":"ChpHealthcare","tweeter_id":"2905419084","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":255},"tweet_id":"902457220222164992"}]}}
