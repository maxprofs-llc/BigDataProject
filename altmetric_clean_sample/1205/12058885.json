In this paper, we propose a novel lossless compression method to further reduce the size of a set of JPEG coded correlated images without any loss of information. The proposed method jointly removes inter\/intra image redundancy in the feature, spatial, and frequency domains. For each collection, we first organize the images into a pseudo video by minimizing the global prediction cost in the feature domain. We then present a hybrid disparity compensation method to better exploit both the global and local correlations among the images in the spatial domain. Furthermore, the redundancy between each compensated signal and the corresponding target image is adaptively reduced in the frequency domain. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed lossless compression method. Compared to the JPEG coded image collections, our method achieves average bit savings of more than 31%.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a5c","authors":["H. Wu","X. Sun","J. Yang","W. Zeng","F.
