There is also need for a complementary intervention to reduce the proportion of TOs associated with high loss to follow-up and non-evaluated TO rates.","authors":["Mfungwe, V."],"doi":"10.5588\/pha.16.0016","endpage":"121","first_seen_on":"2016-09-17T07:19:47+00:00","issns":["2220-8372","22208372"],"issue":"2","journal":"Public health action","last_mentioned_on":1473166240,"links":["http:\/\/www.ingentaconnect.com\/contentone\/iuatld\/pha\/2016\/00000006\/00000002\/art00013"],"pmcid":"PMC4913674","pmid":"27358805","pubdate":"2016-06-21T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"118","title":"\u2018Transfer out\u2019 tuberculosis patients: treatment outcomes after cross-checking registers, 2012\u20132013, Lusaka, Zambia","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transfer-tuberculosis-patients-treatment-outcomes-after-crosschecking-registers-20122013-lusaka-zamb"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Other":3,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"\u2018Transfer out\u2019 tuberculosis patients: treatment outco...: Ingenta Connect","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1780770018812561&id=1500679683488264","license":"public","citation_ids":[12054297],"posted_on":"2016-09-06T12:50:40+00:00","summary":"Affiliations: 1: Japan Anti-Tuberculosis Association\u2013Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia 2: Lusaka District Community Health Office, Lusaka, Zambia","author":{"name":"JATA Zambia","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/1500679683488264","facebook_wall_name":"JATA Zambia","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/1500679683488264\/picture","id_on_source":"1500679683488264"}}]}}
