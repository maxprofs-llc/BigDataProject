Here, we present a design for a titanium implantable chamber with transparent silicone artificial dura which enables two-photon calcium imaging in non-human primates. This chamber accommodates imaging with high numerical aperture multiphoton objective lenses, and remains sealed, protecting the brain from the surrounding environment. In addition, we describe a tunable tissue stabilization system to apply gentle mechanical pressure to stabilize tissue during imaging. Our results suggest that two-photon calcium imaging may soon facilitate a new class of circuit and systems neuroscience experiments in non-human primates.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9253cf058f61000dc6b","authors":["E.
