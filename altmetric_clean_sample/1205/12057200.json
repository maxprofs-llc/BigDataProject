This reality is one of the tremendous victories for decades of research in computer engineering, computer science, electronics, and communications.

Digital data are recorded in different forms and at unprecedented scales. Examples include database tables in every business entity; Tweets; e-mails and text documents; audio and speech signals; seismic data (recorded as temporal multidimensional tensors); video data (possibly stored with other modalities such as audio and captions); graphs representing relations and interactions among different entities (links among web documents, users on social networks, devices on computer networks, or gene interaction networks); and images, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and more.
