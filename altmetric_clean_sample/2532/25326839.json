For most RTKs, however, it is not known whether they can exploit this new signaling mechanism or not. Here we used a system-wide screen to address the frequency of susceptibility to gamma-secretase cleavage among human RTKs. The screen covering 45 of the 55 human RTKs identified 12 new as well as all 9 previously published gamma-secretase substrates. The screen was biochemically validated by demonstrating that the release of a soluble intracellular fragment from endogenous AXL was dependent on the sheddase ADAM10 and the gamma-secretase component presenilin-1. Functional analysis of the cleavable RTKs indicated that proliferation promoted by overexpression of the TAM family members AXL or TYRO3 was dependent on gamma-secretase cleavage. Taken together, these data indicate that gamma-secretase-mediated cleavage provides an additional signaling mechanism for numerous human RTKs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c7","authors":["Johannes A.
