The probability of losing alignment according to the EWC was dichotomized (likely to lose alignment \u22650.5 vs. unlikely <0.5).\nAccuracy parameters of prediction of EO, MR and EWC RESULTS:: EWC and MR demonstrated higher accuracy (0.77 and 0.75, respectively) and sensitivity (0.95 and 0.79, respectively) compared to expert opinion (accuracy 0.66, sensitivity 0.58) for predicting healing above threshold malalignment. Reliability was higher for MR (kappa 0.88) than for EWC (kappa 0.63) or EO (kappa coefficient 0.44). The negative predictive value of the EWC for healing above a threshold of malalignment was excellent (0.97).\nSurgeon opinion is not reliable or accurate for predicting loss of alignment of a distal radius fracture above a threshold malalignment after closed reduction and immobilization. Dichotomized EWC may be a useful tool in predicting loss of alignment (instability) of a distal radius fracture.\nDiagnostic Level II.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a82","authors":["Toni Luokkala","Tapio Flinkkil\u00e4","Juha Paloneva","Teemu V Karjalaine"],"doi":"10.1097\/bot.0000000000001022","first_seen_on":"2017-09-15T10:21:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0890-5339","1531-2291"],"journal":"Journal of orthopaedic trauma","last_mentioned_on":1505470823,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28906304?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28906304","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Comparison of Expert Opinion, Majority Rule, and a Clinical Prediction Rule to Estimate Distal Radius Malalignment","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":7275610,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128509,"mean":11.755642948299,"rank":104433,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128509,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1844,"mean":3.0374139989148,"rank":1600,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1844,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":3.7,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/pmidcalc\/statuses\/908636607695278082","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25326920],"posted_on":"2017-09-15T10:20:23+00:00","author":{"name":"pmidCALC","url":"http:\/\/www.pmidcalc.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/532077188288221184\/tjo8N6V9_normal.png","description":"Keep up to date with the latest scoring systems that will impact your practice.We also support @evidencio_org project.
