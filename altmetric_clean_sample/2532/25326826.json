Numerous plant sources have been widely studied to reduce virulence of pathogenic bacteria by interfering cell-to-cell based communication called quorum sensing (QS). Leaf extracts of 17 gardening trees were collected and investigated for their anti-QS effects using a sensor strain Chromobacterium violaceum CV026. Methanolic extracts of K4 (Acer palmatum), K9 (Acer pseudosieboldianum) and K13 (Cercis chinensis) leaves were selected for further experiments based on their antagonism effect on QS without inhibiting C. violaceum CV026 growth. Subsequently, the leaf extracts on QS-mediated virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 involved in biofilm formation, motility, bioluminescence, pyocyanin production, QS molecules production, and Caenorhabditis elegans killing activity were evaluated. The biofilm formation ability and swarming motility of P. aeruginosa PAO1 were decreased approximately 50% in the presence of these leaf extracts at a concentration of 1\u00a0mg\/mL. The expression level of lecA::lux of P. aeruginosa PAO1 and pyocyanin production were also reduced. The three leaf extracts also decreased autoinducer (AI) production in P. aeruginosa PAO1 without direct degradation, suggesting that AI synthesis might have been suppressed by these extracts. The three leaf extracts also showed anti-infection activity in C. elegans model. Taken together, these results suggest that methanolic leaf extracts of K4, K9 and K13 have the potential to attenuate the virulence of P. aeruginosa PAO1.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f610007753","authors":["Kaimin Niu","Min Kuk","Haein Jung","Kokgan Chan","Sooki Kim"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12088-017-0660-6","first_seen_on":"2017-09-15T10:19:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0046-8991","0973-7715"],"issue":"3","journal":"Indian Journal of Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1505488968,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28904418?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC5574778","pmid":"28904418","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Leaf Extracts of Selected Gardening Trees Can Attenuate Quorum Sensing and Pathogenicity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1","type":"article","volume":"57"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.75,"6m":1.75,"3m":1.75,"1m":1.75,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418954,"mean":7.0848786337124,"rank":3878719,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4455777,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418954,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128513,"mean":11.755526441111,"rank":53967,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":72437,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128513,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":136,"mean":1.4387259259259,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":136,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":2,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/QSPapers\/statuses\/908636030261010432","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25326826],"posted_on":"2017-09-15T10:18:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Quorum Sensing","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507853503956402176\/VuBr1wau_normal.jpeg","description":"Tweetbot serving the world by providing links to the latest published papers on bacterial quorum sensing.
