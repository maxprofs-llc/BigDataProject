However, evidence on burden of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia in Japan is limited. This prospective, observational, multicenter, physician practice-based cohort study was conducted in Kushiro, Hokkaido, Japan (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01873365) to assess the incidence and hospitalization rates of herpes zoster, and the proportion, clinical burden and risk factors for postherpetic neuralgia in adults aged 60 years or more. Within the study area, 800 subjects developed herpes zoster and 412 were eligible for the study. Herpes zoster incidence was 10.2\/1000 person-years and higher among women and older subjects. Subjects with herpes zoster required on average 5.7 outpatient consultations. Herpes zoster-associated hospitalization rate was 3.4% (27\/800). The proportion of postherpetic neuralgia and other complications was 9.2% (38\/412) and 26.5% (109\/412), respectively. Statistically significant association with the development of postherpetic neuralgia was male sex (odds ratio [OR], 2.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-5.38), age of 70-74 years (OR, 3.51; 95% CI, 1.09-11.3), immunosuppressive therapy (OR, 6.44; 95% CI, 1.26-32.9), severe herpes zoster pain at first consultation (OR, 3.08; 95% CI, 1.10-8.62) and rash on upper arms (vs no rash on upper arms; OR, 3.46; 95% CI, 1.10-10.9). Considerable herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia burden exists among elderly in Japan, and there may be predictive factors at the first visit which could be indicative of the risk of developing postherpetic neuralgia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c37","authors":["Keiko Sato","Koichi Adachi","Hiroyuki Nakamura","Kazuhiro Asano","Akihiro Watanabe","Riri Adachi","Mariko Kiuchi","Keiju Kobayashi","Taizo Matsuki","Toshihiko Kaise","Kusuma Gopala","Katsiaryna Holl"],"doi":"10.1111\/1346-8138.13639","first_seen_on":"2017-09-15T10:32:34+00:00","issns":["03852407"],"journal":"The Journal of Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1505471533,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27917531?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27917531","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Burden of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia in Japanese adults 60 years of age or older: Results from an observational, prospective, physician practice-based cohort study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/burden-herpes-zoster-postherpetic-neuralgia-japanese-adults-60-years-age-older-results-observational"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":4496261,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2344249,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128510,"mean":11.755553416492,"rank":69358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":46006,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128510,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":718,"mean":2.7324184100418,"rank":276,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":319,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":718,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.6,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
