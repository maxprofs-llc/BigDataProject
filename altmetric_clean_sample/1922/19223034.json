Lack of medical coverage in Africa leads to inappropriate care that has an impact on the mortality rate. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the cost of severe acute sickle-cell related complications in Brazzaville. Methods. A retrospective study was conducted in 2014 in the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit. It concerned 94 homozygote sickle-cell children that developed severe acute sickle-cell disease related complications (average age 69 months). For each patient, we calculated the cost of care complication. Results. The household income was estimated as low (<XAF 90,000\/<USD 158.40) in 27.7%. The overall median cost for hospitalization for sickle-cell related acute complications was XAF 65,460\/USD 115.21. Costs were fluctuating depending on the generating factors of the severe acute complications (p = 0.041). They were higher in case of complications generated by bacterial infections (ranging from XAF 66,765\/USD 117.50 to XAF 135,271.50\/USD 238.07) and lower in case of complications associated with malaria (ranging from XAF 28,305\/49.82 to XAF 64,891.63\/USD 114.21). The mortality rate was 17% and was associated with the cost of the case management (p = 0.006). Conclusion. The case management cost of severe acute complications of sickle-cell disease in children is high in Congo.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51a3cf058f6100038bc","authors":["Ngolet, L.
