The two enantiomers of the compound (E)-\u03b1-ionone from raspberry flavor were separated on a chiral gas chromatographic column. Based on the ratio of these two enantiomers, the naturalness of a raspberry flavor can be evaluated due to the fact that a natural flavor will consist almost exclusively of the R enantiomer, while a chemical synthesis of the same compound will result in a racemic mixture. Twenty-seven food products containing raspberry flavors where investigated using SPME-chiral-GC-MS. We found raspberry jam, dried raspberries, and sodas declared to contain natural aroma all contained almost only R-(E)-\u03b1-ionone supporting the content of natural raspberry aroma. Six out of eight sweets tested did not indicate a content of natural aroma on the labeling which was in agreement with the almost equal distribution of the R and S isomer. Two products were labeled to contain natural raspberry flavors but were found to contain almost equal amounts of both enantiomers indicating a presence of synthetic raspberry flavors only. Additionally, two products that were labeled to contain both raspberry juice and flavor showed equal amounts of both enantiomers, indicating the presence of synthetic flavor.","altmetric_jid":"53222dc82a83ee27268b457b","authors":["Hansen, Anne\u2010Mette S.","Frandsen, Henrik L.","Fromberg, Arvid"],"doi":"10.1002\/fsn3.296","first_seen_on":"2017-04-21T01:59:51+00:00","issns":["20487177","2048-7177"],"issue":"3","journal":"Food Science & Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1465671922,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/fsn3.296"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/fsn3.296\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4867754","pmid":"27247764","pubdate":"2015-10-27T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Authenticity of raspberry flavor in food products using SPME-chiral-GC-MS","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/authenticity-raspberry-flavor-food-products-using-spmechiralgcms"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7881477,"mean":6.674276674566,"rank":6824802,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7881477,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":210270,"mean":12.420008275114,"rank":169990,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":210270,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":153,"mean":3.1295,"rank":125,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":153,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.625,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
