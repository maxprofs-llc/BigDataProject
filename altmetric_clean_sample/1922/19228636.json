We evaluated clinical factors associated with the laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of influenza and the performance of these influenza case definitions by using a complete dataset of 14,994 patients with acute respiratory infection (ARI) from whom a specimen was collected between August 2009 and April 2014 by the Groupes R\u00e9gionaux d'Observation de la Grippe (GROG), a French national influenza surveillance network. Cough and fever\u2009\u2265\u200939\u2009\u00b0C most accurately predicted an influenza infection in all age groups. Several other symptoms were associated with an increased risk of influenza (headache, weakness, myalgia, coryza) or decreased risk (adenopathy, pharyngitis, shortness of breath, otitis\/otalgia, bronchitis\/ bronchiolitis), but not throughout all age groups. The WHO case definition for influenza-like illness (ILI) had the highest specificity with 21.4%, while the ECDC ILI case definition had the highest sensitivity with 96.1%. The diagnosis among children younger than 5 years remains challenging. The study compared the performance of clinical influenza definitions based on outpatient surveillance and will contribute to improving the comparability of data shared at international level.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f61000738e","authors":["Jean-Sebastien Casalegno","Daniel Eibach","Martine Valette","Vincent Enouf","Isabelle Daviaud","Sylvie Behillil","Astrid Vabret","Jean Claude Soulary","Mehdi Benchaib","Jean Marie Cohen","Sylvie van der Werf","Anne Mosnier","Bruno Lina"],"doi":"10.2807\/1560-7917.es.2017.22.14.30504","first_seen_on":"2017-04-21T06:44:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1025-496X","1560-7917"],"issue":"14","journal":"Eurosurveillance","last_mentioned_on":1492757037,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28422004\/"],"pmid":"28422004","pubdate":"2017-04-06T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Performance of influenza case definitions for influenza community surveillance: based on the French influenza surveillance network GROG, 2009-2014","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/performance-influenza-case-definitions-influenza-community-surveillance-based-french-influenza-surve"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8085159,"mean":6.8783507387159,"rank":7000068,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8085159,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233054,"mean":12.781410846459,"rank":189760,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233054,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":715,"mean":5.0473137254902,"rank":631,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":715,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":2.3809523809524,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
