Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injected in neonates lead to behavioral and brain changes that persist to adult life. We investigated oxidative stress, levels of cytokines, and the locomotor activity of IA in a schizophrenia animal model in which neonatal male Wistar rats were administered with an injection of LPS (50 \u03bcg\/kg) on postnatal day 3 and different doses of ketamine (5, 15 and 25 mg\/kg) for 7 days during adulthood. Rats LPS-induced did not have locomotor activity alterations. Locomotor activity was elevated in neonatally saline-injected in the higher dose ketamine-treated animals. Carbonyl protein in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus and striatum were increased in the LPS- and saline-induced in the ketamine (25 mg\/kg)-treated animals. Lipid damage occurred in the PFC, striatum and hippocampus in the LPS- and saline-induced in the ketamine (15 and 25 mg\/kg) -treated animals. In the hippocampus the superoxide dismutase (SOD) was decreased in the LPS- and saline-induced in the ketamine-treated with the dose of 25 mg\/kg. In the PFC SOD was reduced in the LPS-induced in the ketamine (25 mg\/kg)-treated animals. Catalase in the PFC and hippocampus was reduced in the LPS- and saline-induced in the ketamine (25 mg\/kg)-treated animals. Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines were lower in the brains of LPS-induced in the higher dose ketamine-treated rats. IA influences the locomotor activity and cytokines levels induced by ketamine, and it has a negative effect in potentiating the oxidative stress by higher doses of ketamine in the brain.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031aa","authors":["R\u00e9us, Gislaine Z.","Sim\u00f5es, Lutiana R.","Colpo, Gabriela D.","Scaini, Giselli","Oses, Jean P.","Generoso, Jaqueline S.","Prossin, Alan R.","Kaddurah-Daouk, Rima","Quevedo, Jo\u00e3o","Barichello, Tatiana","Gislaine Z.
