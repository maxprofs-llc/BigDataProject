Although sensors are usually set up covering a wide range of conditions, their operational range must be established. In recent years, depth cameras have been shown as a promising tool for plant phenotyping and other related uses. However, the use of these devices is still challenged by prevailing field conditions. Although the influence of lighting conditions on the performance of these cameras has already been established, the effect of wind is still unknown. This study establishes the associated errors when modeling some tree characteristics at different wind speeds. A system using a Kinect v2 sensor and a custom software was tested from null wind speed up to 10 m\u00b7s(-1). Two tree species with contrasting architecture, poplars and plums, were used as model plants. The results showed different responses depending on tree species and wind speed. Estimations of Leaf Area (LA) and tree volume were generally more consistent at high wind speeds in plum trees. Poplars were particularly affected by wind speeds higher than 5 m\u00b7s(-1). On the contrary, height measurements were more consistent for poplars than for plum trees. These results show that the use of depth cameras for tree characterization must take into consideration wind conditions in the field. In general, 5 m\u00b7s(-1) (18 km\u00b7h(-1)) could be established as a conservative limit for good estimations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5333cf058f6100045ba","authors":["Dionisio And\u00fajar","Jos\u00e9 Dorado","Jos\u00e9 Bengochea-Guevara","Jes\u00fas Conesa-Mu\u00f1oz","C\u00e9sar Fern\u00e1ndez-Quintanilla","\u00c1ngela Ribeiro"],"doi":"10.3390\/s17040914","first_seen_on":"2017-04-21T07:13:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1424-8220"],"issue":"4","journal":"Sensors (14248220)","last_mentioned_on":1492758824,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/17\/4\/914?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/17\/4\/914\/pdf","pmid":"28430119","pubdate":"2017-04-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Influence of Wind Speed on RGB-D Images in Tree Plantations","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-wind-speed-rgbd-images-tree-plantations-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8085159,"mean":6.8783507387159,"rank":7000068,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8085159,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233054,"mean":12.781414922786,"rank":189760,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233054,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3323,"mean":1.9262546658639,"rank":2304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3323,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":622,"mean":1.2933526570048,"rank":204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":622,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
