There were no significant differences, as predicted, in any of the dependent variables after the control (ie, support group) and no intervention periods.\nResults provide strong evidence for the efficacy of this energy conservation course for persons with MS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005737","authors":["Mathiowetz, V","Matuska, K M","Murphy, M E","Virgil Mathiowetz","Kathleen M.
