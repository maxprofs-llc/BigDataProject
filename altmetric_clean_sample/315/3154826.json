However, direct and indirect environmental transmission still occurs. There is evidence for transmission of B. cepacia to CF patients via pulmonary test equipment, nebulizers and other respiratory equipment used both in CF centres and for homecare, but little or no evidence of spread through aerosols, dental equipment, hands, contaminated disinfectants and water supplies. Infection control procedures for reducing the transmission of B. cepacia are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a48","authors":["Pankhurst, C L","Philpott-Howard, J"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0195-6701(96)90035-3","first_seen_on":"2015-01-29T23:04:35+00:00","issns":["0195-6701"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Hospital Infection","last_mentioned_on":1484158600,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0195-6701(96)90035-3","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8744509","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8744509"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.journalofhospitalinfection.com\/article\/S0195670196900353\/pdf","pmid":"8744509","pubdate":"2017-01-11T18:17:15+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["hospitals","communicablediseases"],"title":"The environmental risk factors associated with medical and dental equipment in the transmission of Burkholderia (Pseudomonas) cepacia in cystic fibrosis patients.","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/environmental-risk-factors-associated-medical-dental-equipment-transmission-burkholderia-ppseudomona"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8113377,"mean":6.8875248791553,"rank":1320972,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":6719005,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8113377,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241446,"mean":8.1619137360476,"rank":46568,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":194587,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241446,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1646,"mean":6.3435817629179,"rank":242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":1294,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1646,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":5.0327368421053,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Environmental Science":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Cystic fibrosis","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=326997550#altmetric_citation_35","license":"public","citation_ids":[3154826,3154826],"posted_on":"2017-01-11T18:16:40+00:00","summary":"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that affects mostly the lungs, but also the pancreas, liver, kidneys, and intestine.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=50601","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"150.104.10.43","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Contributions\/150.104.10.43"}}],"policy":[{"title":"Heterotrophic plate counts and drinking-water safety : the significance of HPCs for water quality and human health \/ J.
