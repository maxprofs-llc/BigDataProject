VHLS manifests in a myriad of hyper-vascular tumors of both benign and malignant nature. Incidence of VHLS is roughly 1 in 36,000 live births and has over 90% penetrance by the age of 65. Improved understanding of the natural history and biology of VHLS has led to the introduction of screening protocols, early interventions and improved treatments, all of which resulted in a substantially improved prognosis for this disease. Further details regardingvariegated molecular pathways and mechanisms ofVHLS are emerging with the subsequent advent of novel treatment protocols that are currently in clinical trials.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9283cf058f61000dd24","authors":["Kim JJ","Rini BI","Hansel DE"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-29T23:19:25+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Advances in experimental medicine and biology","last_mentioned_on":1349703392,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20687511"],"pmid":"20687511","pubdate":"2009-12-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","biology"],"title":"Von Hippel Lindau syndrome.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/von-hippel-lindau-syndrome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3619417,"mean":4.9286052998637,"rank":815675,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2280041,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3619417,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93100,"mean":7.2244568470123,"rank":23760,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68253,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93100,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":967,"mean":2.1890579710145,"rank":116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":627,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":967,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":1.6136363636364,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
