A strong contribution of host genetics to susceptibility to leprosy has long been suggested to account for the considerable variability observed between individuals exposed to M. leprae. As there is no relevant animal model for human leprosy, forward genetics is the main strategy used to identify the genes and, consequently, the immunological pathways involved in protective immunity to M. leprae. With respect to genome-wide screens, a major breakthrough has been reported this year; variants in the regulatory region shared by PARK2 and PACRG have been identified as being common risk factors for leprosy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a4","authors":["Alca\u00efs A","Mira M","Casanova JL","Schurr E","Abel L","Alexandre Alca\u00efs","Marcelo Mira","Jean-Laurent Casanova","Erwin Schurr","Laurent Abel"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.coi.2004.11.006","first_seen_on":"2015-01-30T00:57:32+00:00","issns":["0952-7915","09527915"],"issue":"1","journal":"Current Opinion in Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1187313035,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.coi.2004.11.006","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15653309","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15653309"],"pmid":"15653309","pubdate":"2005-01-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Genetic dissection of immunity in leprosy.","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genetic-dissection-immunity-leprosy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628371,"mean":4.9417862081361,"rank":817155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288150,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628371,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94782,"mean":8.0496595731213,"rank":24661,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69034,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94782,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":393,"mean":2.4049795918367,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":230,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":393,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.9227272727273,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
