However, recent observations of both Jupiter and Saturn have revealed surface features with periods close to those derived for the interiors. In the study reported here, this process is carried one stage further, with the derivation of a rotation rate for the spot associated with Satum's polar hexagon, which is simultaneously within and more accurate than the Saturnian radio period.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"1990Sci...247.1206G","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["D.
