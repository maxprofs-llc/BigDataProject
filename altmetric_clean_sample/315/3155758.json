We demonstrate that whereas refolding of oxidized lysozyme is hardly affected by crowding, correct refolding of the reduced protein is essentially abolished due to aggregation at high concentrations of crowding agents. The results show that the protein folding catalyst protein disulfide isomerase is particularly effective in preventing lysozyme aggregation under crowded conditions, suggesting that crowding enhances its chaperone activity. Our findings suggest that the effects of macromolecular crowding could have major implications for our understanding of how protein folding occurs inside cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027b6","authors":["Bert van den Berg","R.John Ellis","Christopher M.
