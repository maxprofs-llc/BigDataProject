Acute infective conjunctivitis is a common presentation in primary healthcare. It is usually a mild condition and serious complications are rare. Clinical signs are a poor discriminator of bacterial and viral causes. Studies of treatment show that there is a high rate of clinical cure without any treatment (65% within 2-5 days). Treatment with topical antibiotics improves the rate of clinical recovery and this is more marked in the first 2-5 days after presentation (number needed to treat [NNT] = 6), but less by 6-10 days (NNT = 13). Studies comparing treatment with different antibiotics do not demonstrate that any one antibiotic is superior; the choice of antibiotic should be based on consideration of cost and bacterial resistance. The present practice of prescribing antibiotics to most cases is not necessary.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073c7","authors":["Peter Rose","Rose P"],"doi":"10.1517\/14656566.8.12.1903","endpage":"1921","first_seen_on":"2015-01-29T21:42:29+00:00","issns":["1465-6566","1744-7666"],"issue":"12","journal":"Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1448928000,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1517\/14656566.8.12.1903","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17696792","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1517\/14656566.8.12.1903?journalCode=ieop20#.Vdxa2JjbJaQ"],"pmid":"17696792","pubdate":"2007-01-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"1903","subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Management strategies for acute infective conjunctivitis in primary care: a systematic review.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1517\/14656566.8.12.1903","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/management-strategies-acute-infective-conjunctivitis-primary-care-systematic-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7027828,"mean":6.2647750304584,"rank":1077154,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":5926716,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7027828,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233473,"mean":7.8692157346493,"rank":43597,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":189696,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233473,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1144,"mean":2.002915135608,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":1073,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1144,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":1.8102564102564,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
