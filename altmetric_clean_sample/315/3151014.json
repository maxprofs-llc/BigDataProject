Two major advantages of this method are that the staining solution, ready for use, is stable at ambient temperature indefinitely and that microscopic examination of bacteria in the stained drop preparations can be performed rapidly.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be9","authors":["H Kodaka","A Y Armfield","G L Lombard","V R Dowell"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-29T21:24:55+00:00","issns":["1098-660X","0095-1137"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Clinical Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1448273345,"links":["http:\/\/jcm.asm.org\/cgi\/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=6185531","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/6185531","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC272507\/pdf\/jcm00148-0198.pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jcm.asm.org\/content\/16\/5\/948.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC272507","pmid":"6185531","pubdate":"2015-06-04T02:40:22+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Practical procedure for demonstrating bacterial flagella.","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/practical-procedure-demonstrating-bacterial-flagella"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6597995,"mean":6.1232477659116,"rank":3140020,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1969915,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6597995,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":209135,"mean":8.4014104067251,"rank":108152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":76573,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":209135,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3446,"mean":3.9328621190131,"rank":1846,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1055,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3446,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":2.6494680851064,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
