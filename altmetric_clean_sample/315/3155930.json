Vigilance-specific recordings of the electroencephalogram (EEG) potently reflect thalamo-cortical and brainstem-cortical cholinergic activity that drives theta rhythms and task-specific cortical (de-synchronisation. Additionally, cholinergic projections from the basal forebrain act as a relay centre for the brainstem-cortical arousal system, but also directly modulate cortical activity, and thus promote wakefulness or rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep. Disease states such as sleep disorders, dementia and certain types of epilepsy are a further reflection of the potent cholinergic impact on CNS physiology and function, and highlight the relevance and inter-dependence of sleep and EEG. With novel technologies and computational tools now becoming available, advanced mechanistic insights may be gained and new avenues explored for diagnostics and therapeutics.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023ad","authors":["Platt B","Riedel G"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbr.2011.01.017","first_seen_on":"2015-01-29T23:32:24+00:00","issns":["0166-4328"],"issue":"2","journal":"Behavioural Brain Research","last_mentioned_on":1314646307,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.bbr.2011.01.017","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21238497"],"pmid":"21238497","pubdate":"2011-01-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["brain","behavioralsciences"],"title":"The cholinergic system, EEG and sleep.","type":"article","volume":"221","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cholinergic-system-eeg-sleep"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627694,"mean":4.9472740289804,"rank":817554,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2286849,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627694,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94554,"mean":8.0372758558693,"rank":24584,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68880,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94554,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1299,"mean":3.0515408320493,"rank":256,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":828,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1299,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":1.7141304347826,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Researcher":28,"Student  > Ph.
