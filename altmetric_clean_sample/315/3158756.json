We show that both these viruses enter HeLa cells by clathrin-dependent endocytosis and require vacuolar acidic pH. Inhibition of the GTPase Rab 5 or 7, which regulates transport to early or late endosomes, respectively, demonstrated that Rab 5 was essential for survival of both dengue and West Nile virus. These data broaden our understanding of the pathways required for productive dengue and West Nile virus infection and may facilitate new strategies for combating disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f92","authors":["Manoj N.
