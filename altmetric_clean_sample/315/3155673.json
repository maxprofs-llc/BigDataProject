Within non-crocodilian reptiles, ventricular pressure separation has only been observed in varanid lizards and has been regarded as a unique adaptation to an active predatory life style and high metabolic rate. The systemic and pulmonary sides of the ventricle in Python molurus are well separated by the muscular ridge, and a previous study using in situ perfusion of the heart revealed a remarkable flow separation and showed that the systemic side can sustain higher output pressures than the pulmonary side. Here we extend these observations by showing that systemic blood pressure P(sys) exceeded pulmonary pressure P(pul) almost seven times (75.7+\/-4.2 versus 11.6+\/-1.1 cm H(2)O). The large pressure difference between the systemic and pulmonary circulation persisted when P(sys) was altered by infusion of sodium nitroprusside or phenylephrine. Intraventricular pressures, measured in anaesthetised snakes, showed an overlap in the pressure profile between the pulmonary side of the ventricle (cavum pulmonale) and the pulmonary artery, while the higher pressure in the systemic side of the ventricle (cavum arteriosum) overlapped with the pressure in the right aortic arch. This verifies that the pressure differences originate within the ventricle, indicating that the large muscular ridge separates the ventricle during cardiac contraction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f43cf058f610002d97","authors":["Tobias Wang","Jordi Altimiras","Wilfried Klein","Michael Axelsson","Wang T","Altimiras J","Klein W","Axelsson M"],"doi":"10.1242\/jeb.00681","first_seen_on":"2015-01-29T23:25:20+00:00","issns":["1477-9145"],"journal":"Journal of Experimental Biology","last_mentioned_on":1473136489,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1242\/jeb.00681","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14581594","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14581594"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jeb.biologists.org\/content\/206\/23\/4241.full.pdf","pmid":"14581594","pubdate":"2003-12-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Ventricular haemodynamics in Python molurus: separation of pulmonary and systemic pressures.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ventricular-haemodynamics-python-molurus-separation-pulmonary-systemic-pressures"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336644,"mean":7.0294968595789,"rank":2133702,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5065460,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336644,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243664,"mean":8.20550455342,"rank":69670,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":168026,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243664,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4374,"mean":10.761167162131,"rank":1899,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2074,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4374,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108,"mean":10.230130841121,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
