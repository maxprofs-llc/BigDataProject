The protein is a dimer in solution, and each subunit is composed of a five-stranded beta-barrel with a topology very similar to that of the SH3 domain. The dimer is formed by a stacked beta-interface comprising strands 2, 3, and 4, with the two triple-stranded antiparallel beta-sheets, one from each subunit, oriented antiparallel to each other. One surface of the dimer, bounded by the loop between strands beta 1 and beta 2, forms a saddle-shaped groove with dimensions of approximately 24 x 23 x 12 A in cross section. Lys264, which has been shown from mutational data to be involved in DNA binding, protrudes from this surface, implicating the saddle-shaped groove as the potential DNA binding site.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c7","authors":["P J Lodi","J A Ernst","J Kuszewski","A B Hickman","A Engelman","R Craigie","G M Clore","A M Gronenborn"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-30T00:35:39+00:00","issns":["0006-2960"],"issue":"31","journal":"Biochemistry (00062979)","last_mentioned_on":1303291124,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7632683"],"pmid":"7632683","pubdate":"1995-08-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Solution structure of the DNA binding domain of HIV-1 integrase.","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/solution-structure-dna-binding-domain-hiv1-integrase-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629356,"mean":4.9352152798544,"rank":816513,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290041,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629356,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94922,"mean":8.062123997851,"rank":24710,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69120,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94922,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5464,"mean":2.4658711330771,"rank":228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1692,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5464,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98,"mean":1.3453608247423,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":93,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
