Leucocytes were localised by immunohistochemistry labelling and quantified in subepithelial and deep stromal areas. CD45+ leucocytes were more numerous in the subepithelial area of the cervix than in the deep stroma in all groups (P<0.01). CD14+ macrophages and CD15+ granulocytes were increased in both the subepithelial and deep stromal areas only in the vaginal delivery group (P<0.01). The number of macrophages in the ripening cervix (Bishop score above 4) was higher than in the unripe cervix (Bishop score 4 or less; P<0.05) with no differences in other leucocyte populations. CD3+ CD8+ T cells in the subepithelial area were reduced in late pregnancy and after vaginal delivery (P<0.01), but showed no relationship to Bishop score. Macrophages and granulocytes may be involved in the process of cervical dilatation, but macrophage infiltration into the ripening cervix before labour suggests their role in the ripening process. Reduced numbers of CD3+ CD8+ T-lymphocytes in late pregnancy and after vaginal delivery suggests that local immunity is down-regulated in the late pregnancy period. Regional differences in leucocyte subpopulations in the cervix indicate that leucocyte infiltration is likely to be regulated by local factors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f03","doi":"10.1016\/j.jri.2005.04.005","first_seen_on":"2011-08-16T03:47:09+00:00","issns":["0165-0378"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Reproductive Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1242259200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16045998"],"pmid":"16045998","pubdate":"2005-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Macrophages and not granulocytes are involved in cervical ripening.","type":"article","volume":"66","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/macrophages-not-granulocytes-involved-cervical-ripening"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626769,"mean":4.9522514062143,"rank":2018782,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":930851,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626769,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51711,"mean":4.7335309224521,"rank":22225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":21518,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51711,"percentile":41},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":188,"mean":3.3334973262032,"rank":92,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":188,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
