WHO technical guidelines recommend that health workers should undertake this part of the strategy, but will also accept direct observation of treatment in the community; WHO does not think that a family member should undertake this role. Supporting evidence for these recommendations is not available. The Nepal national tuberculosis programme asked us to develop and test a strategy of direct observation of treatment for the hill districts of Nepal, where direct observation of treatment by health workers is not feasible. We aimed to assess the success rates of two DOTS strategies developed for such areas.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008b2a","authors":["James N Newell","Sushil C Baral","Shanta B Pande","Dirgh Sing Bam","Pushpa Malla"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0140-6736(06)68380-3","first_seen_on":"2011-08-16T04:21:05+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1474-547X","01406736"],"issue":"9514","journal":"The Lancet","last_mentioned_on":1483228800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16546538","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0140-6736(06)68380-3"],"pmid":"16546538","pubdate":"2006-03-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Family-member DOTS and community DOTS for tuberculosis control in Nepal: cluster-randomised controlled trial.","type":"article","volume":"367","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/familymember-dots-community-dots-tuberculosis-control-nepal-clusterrandomised-controlled-trial"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.25,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7965219,"mean":6.7280072798953,"rank":1641888,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6310958,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7965219,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67146,"mean":6.0032737210514,"rank":15113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":51790,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67146,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23221,"mean":26.399969853575,"rank":11333,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":11815,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23221,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":460,"mean":11.639673202614,"rank":192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":260,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":460,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":19,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
