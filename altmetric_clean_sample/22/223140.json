This has been fueled by steady improvements of publicly available automated servers over the last decade, in particular their ability to build good homology models for an increasing number of targets by reliably detecting and aligning more and more remotely homologous templates. Here, we describe the three fully automated versions of the HHpred server that participated in the community-wide blind protein structure prediction competition CASP8. What makes HHpred unique is the combination of usability, short response times (typically under 15 min) and a model accuracy that is competitive with those of the best servers in CASP8.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f610008647","doi":"10.1002\/prot.22499","first_seen_on":"2011-08-12T15:46:09+00:00","issns":["1097-0134"],"journal":"Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics","last_mentioned_on":1301329501,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19626712","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/prot.22499"],"pmid":"19626712","pubdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Online Library","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Fast and accurate automatic structure prediction with HHpred","type":"article","volume":"77 Suppl 9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fast-accurate-automatic-structure-prediction-hhpred"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628216,"mean":4.9435109727551,"rank":539469,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":3085973,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628216,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55777,"mean":4.6137943918531,"rank":9083,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":46609,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55777,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1038,"mean":1.8011726133076,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":1017,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1038,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.78571428571429,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":11,"Researcher":49,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
