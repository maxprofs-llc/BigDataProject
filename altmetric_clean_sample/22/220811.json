This scaling relation holds for galaxies spanning a luminosity range of 14 magnitudes and the whole Hubble sequence. Here we report that the luminous matter surface density is also constant within one scale-length of the dark halo. This means that the gravitational acceleration generated by the luminous component in galaxies is always the same at this radius. Although the total luminous-to-dark matter ratio is not constant, within one halo scale-length it is constant. Our finding can be interpreted as a close correlation between the enclosed surface densities of luminous and dark matter in galaxies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2009Natur.461..627G","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003160","arxiv_id":"0909.5203","authors":["Gianfranco Gentile","Benoit Famaey","HongSheng Zhao","Paolo Salucci","Gentile G","Famaey B","Zhao H","Salucci P"],"doi":"10.1038\/nature08437","endpage":"628","first_seen_on":"2011-08-11T22:14:09+00:00","handle":"1854\/LU-955008","handles":["1854\/LU-955008"],"issns":["0028-0836","1476-4687"],"issue":"7264","journal":"Nature","last_mentioned_on":1255054460,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nature\/journal\/v461\/n7264\/full\/nature08437.html","http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/0909.5203","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1038\/nature08437"],"pmid":"19794488","pubdate":"2009-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"627","subjects":["science"],"title":"Universality of galactic surface densities within one dark halo\n  scale-length","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/nature08437","volume":"461","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/universality-galactic-surface-densities-within-one-dark-halo-scalelength"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4492472,"mean":4.7708186478339,"rank":3449905,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":133353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4492472,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58754,"mean":4.6543690705155,"rank":40404,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":500,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58754,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38083,"mean":42.281796019117,"rank":35767,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":1024,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38083,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":863,"mean":38.211382830626,"rank":837,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":863,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":17,"Student  > Ph.
