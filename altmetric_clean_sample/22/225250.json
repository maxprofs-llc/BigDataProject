Accumulating evidence suggests that Akt perturbations play an important role in human malignancy. Here, we investigated Akt perturbation in nickel-transformed cells. Chronic treatment of human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells with low doses of nickel chloride resulted in cell transformation demonstrated by anchorage-independent (AI) growth, increased cell growth and alterations of cell growth pattern. Western blot assays show that phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473, but not that of p38, JNK and ERK, was increased in nickel-transformed cells compared with controls. Inhibition of Akt or PI3K by pharmacological or biochemical interference suppressed nickel AI growth and cell growth of transformed cells. Activation of Akt led to inhibition of GSK3\u03b2 by phosphorylation at Ser9 in nickel-transformed cells. In addition, two major anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl family, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, were increased in nickel-transformed cells. By employing the small interfering RNA technique (siRNA), our results showed that siRNA Akt attenuated the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL in nickel-transformed cells, indicating that induction of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL was likely mediated through Akt. ROS generation was decreased in nickel-transformed cells compared with controls. Moreover, down-regulation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb) was observed in nickel-transformed cells. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that activation of Akt, followed by GSK3\u03b2 inhibition and Bcl-2, Bcl-XL up-regulation and decrease of ROS generation, along with a synergistic effect of Rb down-regulation may cause apoptosis resistance, contributing to the overall mechanism of nickel carcinogenesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f610007977","authors":["Pan JJ","Chang QS","Wang X","Son YO","Liu J","Zhang Z","Bi YY","Shi X","Xianglin Shi"],"doi":"10.3892\/ijo.2011.1157","first_seen_on":"2011-08-14T20:52:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1791-2423","1019-6439"],"issue":"5","journal":"International Journal of Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1313354860,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21837363?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21837363","pubdate":"2011-08-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Activation of Akt\/GSK3\u03b2 and Akt\/Bcl-2 signaling pathways in nickel-transformed BEAS-2B cells.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.spandidos-publications.com\/10.3892\/ijo.2011.1157","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/activation-aktgsk3%CE%B2-aktbcl2-signaling-pathways-nickeltransformed-beas2b-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4681163,"mean":5.6987966927893,"rank":3319886,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":759863,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4681163,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59251,"mean":5.343103021097,"rank":40428,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":7936,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59251,"percentile":13},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1022,"mean":2.1161860920666,"rank":638,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":210,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1022,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":4.8064516129032,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
