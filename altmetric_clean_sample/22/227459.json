Loss of KRIT1 disrupts cardiovascular development and causes autosomal dominant familial cerebral cavernous malformations. Here we report that native KRIT1 protein binds the effector loop of Rap1A but not H-Ras in a GTP-dependent manner, establishing that it is an authentic Rap1-specific effector. By modeling the KRIT1-Rap1 interface we designed a well-folded KRIT1 mutant that exhibited a ~40-fold-reduced affinity for Rap1A and maintained other KRIT1-binding functions. Direct binding of KRIT1 to Rap1 stabilized endothelial cell-cell junctions in vitro and was required for cardiovascular development in vivo. Mechanistically, Rap1 binding released KRIT1 from microtubules, enabling it to locate to cell--cell junctions, where it suppressed Rho kinase signaling and stabilized the junctions. These studies establish that the direct physical interaction of Rap1 with KRIT1 enables the translocation of microtubule-sequestered KRIT1 to junctions, thereby supporting junctional integrity and cardiovascular development.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c7","doi":"10.1091\/mbc.e11-02-0157","first_seen_on":"2011-08-16T03:24:36+00:00","issns":["1939-4586"],"issue":"14","journal":"Molecular Biology of the Cell","last_mentioned_on":1312848000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21633110"],"pmid":"21633110","pubdate":"2011-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"A mechanism of Rap1-induced stabilization of endothelial cell-cell junctions.","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mechanism-rap1induced-stabilization-endothelial-cellcell-junctions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632582,"mean":4.9236596667819,"rank":2015235,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":945670,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632582,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51742,"mean":4.6717131868344,"rank":21985,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":22217,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51742,"percentile":42},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1828,"mean":2.4986425834702,"rank":929,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":346,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1828,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":1.6678571428571,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
