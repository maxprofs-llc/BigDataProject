The number and spatial organization of cone types varies dramatically among species, presumably to fine-tune the retina for different visual environments. In the mouse, S- and M-opsin are expressed in an opposing dorsal-ventral gradient. We previously reported that cone opsin patterning requires thyroid hormone beta2, a nuclear hormone receptor that regulates transcription in conjunction with its ligand, thyroid hormone (TH). Here we show that exogenous TH inhibits S-opsin expression, but activates M-opsin expression. Binding of endogenous TH to TRbeta2 is required to inhibit S-opsin and to activate M-opsin. TH is symmetrically distributed in the retina at birth as S-opsin expression begins, but becomes elevated in the dorsal retina at the time of M-opsin onset (postnatal day 10). Our results show that TH is a critical regulator of both S-opsin and M-opsin, and suggest that a TH gradient may play a role in establishing the gradient of M-opsin. These results also suggest that the ratio and patterning of cone types may be determined by TH availability during retinal development.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2006PNAS..103.6218R","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","doi":"10.1073\/pnas.0509981103","first_seen_on":"2011-08-16T04:25:37+00:00","issns":["0027-8424"],"issue":"16","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1146182400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16606843"],"pmid":"16606843","pubdate":"2006-04-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Making the gradient: thyroid hormone regulates cone opsin expression in the developing mouse retina.","type":"article","volume":"103","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/making-gradient-thyroid-hormone-regulates-cone-opsin-expression-developing-mouse-retina"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629240,"mean":4.9358355666342,"rank":2016321,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":938933,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629240,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51727,"mean":4.6988769670958,"rank":22092,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":21921,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51727,"percentile":42},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33579,"mean":13.637945440467,"rank":23207,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":4442,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33579,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":796,"mean":9.7689735849057,"rank":468,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":258,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":796,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":27,"Student  > Ph.
