I reject Gesang's claim that there is such a thing as moral expertise, although the moral philosopher may well make a valid contribution to the ethics committee as a concerned and educated citizen. I suggest that wisdom is a lot more interesting to examine than moral expertise. Again, however, moral philosophers have no monopoly on wisdom, and the study of philosophy may even impede its cultivation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023cc","authors":["COWLEY, CHRISTOPHER"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1467-8519.2010.01860.x","endpage":"342","first_seen_on":"2011-08-11T23:20:19+00:00","issns":["1467-8519","0269-9702"],"issue":"6","journal":"Bioethics","last_mentioned_on":1295811139,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1467-8519.2010.01860.x\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1467-8519.2010.01860.x\/pdf","pmid":"21241345","pubdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Ethics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Philosophy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"337","subjects":["ethics"],"title":"EXPERTISE, WISDOM AND MORAL PHILOSOPHERS: A RESPONSE TO GESANG","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expertise-wisdom-moral-philosophers-response-gesang"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3624912,"mean":4.9388872667219,"rank":2907091,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":72759,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3624912,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55711,"mean":4.622644372644,"rank":38717,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55711,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":359,"mean":3.5035195530726,"rank":251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":359,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
