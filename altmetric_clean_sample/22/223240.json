A proportion of these will alter protein sequences, the most common of which is the non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (nsSNP). It would be an advantage if the functional effects of an nsSNP on protein structure and function could be predicted, both for the final identification process of a causal variant in a disease-associated chromosome region, and in further functional analyses of the nsSNP and its disease-associated protein.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007a9","authors":["Burke DF","Worth CL","Priego EM","Cheng T","Smink LJ","Todd JA","Blundell TL","David F Burke","Catherine L Worth","Eva-Maria Priego","Tammy Cheng","Luc J Smink","John A Todd","Tom L Blundell"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2105-8-301","first_seen_on":"2011-08-12T15:59:40+00:00","issns":["1471-2105","","14712105"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","last_mentioned_on":1295870358,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17708757","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17708757?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC1978506","pmid":"17708757","pubdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Computer Science"],"startpage":"301","subjects":["computationalbiology"],"title":"Genome bioinformatic analysis of nonsynonymous SNPs.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2105-8-301","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genome-bioinformatic-analysis-nonsynonymous-snps"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4681522,"mean":5.6990934027662,"rank":851194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":3808587,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4681522,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59209,"mean":5.351502465883,"rank":11621,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":47197,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59209,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2735,"mean":4.8074520848573,"rank":726,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":1991,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2735,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79,"mean":4.7843076923077,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":58,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":28,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
