In this study, CARs were constructed containing a FR\u03b1-specific scFv (MOv19) coupled to the T-cell receptor CD3\u03b6 chain signaling module alone (MOv19-\u03b6) or in combination with the CD137 (4-1BB) costimulatory motif in tandem (MOv19-BB\u03b6). Primary human T cells transduced to express conventional MOv19-\u03b6 or costimulated MOv19-BB\u03b6 CARs secreted various proinflammatory cytokines, and exerted cytotoxic function when cocultured with FR\u03b1(+) tumor cells in vitro. However, only transfer of human T cells expressing the costimulated MOv19-BB\u03b6 CAR mediated tumor regression in immunodeficient mice bearing large, established FR\u03b1(+) human cancer. MOv19-BB\u03b6 CAR T-cell infusion mediated tumor regression in models of metastatic intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, and lung-involved human ovarian cancer. Importantly, tumor response was associated with the selective survival and tumor localization of human T cells in vivo and was only observed in mice receiving costimulated MOv19-BB\u03b6 CAR T cells. T-cell persistence and antitumor activity were primarily antigen-driven; however, antigen-independent CD137 signaling by CAR improved T-cell persistence but not antitumor activity in vivo. Our results show that anti-FR\u03b1 CAR outfitted with CD137 costimulatory signaling in tandem overcome issues of T-cell persistence and tumor localization that limit the conventional FR\u03b1 T-cell targeting strategy to provide potent antitumor activity in vivo.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dd4","authors":["Song DG","Ye Q","Carpenito C","Poussin M","Wang LP","Ji C","Figini M","June CH","Coukos G","Powell DJ Jr"],"doi":"10.1158\/0008-5472.can-11-0422","endpage":"4627","first_seen_on":"2011-08-12T15:56:54+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1538-7445","0008-5472"],"issue":"13","journal":"Cancer Research","last_mentioned_on":1313149560,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21546571","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1158\/0008-5472.CAN-11-0422"],"pmid":"21546571","pubdate":"2011-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"4617","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"In vivo persistence, tumor localization, and antitumor activity of CAR-engineered T cells is enhanced by costimulatory signaling through CD137 (4-1BB).","type":"article","volume":"71","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vivo-persistence-tumor-localization-antitumor-activity-carengineered-t-cells-enhanced-costimulatory"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.992,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.992},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4256174,"mean":5.1191184833717,"rank":487600,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":3768437,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4256174,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57898,"mean":4.7219671140128,"rank":7480,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":50413,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57898,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5563,"mean":4.0352193455591,"rank":482,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":5081,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5563,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102,"mean":1.8356633663366,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":97,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":33,"Student  > Ph.
