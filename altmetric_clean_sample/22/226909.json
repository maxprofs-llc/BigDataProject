A rationale therapeutic approach for the treatment of vulvodynia is still under investigation. A review of treatment modalities proposed by most of the clinicians involved in managing these patients advocated initially utilizing non-invasive therapies and then to proceed gradually to more aggressive therapies. A multidisciplinary approach that includes behavioral science and neuroimaging is required and recommended. Additionally a team approach should be utilized to test and evaluate therapies including pelvic floor physiotheraphy, psychotherapy, microbiology and pharmacology. It is my hope that this review will assist in the understanding of vulvodynia and its measuring treatment outcomes and will provide a thrust in the right direction to once and for all clarify this complex multifactorial disorder affecting women.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8203cf058f61000bc3f","authors":["Gary Ventolini"],"doi":"10.4021\/jocmr526w","first_seen_on":"2011-08-15T19:19:46+00:00","issns":["19183003"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Clinical Medicine Research","last_mentioned_on":1313437303,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3140924\/?tool=pmcentrez"],"pmid":"21811531","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elmer Press","startpage":"59","title":"Measuring Treatment Outcomes in Women With Vulvodynia","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/measuring-treatment-outcomes-women-vulvodynia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":2496907,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2389274,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60782,"mean":5.4388356229743,"rank":27359,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":31710,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60782,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":210,"mean":1.5234832535885,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":140,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":210,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
