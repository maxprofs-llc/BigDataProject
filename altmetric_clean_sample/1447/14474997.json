Questionnaires assessing weight-related behaviors were completed in senior year.\nOf the original 117 students, 86 remained in the study for 4\u00a0years. Body mass index was significantly higher at the end of senior year (mean, 24.84; SD, 4.46) vs the beginning of freshman year (mean, 23.59; SD, 4.01; t[85]\u00a0=\u00a05.61; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Weight was significantly higher at the end of senior year (mean, 71.32\u00a0kg; SD, 15.60) vs the beginning of freshman year (mean, 66.94\u00a0kg; SD, 14.02; t[85]\u00a0=\u00a06.60; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Students' mean weight gain was 4.38\u00a0kg and the sample increased from 23% to 41% overweight\/obese. No\u00a0significant associations were found between BMI and lifestyle factors.\nThis study suggests that students gain weight throughout college, which highlights the need for weight control interventions to target more than just freshman college students.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000cb1","authors":["Lizzy Pope","Danielle Hansen","Jean Harvey","Pope, Lizzy","Hansen, Danielle","Harvey, Jean"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jneb.2016.10.014","first_seen_on":"2016-12-05T22:23:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1878-2620","14994046"],"journal":"Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1501503295,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=9&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jneb.org%2Farticle%2FS1499-4046%2816%2930872-7%2Ffulltext&code=jneb-site","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jneb.2016.10.014","http:\/\/www.jneb.org\/article\/S1499-4046(16)30872-7\/fulltext","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jneb.org%2Farticle%2FS1499-4046%2816%2930872-7%2Ffulltext%3Fplatform%3Dhootsuite&code=jneb-site","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=9&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jneb.org%2Farticle%2FS1499-4046%2816%2930872-7%2Fabstract&code=jneb-site","http:\/\/www.jneb.org\/article\/S1499-4046(16)30872-7\/fulltext?platform=hootsuite","http:\/\/www.jneb.org\/article\/S1499-4046(16)30872-7\/fulltext?rss=yes","http:\/\/www.jneb.org\/article\/S1499-4046(16)30872-7\/abstract","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=3&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jneb.org%2Farticle%2FS1499-4046%2816%2930872-7%2Fabstract&code=jneb-site","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=2&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jneb.org%2Farticle%2FS1499-4046%2816%2930872-7%2Fabstract&code=jneb-site","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1499404616308727","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=2&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jneb.org%2Farticle%2FS1499-4046%2816%2930872-7%2Fpdf&code=jneb-site","http:\/\/www.jneb.org\/article\/S1499-4046(16)30872-7\/fulltext#.WGKoTEp2eMc.facebook","http:\/\/www.jneb.org\/article\/S1499-4046(16)30872-7\/fulltext?sf85222454=1","http:\/\/www.jneb.org\/article\/S1499-4046(16)30872-7\/fulltext?sf85222470=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jneb.org\/article\/S1499404616308727\/pdf","pmid":"27923616","pubdate":"2016-12-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["education","behavioralsciences","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Examining the Weight Trajectory of College Students","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1499404616308727","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/examining-weight-trajectory-college-students"},"altmetric_score":{"score":326.81,"score_history":{"1y":326.81,"6m":2.1,"3m":2.1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":326.81},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8302353,"mean":6.9982161057411,"rank":17838,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":8284546,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8302353,"percentile":99},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275776,"mean":12.063641787689,"rank":1618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":274158,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275776,"percentile":99},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":643,"mean":10.598641744548,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":642,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":643,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":10,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":11,"researcher":6,"practitioner":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":6,"Members of the public":11,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Social Sciences":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":2,"Arts and Humanities":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":6,"AU":1,"IE":4,"SE":1}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"What else comes with a college degree?
