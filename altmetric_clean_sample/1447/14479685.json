Data from the group of active subjects living at home was used to derive reference ranges for elderly women. Although the index values of this group did not differ greatly from those seen in young subjects, there were large differences between this and some of the other elderly groups where the frequency of low values was as high as 50% for some parameters. Food intakes were measured in four of the six groups and relationships were found between energy, protein and vitamin C intake and body weight, plasma protein levels and vitamin C concentration, respectively. Our findings suggest that, among elderly women, low levels of nutrient intake make a significant contribution to poor anthropometric and biochemical nutritional status. Improvements in diet should be reflected in the indices measured and might, in turn, have beneficial effects on health.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f6100021a6","authors":["D.
