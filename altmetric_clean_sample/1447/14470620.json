For physicians in groups randomised to the individual visit arm, 43 of 70 general practitioners participated; in the group visit intervention arm, five of seven groups (41 of 52 general practitioners) participated.\nNumbers of elderly people (>\/=60 years) with new prescriptions of highly anticholinergic antidepressants and less anticholinergic antidepressants.\nAn intention to treat analysis found a 26% reduction in the rate of starting highly anticholinergic antidepressants in elderly people (95% confidence interval -4% to 48%) in the individual intervention arm and 45% (8% to 67%) in the group intervention arm. The use of less anticholinergic antidepressants increased by 40% (6% to 83%) in the individual intervention arm and 29% (-7% to 79%) in the group intervention arm.\nBoth the individual and the group visits decreased the use of highly anticholinergic antidepressants and increased the use of less anticholinergic antidepressant in elderly people. These approaches are practical means to improve prescribing by continuing medical education.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000245c","authors":["Martine E C van Eijk","Jerry Avorn","Arijan J Porsius","Anthonius de Boer"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmj.322.7287.654","endpage":"654","first_seen_on":"2016-12-05T18:41:16+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0959-8138","1468-5833","09598138"],"issue":"7287","journal":"British Medical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1262304000,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/bmj.322.7287.654"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.bmj.com\/content\/bmj\/322\/7287\/654.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC26547","pmid":"11250852","pubdate":"2001-03-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"British Medical Journal Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"654","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Reducing prescribing of highly anticholinergic antidepressants for elderly people: randomised trial of group versus individual academic","type":"article","volume":"322","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reducing-prescribing-highly-anticholinergic-antidepressants-elderly-people-randomised-trial-group-ve"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6658311,"mean":6.1605570951165,"rank":1550862,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":4466462,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6658311,"percentile":67},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99721,"mean":10.76746456077,"rank":29584,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":69052,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99721,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28432,"mean":21.938837255109,"rank":16315,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":9632,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28432,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":416,"mean":31.400255421687,"rank":299,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":106,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":416,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":4,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
