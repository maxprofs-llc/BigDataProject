Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) could be even more atherogenic than serum lipids. We studied the association of ox-LDL and serum lipids with physical fitness. Healthy young (mean age 25 years) men (n=846) underwent maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2max)) and muscle fitness index (MFI) tests and completed a leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) questionnaire. Age (ANCOVA1), age+waist circumference+systolic blood pressure+fasting blood glucose+smoking (ANCOVA3) were used as covariates. The groups with the lowest VO(2max), MFI and LTPA had 23%, 16% and 8% higher concentrations of ox-LDL than the groups with the highest VO(2max) (P<0.0001), MFI (P=0.022) and LTPA (P=0.039) groups, respectively. Subjects with poor fitness (low VO(2max) or low MFI) or low LTPA had elevated levels of ox-LDL\/high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and a low level of HDL-cholesterol (ANCOVA1, in all, P<0.05). Furthermore, low VO(2max) is associated with a high level of ox-LDL\/HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides, and with a low level of HDL-cholesterol (ANCOVA3, in all, P<0.05). Also, subjects with low LTPA had a high ratio of ox-LDL\/HDL-cholesterol (ANCOVA1, P=0.001). In conclusion, both poor fitness (both low VO(2max) and low MFI) and low LTPA are associated with a higher concentration of ox-LDL lipids and serum lipids, which may indicate a higher risk for atherosclerosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100034c5","authors":["Kosola, J.","Ahotupa, M.","Kyr\u00f6l\u00e4inen, H.","Santtila, M.","Vasankari, T."],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1600-0838.2011.01326.x","endpage":"755","first_seen_on":"2012-11-07T19:07:13+00:00","issns":["1600-0838","0905-7188"],"issue":"6","journal":"Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports","last_mentioned_on":1352315174,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1600-0838.2011.01326.x\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1600-0838.2011.01326.x\/pdf","pmid":"21545538","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"746","subjects":["sportsmedicine"],"title":"Both poor cardiorespiratory and weak muscle fitness are related to a high concentration of oxidized low\u00e2\u0080\u0090density lipoprotein lipids","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/both-poor-cardiorespiratory-weak-muscle-fitness-related-high-concentration-oxidized-lowdensity-lipop"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":3082649,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":965015,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81310,"mean":5.4322518048432,"rank":53215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":18476,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81310,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1049,"mean":8.9339007633588,"rank":885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":88,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1049,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
