Previous studies have mainly focused on endothermic organisms, while poikilothermic species may have evolved different mechanisms to cope with high-elevation environments. In this context, we sequenced transcriptomes of a pair of closely related anuran species, Rana chensinensis and R. kukunoris, which inhabit respective low- and high-elevation habitats. By comparing the two transcriptomes, we identified candidate genes that may be involved in high-elevation adaption in poikilothermic species.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b9","authors":["Weizhao Yang","Yin Qi","Ke Bi","Jinzhong Fu"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2164-13-588","first_seen_on":"2012-11-08T00:51:47+00:00","issns":["1471-2164"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1433236200,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/13\/588\/abstract","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/13\/588"],"pmid":"23116153","pubdate":"2012-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microarrays","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Genetics & Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Proteomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"588","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Toward understanding the genetic basis of adaptation to high-elevation life in poikilothermic species: A comparative transcriptomic analysis of two ranid frogs, Rana chensinensis and R. kukunoris\n","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/toward-understanding-genetic-basis-adaptation-highelevation-life-poikilothermic-species-comparative"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.336,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.336},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5180234,"mean":6.1097096327546,"rank":638149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":4541991,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5180234,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85569,"mean":5.7818920157068,"rank":10806,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":74762,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85569,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4697,"mean":3.8222440374787,"rank":490,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":4207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4697,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172,"mean":3.0588304093567,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":154,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
