New and highly sensitive assays for whole-transcriptome microarray analysis of FFPE tissues are now available, but resulting data include noise and variability for which previous expression array methods are inadequate.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006efa","authors":["Curtis Huttenhower","Waldron L","Ogino S","Hoshida Y","Shima K","McCart Reed AE","Simpson PT","Baba Y","Nosho K","Segata N","Vargas AC","Cummings MC","Lakhani SR","Kirkner GJ","Giovannucci E","Quackenbush J","Golub TR","Fuchs CS","Parmigiani G","Huttenhower C"],"doi":"10.1158\/1078-0432.ccr-12-1915","endpage":"6146","first_seen_on":"2012-11-08T12:07:11+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1557-3265","1078-0432"],"issue":"22","journal":"Clinical Cancer Research","last_mentioned_on":1353002145,"links":["http:\/\/clincancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/11\/06\/1078-0432.CCR-12-1915.abstract?papetoc"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/clincancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/11\/06\/1078-0432.CCR-12-1915.full.pdf","pmid":"23136189","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"6136","title":"Expression Profiling of Archival Tumors for Long-term Health Studies","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expression-profiling-archival-tumors-longterm-health-studies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2925899,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1433923,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81480,"mean":5.4679451883308,"rank":49401,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":28837,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81480,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3978,"mean":3.7150118179532,"rank":2900,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":888,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3978,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":6.8,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
