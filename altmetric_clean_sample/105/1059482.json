The development of psychometrically-sound assessment methods for Latino\/as is needed to facilitate eating\/weight research. The current study aimed to evaluate the factor structure of the Spanish-language version of the Eating Disorder Examination (S-EDE) interview, one of the primary assessment methods in studies of eating\/weight despite limited data regarding psychometric aspects of this measure. Participants were 156 Spanish-speaking-only Latino\/as (mean BMI 33.2; 84.6% classified as overweight) who were reliably administered the S-EDE interview by trained bi-lingual doctoral research-clinicians. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed an inadequate fit for the original EDE structure but revealed a good fit for an alternative structure suggested by recent research. CFA supported an 8-item 3-factor structure; the three factors were interpreted as dietary restraint, shape\/weight overvaluation, and body dissatisfaction. These factor analytic findings of the Spanish EDE interview are comparable to recent findings reported for English-speaking obese patient groups and have implications for clinical assessment and research with Latino\/as.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002751","authors":["Grilo CM","Crosby RD","White MA"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.eatbeh.2012.07.006","first_seen_on":"2012-11-10T12:33:55+00:00","issns":["1471-0153"],"issue":"4","journal":"Eating Behaviors","last_mentioned_on":1352669427,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23121800?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC3490131","pmid":"23121800","pubdate":"2012-11-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Studies In Human Society","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Spanish-language Eating Disorder Examination interview: Factor structure in Latino\/as.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/spanishlanguage-eating-disorder-examination-interview-factor-structure-latinoas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":2938184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1426046,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80519,"mean":5.4302137161877,"rank":49717,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":27954,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80519,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":345,"mean":3.8909476744186,"rank":243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":93,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":345,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":4.2827368421053,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
