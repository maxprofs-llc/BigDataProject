In our previous study, ethanolic extracts of the plant demonstrated a marked anti-inflammatory effect in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells (J. Korean Soc. Appl. Biol. Chem., 2010, 53, 275-282). In the present study, capillarisin (CPS), a flavone, main constituent of A. capillaris, was examined for its anti-inflammatory activity in the cells. We found that CPS highly suppressed LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) without exerting cytotoxic effects on RAW 264.7 cells. CPS inhibited the expression of LPS-induced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein and their mRNA in a dose-dependent manner. Also, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1\u03b2, and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) secretion were decreased by CPS in LPS-stimulated macrophages. As a result, CPS inhibited proinflammatory cytokines, iNOS, and COX-2, which is attributed to the suppression of LPS-induced ERK, JNK, and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation. Therefore, we demonstrate here that CPS potentially inhibits the biomarkers related to inflammation through the abrogation of ERK, JNK, and NF-\u03baB p65 activation, and it may be a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5263cf058f610003d7b","authors":["Suckbae Han","Jong Hyun Lee","Chulwon Kim","Dongwoo Nam","Won-Seok Chung","Seok-Geun Lee","Kyoo Seok Ahn","Somi K.
