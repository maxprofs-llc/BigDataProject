This work aimed to produce cell penetrable humanized single domain antibodies (SdAb; VH\/V(H)H) that interfere with the RdRp activity. Recombinant NS5B\u039455 of genotype 3a HCV with de novo RNA synthetic activity was produced and used in phage biopanning for selecting phage clones that displayed NS5B\u039455 bound VH\/V(H)H from a humanized-camel VH\/V(H)H display library. VH\/V(H)H from E. coli transfected with four selected phage clones inhibited RdRp activity when tested by ELISA inhibition using 3'di-cytidylate 25 nucleotide directed in vitro RNA synthesis. Deduced amino acid sequences of two clones showed V(H)H hallmark and were designated V(H)H6 and V(H)H24; other clones were conventional VH, designated VH9 and VH13. All VH\/V(H)H were linked molecularly to a cell penetrating peptide, penetratin. The cell penetrable VH9, VH13, V(H)H6 and V(H)H24 added to culture of Huh7 cells transfected with JHF-1 RNA of genotype 2a HCV reduced the amounts of RNA intracellularly and in culture medium implying that they inhibited the virus replication. VH\/V(H)H mimotopes matched with residues scattered on the polymerase fingers, palm and thumb which were likely juxtaposed to form conformational epitopes. Molecular docking revealed that the antibodies covered the RdRp catalytic groove. The transbodies await further studies for in vivo role in inhibiting HCV replication.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Kanyarat Thueng-in","Jeeraphong Thanongsaksrikul","Potjanee Srimanote","Kunan Bangphoomi","Ornnuthchar Poungpair","Santi Maneewatch","Kiattawee Choowongkomon","Wanpen Chaicumpa"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0049254","first_seen_on":"2012-11-09T01:01:25+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"11","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1352804427,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0049254?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0049254.pdf","pmid":"23145135","pubdate":"2012-11-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e49254","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Cell Penetrable Humanized-VH\/VHH That Inhibit RNA Dependent RNA Polymerase (NS5B) of HCV","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cell-penetrable-humanizedvhvhh-inhibit-rna-dependent-rna-polymerase-ns5b-hcv"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2926676,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1433341,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81052,"mean":5.4569663791934,"rank":49125,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":28707,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81052,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80037,"mean":8.3320977809987,"rank":52739,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":23920,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80037,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4100,"mean":6.5298511832154,"rank":2508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1376,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4100,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
