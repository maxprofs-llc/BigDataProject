We have compared bacterial counts from the ties and shirt pockets of 50 doctors. Counts were higher (P = .002) from ties that were rarely, if ever, cleaned than from shirts that were washed every 2 days or more frequently. The results support the need for further research on unwashable clothing of hospital staff.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005709","authors":["Lopez PJ","Ron O","Parthasarathy P","Soothill J","Spitz L","Pedro-Jose Lopez","Ori Ron","Prabha Parthasarathy","James Soothill","Lewis Spitz"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ajic.2008.09.018","first_seen_on":"2012-11-08T19:49:13+00:00","issns":["0196-6553","01966553","1527-3296"],"issue":"1","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","last_mentioned_on":1465595007,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/19171249\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19171249","http:\/\/www.ajicjournal.org\/article\/S0196-6553(08)00803-1\/abstract"],"pmid":"19171249","pubdate":"2009-01-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Bacterial counts from hospital doctors' ties are higher than those from shirts.","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bacterial-counts-hospital-doctors-ties-higher-those-shirts"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7879571,"mean":6.6725285125901,"rank":635370,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7232439,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7879571,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104863,"mean":5.686908222235,"rank":8753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":95989,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104863,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2055,"mean":10.353478091529,"rank":206,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":1845,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2055,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":5.2762941176471,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
