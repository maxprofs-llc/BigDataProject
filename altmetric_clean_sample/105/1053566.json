Patients often encounter potentially high recurrence rates of pustular eruptions despite multidrug treatment regimens with high morbidity as a consequence. We report a case of generalized pustular psoriasis of Zambusch in a patient whose disease initially flared following early treatment with the anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF-alpha) inhibitor etanercept but was later successfully managed with cyclosporine and reintroduction of etanercept. We also discuss therapeutic management options for generalized pustular psoriasis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007090","authors":["Vine K","Votava HJ","Smith BL"],"first_seen_on":"2012-11-07T13:57:41+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"3","journal":"Cutis","last_mentioned_on":1352295186,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/23094312\/"],"pmid":"23094312","pubdate":"2012-10-27T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Generalized pustular psoriasis of Zambusch: case report of successful disease control with cyclosporine and etanercept.","type":"article","volume":"90","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/generalized-pustular-psoriasis-zambusch-case-report-successful-disease-control-cyclosporine-etanerce"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629179,"mean":4.9362043867828,"rank":2016350,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":938816,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629179,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77730,"mean":5.1712004785859,"rank":37833,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":26864,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77730,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163,"mean":2.9405061728395,"rank":83,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
