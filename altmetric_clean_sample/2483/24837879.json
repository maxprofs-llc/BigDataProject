Gut regeneration seems to be one of the possible mechanism by which this is accomplished. However, the existing information is primarily derived from in vitro studies using mid-gut cell cultures. Present study illustrates cellular and molecular changes in mid-gut epithelium of a Bt-susceptible polyphagous insect pest castor semilooper, Achaea janata in response to a Cry toxin formulation. The present report showed that prolonged exposure to sub-lethal doses of Cry toxin formulation has deleterious effect on larval growth and development. Histological analysis of mid-gut tissue exhibits epithelial cell degeneration, which is due to necrotic form of cell death followed by regeneration through enhanced proliferation of mid-gut stem cells. Cell death is demonstrated by confocal microscopy, flow-cytometry, and DNA fragmentation analysis. Cell proliferation in control vs. toxin-exposed larvae is evaluated by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling and toluidine blue staining. Intriguingly, in situ mRNA analysis detected the presence of arylphorin transcripts in larval mid-gut epithelial cells. Quantitative PCR analysis further demonstrates altered expression of arylphorin gene in toxin-exposed larvae when compared with the control. The coincidence of enhanced mid-gut cell proliferation coincides with the elevated arylphorin expression upon Cry intoxication suggests that it might play a role in the regeneration of mid-gut epithelial cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc19","authors":["Chauhan, Vinod K.","Dhania, Narender K.","Chaitanya, R.
