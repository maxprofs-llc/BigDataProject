Our early study has shown that EsxA exhibits a unique membrane-interacting activity that is not found in its ortholog from non-pathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis. However, the molecular mechanism of EsxA membrane insertion remains unknown. In the present study, we generated the truncated EsxA proteins with deletions of N- and\/or C-terminal flexible arms. Using the fluorescence-based liposome leakage assay, we found the both N- and C-terminal arms were required for membrane disruption. Moreover, we found that upon acidification EsxA converted into a more organized structure with an increased \u03b1-helix content, which was evidenced by circular dichroism analysis and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Finally, using an environment-sensitive fluorescent dye we obtained direct evidence that the central helix-turn-helix motif of EsxA inserted into the membranes and formed a membrane-spanning pore. A model of EsxA membrane insertion was proposed and discussed in the study.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Yue Ma","Verena Keil","Jianjun Sun"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m114.622076","first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T11:22:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1083-351X"],"journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1426252601,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25645924?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/290\/11\/7314.short?rss=1"],"pmid":"25645924","pubdate":"2015-02-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Characterization of Mycobacterium tuberculosis EsxA Membrane Insertion ROLES OF N- AND C-TERMINAL FLEXIBLE ARMS AND CENTRAL HELIX-TURN-HELIX MOTIF","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterization-mycobacterium-tuberculosis-esxa-membrane-insertion-roles-n-cterminal-flexible-arms"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4866623,"mean":5.7967180237154,"rank":2242343,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2500974,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4866623,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173661,"mean":8.5741108142349,"rank":74741,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":93333,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173661,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27448,"mean":2.9375687689001,"rank":18514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":8504,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27448,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":376,"mean":3.409792,"rank":117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":246,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":376,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
