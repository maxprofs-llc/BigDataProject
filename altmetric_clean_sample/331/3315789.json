Recent studies have furthered our understanding of the rapidly advancing field of leukocyte migration, particularly regarding cellular and subcellular events at the level of the venular wall. Furthermore, emerging cellular models are now addressing the transition from an adherent mode to a non-adherent state, incorporating mechanisms that support an efficient migratory profile of leukocytes in the interstitial tissue beyond the venular wall.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f61000316d","authors":["Sussan Nourshargh","Peter L.
