For biological pretreatment, we screened Bacillus subtilis KCTC2023 as a potential lignin-degrading bacterium based on veratryl alcohol (VA) oxidation test and the putative heme-containing dye-decolorizing peroxidase was found in the genome of B. subtilis KCTC2023. The peroxidase from B. subtilis KCTC2023 (BsDyP) was capable of oxidizing various substrates and atypically exhibits substrate-dependent optimum temperature: 30\u00b0C for dyes (Reactive Blue19 and Reactive Black5) and 50\u00b0C for high redox potential substrates (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid [ABTS], VA, and veratryl glycerol-\u03b2-guaiacyl ether [VGE]) over +1.0\u2005V vs. normal hydrogen electrode. At 50\u00b0C, optimum temperature for high redox potential substrates, BsDyP not only showed the highest VA oxidation activity (0.13\u2005Umg(-1)) among the previously reported bacterial peroxidases but also successfully achieved VGE decomposition by cleaving C\u03b1-C\u03b2 bond in the absence of any oxidative mediator with a specific activity of 0.086\u2005Umg(-1) and a conversion rate of 53.5%. Based on our results, BsDyP was identified as the first bacterial peroxidase capable of oxidizing high redox potential lignin-related model compounds, especially VGE, revealing a previously unknown versatility of lignin degrading biocatalyst in nature.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Kyoungseon Min","Gyeongtaek Gong","Han Min Woo","Yunje Kim","Youngsoon Um"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep08245","first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T11:09:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["xxxx-xxxx","2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1423051809,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/srep\/2015\/150204\/srep08245\/full\/srep08245.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/srep08245"],"pmid":"25650125","pubdate":"2015-02-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biocatalysis","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Environmental biotechnology","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Oxidoreductases","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"A dye-decolorizing peroxidase from Bacillus subtilis exhibiting substrate-dependent optimum temperature for dyes and \u03b2-ether lignin dimer","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dyedecolorizing-peroxidase-bacillus-subtilis-exhibiting-substratedependent-optimum-temperature-dyes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4715210,"mean":5.6976580270372,"rank":2343700,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2229853,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4715210,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164528,"mean":8.7703081196403,"rank":78276,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":78603,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164528,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13151,"mean":12.939346159696,"rank":6933,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":5507,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13151,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1018,"mean":14.009150442478,"rank":540,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":427,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1018,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
