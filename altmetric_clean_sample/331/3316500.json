Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan imaging of the brain gives clues to diagnosis but is nonspecific in distinguishing multiple sclerosis from PML. Spinal fluid detection of JC virus is specific but incompletely sensitive. Associated immunosuppression is typically of the cell-mediated type but can be poorly defined on clinical grounds.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f61000829f","authors":["Aksamit AJ"],"doi":"10.1097\/01.nrl.0000250948.04681.96","first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T13:43:59+00:00","issns":["1074-7931"],"issue":"6","journal":"The Neurologist","last_mentioned_on":1207851946,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1097\/01.nrl.0000250948.04681.96","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17122725"],"pmid":"17122725","pubdate":"2006-11-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Review of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and natalizumab.","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/review-progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-natalizumab"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635017,"mean":4.9194226118571,"rank":816005,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295610,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635017,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94861,"mean":8.1446038794013,"rank":24718,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69047,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94861,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126,"mean":2.134288,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":87,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":5.0326666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
