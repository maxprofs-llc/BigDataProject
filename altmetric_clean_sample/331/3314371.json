Traditionally, surgical treatment consisted of debulking that was repeated until no further benefit could be achieved; systemic chemotherapy was sometimes used as a palliative option. Now, visible disease tends to be removed through visceral resections and peritonectomy. To avoid entrapment of tumour cells at operative sites and to destroy small residual mucinous tumour nodules, cytoreductive surgery is combined with intraperitoneal chemotherapy with mitomycin at 42 degrees C. Fluorouracil is then given postoperatively for 5 days. If the mucinous neoplasm is minimally invasive and cytoreduction complete, these treatments result in a 20-year survival of 70%. In the absence of a phase III study, this new combined treatment should be regarded as the standard of care for epithelial appendiceal neoplasms and pseudomyxoma peritonei syndrome.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fd1","doi":"10.1016\/s1470-2045(05)70539-8","first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T12:41:14+00:00","issns":["1470-2045"],"journal":"Lancet Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1172291578,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S1470-2045(05)70539-8","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16389186"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.thelancet.com\/article\/S1470204505705398\/pdf","pmid":"16389186","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"New standard of care for appendiceal epithelial neoplasms and pseudomyxoma peritonei syndrome?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-standard-care-appendiceal-epithelial-neoplasms-pseudomyxoma-peritonei-syndrome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629591,"mean":4.9337473984712,"rank":816385,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290457,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629591,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94113,"mean":8.0861054275759,"rank":24370,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68657,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94113,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2085,"mean":9.9979769673704,"rank":907,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":1073,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2085,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77,"mean":19.324736842105,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
