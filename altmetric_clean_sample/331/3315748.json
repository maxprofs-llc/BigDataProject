The oocyte accomplishes this diverse series of events by establishing an array of signal transduction pathway components that include a select collection of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) that are expressed at levels significantly higher than most other cell types. This array of PTKs includes cytosolic kinases such as SRC-family PTKs (FYN and YES), and FAK kinases, as well as FER. These kinases typically exhibit distinct patterns of localization and in some cases are translocated from one subcellular compartment to another during meiosis. Significant differences exist in the extent to which PTK-mediated pathways are used by oocytes from species that fertilize externally versus internally. The PTK activation profiles as well as calcium signaling pattern seems to correlate with the extent to which a rapid block to polyspermy is required by the biology of each species. Suppression of each of the SRC-family PTKs as well as FER kinase results in failure of meiotic maturation or zygote development, indicating that these PTKs are important for oocyte quality and developmental potential. Future studies will hopefully reveal the extent to which these factors impact clinical assisted reproductive techniques in domestic animals and humans.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081e9","authors":["McGinnis, Lynda K.","Carroll, David J.","Kinsey, William H."],"doi":"10.1002\/mrd.21326","first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T13:19:55+00:00","issns":["1098-2795"],"journal":"Molecular Reproduction and Development","last_mentioned_on":1389211007,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/mrd.21326","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21681843","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3186829"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mrd.21326\/pdf","pmid":"21681843","pubdate":"2011-06-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Protein Tyrosine Kinase Signaling During Oocyte Maturation and Fertilization","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/protein-tyrosine-kinase-signaling-during-oocyte-maturation-fertilization"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3620974,"mean":4.9299989306774,"rank":815936,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2281386,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3620974,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92630,"mean":7.1815566399292,"rank":23490,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68060,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92630,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":327,"mean":1.647773006135,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":239,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":327,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.75,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
