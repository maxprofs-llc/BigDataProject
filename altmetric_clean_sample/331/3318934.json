During this period in the United States, disaster managers and other officials increased emphasis on mitigation relative to response and recovery, especially in programs of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Many other nations and international organizations undertook similar efforts. Beyond the Decade, efforts should focus on improving risk assessments; implementing mitigation strategies; improving technologies supporting warnings and the dissemination of, and response to, warnings; improving the basis for natural disaster insurance; and assisting developing nations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","doi":"10.1126\/science.284.5422.1943","first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T14:59:41+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1095-9203","0036-8075"],"issue":"5422","journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":1371549275,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1126\/science.284.5422.1943","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10373106"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/content\/284\/5422\/1943.full.pdf","pmid":"10373106","pubdate":"1999-06-18T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Mitigation emerges as major strategy for reducing losses caused by natural disasters.
