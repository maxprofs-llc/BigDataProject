Recent technical advances have allowed a better understanding of the cellular and molecular events leading to abscission in isolated yeast or mammalian cells. However, how abscission is regulated in different cell types or in a developing organism remains poorly understood. Here, we characterized the function of the ESCRT-III protein Shrub during cytokinesis in germ cells undergoing a series of complete and incomplete divisions. We found that Shrub is required for complete abscission, and that levels of Shrub are critical for proper timing of abscission. Loss or gain of Shrub delays abscission in germline stem cells (GSCs), and leads to the formation of stem-cysts, where daughter cells share the same cytoplasm as the mother stem cell and cannot differentiate. In addition, our results indicate a negative regulation of Shrub by the Aurora B kinase during GSC abscission. Finally, we found that Lethal giant discs (lgd), known to be required for Shrub function in the endosomal pathway, also regulates the duration of abscission in GSCs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000334a","authors":["Neuza Reis Matias","Juliette Mathieu","Jean-Ren\u00e9 Huynh"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pgen.1004653","first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T11:34:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1553-7404"],"issue":"2","journal":"PLoS Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1423058557,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25647097?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pgen.1004653"],"pmid":"25647097","pubdate":"2015-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Abscission Is Regulated by the ESCRT-III Protein Shrub in Drosophila Germline Stem Cells.","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/abscission-regulated-escrtiii-protein-shrub-drosophila-germline-stem-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6230817,"mean":5.9681223701699,"rank":4382539,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1622858,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6230817,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190071,"mean":8.6438133003632,"rank":119564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":61730,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190071,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4775,"mean":10.748099706745,"rank":3904,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":649,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4775,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177,"mean":7.711,"rank":147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
