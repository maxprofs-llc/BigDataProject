However, the role of OPG in myocardial injury and adverse remodeling in STEMI patients remains unclear. The aims of this observational cohort study were to evaluate: 1) the temporal profile of OPG during STEMI, 2) possible associations between OPG measured acutely and after 4 months, with infarct size, adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling, microvascular obstruction (MVO) and myocardial salvage and 3) the effect of heparin administration on OPG levels.\nBlood samples were drawn repeatedly from 272 STEMI patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) was performed in the acute phase and after 4 months. The effect of heparin administration on OPG levels was studied in 20 patients referred to elective coronary angiography.\nOPG levels measured acutely were significantly higher than Day 1 and during follow-up. OPG levels were correlated with age. No association was found between early OPG levels and CMR measurements at 4 months. Patients with >median OPG levels measured at Day 1 had larger final infarct size, lower LV ejection fraction (LVEF) at 4 months and higher frequency of MVO. There were no associations between OPG and change in end-diastolic volume or myocardial salvage. OPG remained associated with infarct size and LVEF after adjustment for relevant covariates, except peak troponin T and CRP. A 77% increase in OPG levels following heparin administration was found in patients undergoing elective coronary angiography.\nOPG was found to be associated with myocardial injury, but not with LV remodeling or myocardial salvage. The use of OPG as a biomarker in STEMI patients seems to be limited by a strong association with age, confounding effect of heparin administration, and little additive value to established biomarkers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Christian Shetelig","Shanmuganathan Limalanathan","Jan Eritsland","Pavel Hoffmann","Ingebj\u00f8rg Seljeflot","Jon Michael Gran","P\u00e5l Aukrust","Thor Ueland","Geir \u00d8ystein Andersen"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0173034","first_seen_on":"2017-03-05T05:09:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"3","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1488690566,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0173034"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0173034&type=printable","pmid":"28253327","pubdate":"2017-03-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0173034","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Osteoprotegerin levels in ST-elevation myocardial infarction: Temporal profile and association with myocardial injury and left ventricular function","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0173034","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/osteoprotegerin-levels-stelevation-myocardial-infarction-temporal-profile-association-myocardial-inj"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8314034,"mean":7.0059620328577,"rank":6308490,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1125480,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8314034,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241666,"mean":13.72700079035,"rank":176055,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":40521,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241666,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115009,"mean":10.603306848219,"rank":84073,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":18020,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115009,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4487,"mean":11.425954079358,"rank":3194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":769,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4487,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CliniCanHealth\/statuses\/838255109205188609","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16997824],"posted_on":"2017-03-05T05:09:26+00:00","author":{"name":"Rashmi Tiwari-Pandey","url":"http:\/\/www.clinicanhealth.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/881600278012641280\/cKKt0JNM_normal.jpg","description":"PhD, CCRP.
