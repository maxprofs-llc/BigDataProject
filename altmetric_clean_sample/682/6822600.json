The current experiment tested whether cutaneous input from different skin regions across the foot can influence proprioception at the ankle joint. The ability to passively match ankle joint position (17\u00b0 and 7\u00b0 plantarflexion and 7\u00b0 dorsiflexion) was measured while cutaneous vibration was applied to the sole (heel, distal metatarsals) or dorsum of the target foot. Vibration was applied at two different frequencies to preferentially activate Meissner's corpuscles (45Hz, 80\u03bcm) or Pacinian corpuscles (255Hz, 10\u03bcm) at amplitudes ~3dB above mean perceptual thresholds. Results indicated that cutaneous input from all skin regions across the foot could influence joint matching error and variability, although the strongest effects were observed with heel vibration. Furthermore, the influence of cutaneous input from each region was modulated by joint angle; in general, vibration had a limited affect on matching in dorsiflexion compared to matching in plantarflexion. Unlike previous results in the upper limb, we found no evidence that Pacinian input exerted a stronger influence on proprioception compared to Meissner input. Findings from this study suggest that fast adapting cutaneous input from the foot modulates proprioception at the ankle joint in a passive joint matching task. These results indicate that there is interplay between tactile and proprioceptive signals originating from the foot and ankle.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b71","authors":["Robyn L.
