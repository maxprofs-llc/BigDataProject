However, its prevalence and whether it is associated with aspects of training in marathon runners who compete at the elite level is still not clear.\nThe purpose of this research was to assess the prevalence, location and intensity of running-related musculoskeletal pain over the previous 12 months in marathon runners who compete at the elite level and to verify whether certain training characteristics are associated with musculoskeletal pain.\nCross sectional study.\nOne hundred and ninety-nine elite marathon runners were verbally interviewed regarding their personal demographics, training routines, and the presence, location and intensity of musculoskeletal pain.\nThe prevalence of any running-related musculoskeletal pain in elite distance runners was 75%, and the most frequently reported location was the lower leg (19.1%). The presence of pain was independent of age, experience, and volume of training.\nRunning-related musculoskeletal pain is highly prevalent in marathon runners who compete at the elite level.\nStudies about prevalence and location of musculoskeletal pain and factors-related in this population are important to contribute to the development of educational and preventive strategies.\n2.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa67c3cf058f6100097c8","authors":["Renata Nakata Teixeira","Adriana Lunardi","Ronaldo Aparecido da Silva","Alexandre Dias Lopes","Celso R.
