In this study, a thermo-sensitive lipopeptide was designed, consisting of a carbon chain and a leucine zipper with an amino acid sequence CH3-(CH2)4-CO-NH-VAQLEVK-VAQLESK-VSKLESK-VSSLESK-COOH. They could form dimers by the hydrophobic force at body temperature and separate into single random coils above the melting temperature (Tm). The lipopeptide was mixed with phospholipids to form a hybrid liposome (Lipo-LPe). The Tm of the free lipopeptide and lipopeptide in Lipo-LPe was found to be 48.0 \u00b0C and 42.5 \u00b0C from circular dichroism data, respectively. Compared with the pure liposome, the phase-transition temperature (Ttr) of Lipo-LPe, which was obtained by differential scanning calorimetry, was increased by about 5 \u00b0C, showing an improvement of thermal stability. The drug release rate of Lipo-LPe was slightly decreased at body temperature but greatly increased at mild hyperthermia in vitro. Drug release under intermittent heating was performed, and the reversibility of thermo-sensitive on\/off switch was confirmed. Furthermore, Lipo-LPe achieved the maximum amount of cell death under mild hyperthermia. We concluded that Lipo-LPe, as a novel thermo-sensitive drug carrier, provides a promising opportunity for controlling drug release.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008ee3","authors":["Sijia Wang","Yinxing Shen","Junqi Zhang","Shouhong Xu","Honglai Liu"],"doi":"10.1039\/c6cp00378h","endpage":"10137","first_seen_on":"2016-04-19T17:45:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1463-9084"],"issue":"15","journal":"Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics (PCCP)","last_mentioned_on":1461138711,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2016\/CP\/C6CP00378H?utm_content=buffer430fa&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer#!divAbstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2016\/cp\/c6cp00378h","pmid":"27009364","pubdate":"2016-04-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"10129","subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"title":"A designed lipopeptide with a leucine zipper as an imbedded on\/off switch for lipid bilayers","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/designed-lipopeptide-leucine-zipper-imbedded-onoff-switch-lipid-bilayers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7578098,"mean":6.5350293264878,"rank":5467108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1842966,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7578098,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268144,"mean":11.274389396702,"rank":172345,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":80482,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268144,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3556,"mean":2.1784607594937,"rank":1751,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":1680,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3556,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123,"mean":1.7860655737705,"rank":70,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1,"Physics and Astronomy":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"NO":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SamuelFurse\/statuses\/722481259746877442","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6820385],"posted_on":"2016-04-19T17:45:30+00:00","author":{"name":"The Lipid Chronicles","url":"http:\/\/www.thelipidchronicles.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/732491728234516480\/ATilq-y-_normal.jpg","description":"Feed of new #lipid #research covering both structure and signalling.
