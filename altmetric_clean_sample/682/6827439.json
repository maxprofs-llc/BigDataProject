Apart from CNAs involving leukemia-associated genes, recurrent deletions targeting genes not previously implicated in BCP ALL, e.g. INIP, IRF1 and PDE4B, were identified. Deletions of the DNA repair gene INIP were exclusively found in cases with t(12;21), and deletions of SH2B3 were associated with intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21 (p\u2009<\u20090.001). A majority of BTLA deletions (7\/11; 64%) affected samples with gain of 21q chromosome material, suggesting that BTLA deletions are associated with both germline and somatic gain of chromosome 21. In cases without known risk-associated cytogenetic markers, CNAs associated with adverse prognosis were identified in 50% (10\/20), indicating that a majority of these cases could be assigned to distinct genetic subtypes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52d3cf058f610004181","authors":["Ingegerd Ivanov \u00d6fverholm","Ivanov \u00d6fverholm, Ingegerd","Tran, Anh Nhi","Olsson, Linda","Zachariadis, Vasilios","Heyman, Mats","Rudd, Eva","Syk Lundberg, Elisabeth","Nordenskj\u00f6ld, Magnus","Johansson, Bertil","Nordgren, Ann","Barbany, Gisela"],"doi":"10.3109\/10428194.2015.1136740","endpage":"10","first_seen_on":"2016-04-20T05:53:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1042-8194","1029-2403"],"journal":"Leukemia & Lymphoma","last_mentioned_on":1461130641,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.3109\/10428194.2015.1136740"],"pmid":"27090575","pubdate":"2016-04-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"1","subjects":["neoplasms","hematology"],"title":"Detailed gene dose analysis reveals recurrent focal gene deletions in pediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/detailed-gene-dose-analysis-reveals-recurrent-focal-gene-deletions-pediatric-bcell-precursor-acute-l"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7578098,"mean":6.5350293264878,"rank":6562087,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7578098,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267247,"mean":11.2893501493,"rank":224121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267247,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1037,"mean":1.9412876447876,"rank":853,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1037,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":0.94468085106383,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
