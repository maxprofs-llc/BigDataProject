In the present study, the growth, metabolism and ultra-structural changes were evaluated in the aquatic macrophyte, Elodea nuttallii, after exposure to turbulence for 30 days. The turbulence was generated with a vertically oscillating horizontal grid. The turbulence reduced plant growth, plasmolyzed leaf cells and strengthened cell walls, and the plants exposed to turbulence accumulated starch granules in stem chloroplasts. The size of the starch granules increased with the magnitude of the turbulence. Using capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS), an analysis of the metabolome found metabolite accumulation in response to the turbulence. Asparagine was the dominant amino acid that was concentrated in stressed plants, and organic acids such as citrate, ascorbate, oxalate and \u03b3-Amino butyric acid (GABA) also accumulated in response to the turbulence. These results indicated that turbulence caused severe stress that affected plant growth, cell ultra-structure and some metabolic functions of E. nuttallii. Our findings offer insights to explain the effects of water movements on the functions of aquatic plants. This article is protected by copyright.
