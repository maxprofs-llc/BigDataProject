The elaborated reproducible preparation procedure involved copper(II) oleate, iron(III) stearate, and sulfur powder dissolved in oleylamine (OLA) as precursors. The wavelength of the plasmonic resonance maximum could be tuned by changing the Cu\/Fe ratio in the resulting nanocrystals, being the most energetic for the 1:1 ratio (486 nm) and undergoing a bathochromic shift to ca. 1200 nm with an increase to 6:1. LSPR could also be observed in nanocrystals prepared from the same metal precursors and sulfur powder dissolved in 1-octadecene (ODE), provided that the sulfur precursor was taken in excess. Detailed analysis of the reaction mixture by chromatographic techniques, supplemented by mass spectrometry and (1)H NMR spectroscopy enabled the identification of the true chemical nature of the sulfur precursor in S\/OLA, namely, (C18H35NH3(+))(C18H35NH-S8(-)), a reactive product of the reduction of elemental sulfur by the amine groups of OLA. In the case of the S\/ODE precursor, the true precursors are much less reactive primary or secondary thioethers and dialkyl polysulfides.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Grzegorz Gabka"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.6b00912","first_seen_on":"2016-06-14T18:12:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0020-1669","1520-510X"],"issue":"13","journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1465927930,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.6b00912"],"pmid":"27300320","pubdate":"2016-06-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Cu\u2013Fe\u2013S Nanocrystals Exhibiting Tunable Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance in the Visible to NIR Spectral Ranges","type":"article","volume":"55","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cufes-nanocrystals-exhibiting-tunable-localized-surface-plasmon-resonance-visible-nir-spectral-range"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7896890,"mean":6.6848881279648,"rank":6837653,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7896890,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267985,"mean":11.491036770852,"rank":223626,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267985,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8927,"mean":1.1207564418553,"rank":5043,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8927,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":379,"mean":1.0871693121693,"rank":241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":379,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
