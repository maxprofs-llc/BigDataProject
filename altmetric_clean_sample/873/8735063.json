A simulation program with 0.7-mm thickness axial computed tomographic images was used to evaluate facet joint violation by the CPS from C3 to C6. Horizontal and vertical offsets of entry points were measured from 2 different anatomical landmarks on lateral mass, namely the lateral notch and the center of the superior ridge (SR). The transverse and sagittal angles of the screws were also measured. Facet joint violation was evaluated and classified into either \"minor\" (<50% of screw diameter) or \"major\" (\u226550% of screw diameter).\nThe mean transverse and sagittal angles showed no difference between the two groups. However, a more superior vertical offset from the SR in terms of entry point was observed in the degenerative cervical spine group at all levels (P\u200a=\u200a0.001\u200a-\u200a0.026). In addition, facet joint violation was more frequently found in severely degenerated facet joints than in mild to moderately degenerated facet joints (P\u200a=\u200a0.011).\nThe entry point of CPS was moved more superiorly in the degenerative cervical spine in this study, which increased the risk of facet joint violation in our patients. Thus, surgeons need to modify the insertion technique of the CPS or to insert lateral mass screw instead of the CPS when it is considered to insert screws at the uppermost vertebra in the degenerative cervical spine.\n4.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100035a7","authors":["Lee, Dong-Ho","Noh, Hyounmin","Hwang, Chang Ju","Lee, Choon Sung","Abumi, Kuniyoshi","Cho, Jae Hwan"],"doi":"10.1097\/brs.0000000000001730","first_seen_on":"2016-06-14T15:26:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1528-1159","0362-2436"],"issue":"3","journal":"Spine","last_mentioned_on":1485996131,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/spinejournal\/9000\/00000\/A_CT_based_Simulation_Study_to_Compare_the_Risk_of.96008.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/spinejournal\/Abstract\/2017\/02010\/A_CT_Based_Simulation_Study_to_Compare_the_Risk_of.6.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/spinejournal\/9000\/00000\/A_CT_based_Simulation_Study_to_Compare_the_Risk_of.96008.pdf","pmid":"27270642","pubdate":"2016-06-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"A CT-based Simulation Study to Compare the Risk of Facet Joint Violation by the Cervical Pedicle Screw between Degenerative and Non-degenerative Cervical Spines","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/spinejournal\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/A_CT_based_Simulation_Study_to_Compare_the_Risk_of.96008.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ctbased-simulation-study-compare-risk-facet-joint-violation-cervical-pedicle-screw-between-degenerat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8150076,"mean":6.9043957460448,"rank":5899780,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1960535,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8150076,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269961,"mean":11.626679352496,"rank":171501,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":82678,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269961,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4928,"mean":5.8405764156688,"rank":3133,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1483,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4928,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":157,"mean":7.5076923076923,"rank":94,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":157,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2},"mendeley":{"TH":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SpineWebJournal\/statuses\/742739740537946112","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8735063],"posted_on":"2016-06-14T15:25:28+00:00","author":{"name":"Spine","url":"http:\/\/spinejournal.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/761237931545677824\/JkWpUkYc_normal.jpg","description":"Spine is an international, peer-reviewed, bi-weekly periodical that considers for publication original articles in the field of spine.","id_on_source":"SpineWebJournal","tweeter_id":"314148293","geo":{"lt":39.95234,"ln":-75.16379,"country":"US"},"followers":2083},"tweet_id":"742739740537946112"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MBHolistic\/statuses\/826953830478667776","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8735063],"posted_on":"2017-02-02T00:42:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Monterey Holistic","url":"http:\/\/www.montereybayholistic.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/793206537254686724\/_c1aiyQP_normal.jpg","description":"501(c)3 #health #education #exercise #healthnews #nutrition #holistic #fitness #wellness #inspirational #healing #success #quotes #yoga #chiropractic #fitness","id_on_source":"MBHolistic","tweeter_id":"28173797","geo":{"lt":37.25022,"ln":-119.75126,"country":"US"},"followers":28296},"tweet_id":"826953830478667776"}]}}
