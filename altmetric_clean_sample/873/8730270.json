We report the case of a 66-year-old previously healthy man who developed decreased vision due to cobalt-chromium toxicity from a metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty. Our objective was to determine whether the origin of his visual loss was due to toxicity of the optic nerve, of the retina, or of both.\nOcular examination, 10-2 SITA-Standard Humphrey Visual Field (VF), standard full-field electroretinogram (ERG) as indicated by the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV), multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG), multifocal visual evoked potentials (mfVEP), and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were conducted.\nOcular examination revealed decreased visual acuity, poor color vision, normal funduscopy, and cecocentral scotomas on VF testing. Because his right eye was amblyopic since childhood, test results from only the left eye are shown. Electrophysiology studies revealed an ISCEV standard full-field ERG with photopic and scotopic responses within normal limits, mfERG with amplitudes and latencies within normal limits, and mfVEP with latencies within normal limits, but with decreased central amplitudes. Peripapillary and macular OCT showed retinal nerve fiber layer and retinal ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer thickness within normal limits.\nBecause decreased color vision and cecocentral scotoma on 10-2 VF are most consistent with toxic optic neuropathy, and decreased central amplitudes on mfVEP are suggestive of neural dysfunction, we hypothesize that our patient presented with an early stage of optic nerve toxicity that was not yet apparent as a structural abnormality on OCT.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d90","authors":["Grillo, Lola M","Nguyen, Huy V","Tsang, Stephen H","Hood, Donald C","Odel, Jeffrey G","Grillo, Lola M.","Nguyen, Huy V.","Tsang, Stephen H.","Hood, Donald C.","Odel, Jeffrey G."],"doi":"10.1097\/wno.0000000000000400","first_seen_on":"2016-06-14T13:54:51+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1536-5166","1070-8022"],"journal":"Journal of Neuro-Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1465984456,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27295601?dopt=Abstract#pubmed","http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jneuro-ophthalmology\/9000\/00000\/Cobalt_Chromium_Metallosis_With_Normal.99480.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27295601","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["neurology","ophthalmology"],"title":"Cobalt\u2013Chromium Metallosis With Normal Electroretinogram","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jneuro-ophthalmology\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Cobalt_Chromium_Metallosis_With_Normal.99480.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cobaltchromium-metallosis-normal-electroretinogram"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7902020,"mean":6.6891515940364,"rank":5710842,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1909349,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7902020,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268030,"mean":11.492963030119,"rank":171999,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":80538,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268030,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":503,"mean":1.7135537848606,"rank":204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":218,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":503,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":0.91764705882353,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OCTMD\/statuses\/742705004600004608","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8730270],"posted_on":"2016-06-14T13:07:26+00:00","author":{"name":"Brandon Lujan, MD","url":"http:\/\/OCTMD.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/459117248297189376\/n_gr2d1r_normal.jpeg","description":"Medical Retina and Imaging Specialist with Expertise in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT).","id_on_source":"OCTMD","tweeter_id":"244660420","geo":{"lt":37.77493,"ln":-122.41942,"country":"US"},"followers":1320},"tweet_id":"742705004600004608"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/journalneurooph\/statuses\/743018778934415360","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8730270],"posted_on":"2016-06-15T09:54:16+00:00","author":{"name":"journalneuroph","url":"http:\/\/www.jneuro-ophthalmology.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1464463730\/neurooph_normal.jpg","description":"Journal of Neuro-Ophthalmology keeps pace with important advances in all spheres of the neurologic and ophthalmologic sciences.","id_on_source":"journalneurooph","tweeter_id":"339067704","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":57},"tweet_id":"743018778934415360"}]}}
