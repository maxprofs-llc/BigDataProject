Following a comprehensive search of peer-reviewed and grey literature sources, we found that published data on influenza B epidemiology and burden are scarce. Surveillance data show frequent co-circulation of both influenza B lineages during influenza seasons, but little is known about its impact, especially in adults and the clinical burden of influenza B remains unknown. Mismatch between the circulating influenza B lineage and vaccine recommendations has been seen in at least one influenza season in every country. Such observations could impact the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination programs using trivalent vaccines, which contain only one influenza B lineage (B\/Yamagata or B\/Victoria) and highlight the need for local studies to better understand the epidemiology and burden of influenza B in these countries.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9343cf058f61000dea9","authors":["Tafalla, Monica","Buijssen, Marleen","Geets, R\u00e9gine","Vonk Noordegraaf-Schouten, Marije"],"doi":"10.1080\/21645515.2015.1111494","first_seen_on":"2016-02-22T06:00:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2164-554X"],"journal":"Human vaccines immunotherapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1456120866,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26890005?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26890005?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pmid":"26890005","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"A comprehensive review of the epidemiology and disease burden of Influenza B in nine European countries","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comprehensive-review-epidemiology-disease-burden-influenza-b-9-european-countries"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7229418,"mean":6.3648808956484,"rank":5188597,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1785092,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7229418,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284232,"mean":10.38770514124,"rank":182914,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":85144,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284232,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":944,"mean":4.5775270413574,"rank":569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":336,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":944,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":8.6372549019608,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
