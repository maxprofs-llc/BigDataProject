This study presents a trial investigating if stimulation of the two related sensory receptors TRPA1 and TRPM8 could also stimulate the SNS and impact the energetic metabolism of healthy subjects. The trial was designed to be double-blinded, randomized, cross-over, placebo-controlled with healthy subjects and the impact on the energetic metabolism and the autonomic nervous system (ANS) of cinnamaldehyde, capsaicin and a cooling flavor was measured during the 90\u2009min after ingestion. Energy expenditure and substrate oxidation were measured by indirect calorimetry. An exploratory method to measure ANS activity was by facial thermography and power spectral analysis of heart rate variability using ECG was also used. Following cinnamaldehyde ingestion, energy expenditure was increased as compared to placebo. Furthermore, postprandial fat oxidation was maintained higher compared to placebo after cinnamaldehyde and capsaicin ingestion. Similar peripheral thermoregulation was observed after capsaicin and cinnamaldehyde ingestion. Unlike capsaicin, the dose of cinnamaldehyde was not judged to be sensorially 'too intense' by participants suggesting that Cinnamaldehyde would be a more tolerable solution to improve thermogenesis via spicy ingredients as compared to capsaicin.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Michlig, St\u00e9phanie","Merlini, Jenny Meylan","Beaumont, Maurice","Ledda, Mirko","Tavenard, Aude","Mukherjee, Rajat","Camacho, Susana","le Coutre, Johannes","St\u00e9phanie Michlig","Jenny Meylan Merlini","Maurice Beaumont","Mirko Ledda","Aude Tavenard","Rajat Mukherjee","Susana Camacho","Johannes le Coutre"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep20795","first_seen_on":"2016-02-21T18:41:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1459507753,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26883089","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep20795","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/srep20795"],"pmid":"26883089","pubdate":"2016-02-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Fat metabolism","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Molecular medicine","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Effects of TRP channel agonist ingestion on metabolism and autonomic nervous system in a randomized clinical trial of healthy subjects","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-trp-channel-agonist-ingestion-metabolism-autonomic-nervous-system-randomized-clinical-trial"},"altmetric_score":{"score":34.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":34.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7474500,"mean":6.4836868429538,"rank":216940,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":7257306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7474500,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285555,"mean":10.432908192496,"rank":14692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":270846,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285555,"percentile":94},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28337,"mean":14.675183370977,"rank":2307,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":26028,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28337,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3060,"mean":16.570876103302,"rank":292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":2768,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3060,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
