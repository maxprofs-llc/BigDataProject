Serum samples (1727) were collected from Guangzhou city and three rural areas of Guangdong Province, and the prevalence of H. pylori infection was determined using an ELISA. Each subject completed a questionnaire. The overall prevalence of H. pylori infection was 44.2%; a significantly higher prevalence was found in Guangzhou (52.4%) than in the rural areas (38.6%). This difference was generally reflected in the group 0-5 years old, but the rate of increase in seroprevalence for H. pylori over 5 years of age was similar (1%\/year). This study provides important new data on the acquisition of H. pylori, particularly in the early years of life, and shows that density of living conditions is a prime determinant in the acquisition of H. pylori.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002df6","authors":["Mitchell, H M","Li, Y Y","Hu, P J","Liu, Q","Chen, M","Du, G G","Wang, Z J","Lee, A","Hazell, S L","H.
