In 2002, this was released as toxinz\u2122 (University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand), an Internet accessible version. The objective of this study is to describe New Zealand subscriber utilisation of TOXINZ with an emphasis on pharmaceutical monographs viewed.\nA retrospective review was conducted of records of New Zealand subscriber access to TOXINZ monographs during the period 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2012. Telephone enquiry data to the New Zealand National Poisons Centre was also obtained for the same time period.\nOver the decade, 201\u2009255 TOXINZ monographs were accessed, with annual numbers of documents viewed doubling from 13\u2009718 in 2003 to 28\u2009782 in 2012. Pharmaceuticals were the largest group viewed with 132\u2009316 documents accessed (65.7% of all documents), followed by monographs relating to chemicals 46\u2009061 (22.9%), substances of abuse 6698 (3.3%), plants 6563 (3.3%), supportive care 4668 (2.3%), animals 2553 (1.3%), and other 2396 (1.2%). In regard to the pharmaceuticals, high or rapidly increasing levels of enquiries were identified for venlafaxine, quetiapine, paracetamol, zopiclone and tramadol. Investigation of telephone enquiries to the New Zealand National Poisons Centre showed total poisoning calls increased slightly over the 10\u2009year period, whereas telephone enquiries from hospitals halved.\nThe TOXINZ Internet accessible poisons information database has proved to be a well-utilised addition to the New Zealand National Poisons Centre's service.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027ba","authors":["Fountain, John S","Slaughter, Robin J"],"doi":"10.1111\/1742-6723.12594","first_seen_on":"2016-05-10T14:51:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1742-6723"],"journal":"Emergency Medicine Australasia","last_mentioned_on":1462890407,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27157681?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27157681","pubdate":"2016-05-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["emergencymedicine"],"title":"TOXINZ, the New Zealand Internet poisons information database: The first decade","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/toxinz-new-zealand-internet-poisons-information-database-first-decade"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7679268,"mean":6.5932591477757,"rank":3008417,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4615033,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7679268,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267538,"mean":11.429079551613,"rank":96684,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":168550,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267538,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":736,"mean":7.0645578231293,"rank":439,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":295,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":736,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":5.2335714285714,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Unspecified":1,"Chemical Engineering":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2},"mendeley":{"PL":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/autotwollow\/statuses\/730033433854906368","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7322340],"posted_on":"2016-05-10T13:55:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Martha","url":"http:\/\/j.gs\/1IBb","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1099613290\/f89f4_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"autotwollow","tweeter_id":"176697548","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2950},"tweet_id":"730033433854906368"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/bcastbloggers\/statuses\/730041386557276165","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7322340],"posted_on":"2016-05-10T14:26:44+00:00","author":{"name":"Mary","url":"http:\/\/j.gs\/1GEW","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1393246488\/broadcastblogger_normal.jpg","description":"Connecting Bloggers with Businesses!","id_on_source":"bcastbloggers","tweeter_id":"297626036","geo":{"lt":40.71427,"ln":-74.00597,"country":"US"},"followers":1533},"tweet_id":"730041386557276165"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/internetmoms\/statuses\/730041399928750080","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7322340],"posted_on":"2016-05-10T14:26:47+00:00","author":{"name":"joanna","url":"http:\/\/q.gs\/1bRsC","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1096759530\/MVC-026S_normal.jpg","description":"Parenting, motherhood !","id_on_source":"internetmoms","tweeter_id":"68739848","geo":{"lt":40.76078,"ln":-111.89105,"country":"US"},"followers":2486},"tweet_id":"730041399928750080"}]}}
