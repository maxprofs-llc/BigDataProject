In such cases, TNF-inhibitors may be prescribed. However, monoclonal antibodies with the Fc moiety are actively transported across the placenta, resulting in therapeutic drug levels in the newborn. As certolizumab (CZP) lacks the Fc moiety, it may bear a lower risk for the child.\nWe report a case series of thirteen patients (5 with rheumatoid arthritis and 8 with spondyloarthritis) treated with CZP during late pregnancy to control disease activity. CZP measured in cord blood of eleven infants ranged between undetectable levels and 1\u03bcg\/mL whereas the median CZP level of maternal plasma was 32.97\u03bcg\/mL.\nThree women developed an infection during the third trimester, of whom one had a severe infection and one had an infection that resulted in a pre-term delivery. During the postpartum period, 6 patients remained on CZP while breastfeeding. CZP levels in the breast milk of two breastfeeding patients were undetectable.\nThe lack of the active transplacental transfer of CZP gives the possibility to treat inflammatory arthritis during late gestation without potential harm to the newborn. However, in pregnant women treated with TNF-inhibitors and prednisone, attention should be given to the increased susceptibility to infections, which might cause prematurity. CZP treatment can be continued while breastfeeding.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c46","authors":["F\u00f6rger, Frauke","Zbinden, Astrid","Villiger, Peter M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jbspin.2015.07.004","endpage":"343","first_seen_on":"2016-05-10T14:20:18+00:00","issns":["1778-7254","1297319X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Joint Bone Spine","last_mentioned_on":1463105929,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/?term=26617214&utm_content=buffer81ac2&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmid":"26617214","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"341","subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"Certolizumab treatment during late pregnancy in patients with rheumatic diseases: Low drug levels in cord blood but possible risk for maternal infections.
