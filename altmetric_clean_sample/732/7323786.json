There is minimal research on this population, yet a synthesis of related theory, research, and practice on spoken-language bilinguals can be used to add to the body of knowledge on these learners. Specifically, the author reports on three major areas: (a) population characteristics of DMLs, (b) theories relevant to understanding the language development of DMLs, and (c) considerations for programs in designing and implementing educational services for DMLs. In the interest of ensuring that children receive the foundation for linguistic success, aspects of linguistically responsive teaching (Lucas &amp; Villegas, 2013) are addressed, with a focus on adopting an asset-based perspective on educating DMLs that honors all of a child's language, identity, and cultural memberships.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021db","authors":["Lianna Pizzo"],"doi":"10.1353\/aad.2016.0017","endpage":"32","first_seen_on":"2016-05-10T15:36:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1543-0375","0002-726X"],"issue":"1","journal":"American Annals of the Deaf","last_mentioned_on":1491922293,"links":["https:\/\/muse.jhu.edu\/article\/615742#.VzH-tPvIbVA.twitter"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/muse.jhu.edu\/article\/615742\/summary","pmid":"27156915","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Gallaudet University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Specialist Studies In Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Linguistics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Health Professions","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"17","subjects":["audiology"],"title":"d\/Deaf and Hard of Hearing Multilingual Learners: The Development of Communication and Language","type":"article","volume":"161","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ddeaf-hard-hearing-multilingual-learners-development-communication-language"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0.85,"6m":0.85,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8058252,"mean":6.8390091159945,"rank":3585045,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4384305,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8058252,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270331,"mean":11.535340561536,"rank":113313,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":153196,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270331,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99,"mean":2.0371224489796,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Social Sciences":2,"Psychology":5,"Computer Science":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HearingLibrary\/statuses\/730057614210568193","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7323786],"posted_on":"2016-05-10T15:31:13+00:00","author":{"name":"Hearing Libraries","url":"http:\/\/www.ucl.ac.uk\/library\/sites\/ear-institute","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1620447127\/librarysqsmall_normal.jpg","description":"The UCL Ear Institute and Action on Hearing Loss Libraries are a collaboration between @ucl,  @ActionOnHearing & @uclh, for ENT Medicine & Hearing Loss.","id_on_source":"HearingLibrary","tweeter_id":"399374353","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1611},"tweet_id":"730057614210568193"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ProjectMUSE\/statuses\/730060301903663106","license":"gnip","rt":["HearingLibrary"],"citation_ids":[7323786],"posted_on":"2016-05-10T15:41:54+00:00","author":{"name":"Project MUSE","url":"http:\/\/muse.jhu.edu","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/666272833740382209\/PbGmBgAl_normal.jpg","description":"Project MUSE offers digital full-text access to humanities and social science scholarship from leading university presses and scholarly publishers.","id_on_source":"ProjectMUSE","tweeter_id":"19000141","geo":{"lt":39.29038,"ln":-76.61219,"country":"US"},"followers":12510},"tweet_id":"730060301903663106"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/agnessarolta\/statuses\/851809954386374656","license":"gnip","rt":["HearingLibrary"],"citation_ids":[7323786],"posted_on":"2017-04-11T14:51:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Agnes Fazekas","url":"https:\/\/hu.linkedin.com\/pub\/agnes-sarolta-fazekas\/25\/997\/21b","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/775784397534527488\/opRTlwMe_normal.jpg","description":"Ph.D Fellow #HigherEd #Access #Disability | Board Mb @ENILYouth| Mb @ACoY_CoE | worked @aheadireland | ACCESS EC @TheEAIE @ExchangeAbility Partnerships 2013\/14","id_on_source":"agnessarolta","tweeter_id":"180052625","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":738},"tweet_id":"851809954386374656"}]}}
