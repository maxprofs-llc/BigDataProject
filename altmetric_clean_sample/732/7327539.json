Little is known regarding the influence that leg preference or playing position may have on lower-extremity muscular strength and asymmetry. The purpose of this study was to investigate lower-extremity strength profiles in rugby union athletes and compare isokinetic knee and hip strength variables between legs and positions.\nThirty male academy rugby union athletes, separated into forwards (n=15) and backs (n=15), participated in this cross-sectional analysis. Isokinetic dynamometry was used to evaluate peak torque, angle of peak torque and strength ratios of the preferred and non-preferred legs during seated knee-extension\/flexion and supine hip-extension\/flexion at 60\u00b0\u00b7s-1.\nBacks were older (ES=1.6) but smaller in stature (ES=-0.47) and body-mass (ES=-1.3) compared to the forwards. The non-preferred leg was weaker than the preferred leg for forwards during extension (ES=-0.37) and flexion (ES=-0.21) actions and for backs during extension (ES=-0.28) actions. Backs were weaker at the knee than forwards in the preferred leg during extension (ES=-0.50) and flexion (ES=-0.66) actions. No differences were observed in strength ratios between legs or position. Backs produced peak torque at longer muscle lengths in both legs at the knee (ES=-0.93 to -0.94) and hip (ES=-0.84 to -1.17) compared to the forwards.\nIn this sample of male academy rugby union athletes, the preferred leg and forwards displayed superior strength compared to the non-preferred leg and backs. These findings highlight the importance of individualised athletic assessments to detect crucial strength differences in male rugby union athletes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079e4","authors":["Scott R Brown","Matt Brughelli","Lee A Bridgeman"],"doi":"10.1123\/ijspp.2015-0241","first_seen_on":"2016-05-10T20:07:21+00:00","issns":["1555-0273"],"issue":"4","journal":"International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance","last_mentioned_on":1462975953,"links":["https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/281682538_Profiling_Isokinetic_Strength_by_Leg_Preference_and_Position_in_Rugby_Union_Athletes"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Scott_Brown12\/publication\/281682538_Profiling_Isokinetic_Strength_by_Leg_Preference_and_Position_in_Rugby_Union_Athletes\/links\/57323ba508ae9ace84047cca.pdf","pmid":"26356050","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["physiology","sportsmedicine"],"title":"Profiling Isokinetic Strength by Leg Preference and Position in Rugby Union Athletes","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/profiling-isokinetic-strength-leg-preference-position-rugby-union-athletes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7684314,"mean":6.5948576928038,"rank":1570601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6103578,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7684314,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267572,"mean":11.430450130993,"rank":73141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":193864,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267572,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":805,"mean":11.173077114428,"rank":381,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":415,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":805,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":9.7730769230769,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
