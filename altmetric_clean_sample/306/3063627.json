This presents a serious challenge for the more traditional mathematical approaches that assume component homogeneity to relate system observables using mathematical equations. While the homogeneity condition does not lead to loss of accuracy while simulating various continua, it fails to offer detailed solutions when applied to systems with dynamically interacting heterogeneous components. As the functionality and architecture of most biological systems is a product of multi-faceted individual interactions at the sub-system level, continuum models rarely offer much beyond qualitative similarity. Agent-based modelling is a class of algorithmic computational approaches that rely on interactions between Turing-complete finite-state machines-or agents-to simulate, from the bottom-up, macroscopic properties of a system. In recognizing the heterogeneity condition, they offer suitable ontologies to the system components being modelled, thereby succeeding where their continuum counterparts tend to struggle. Furthermore, being inherently hierarchical, they are quite amenable to coupling with other computational paradigms. The integration of any agent-based framework with continuum models is arguably the most elegant and precise way of representing biological systems. Although in its nascence, agent-based modelling has been utilized to model biological complexity across a broad range of biological scales (from cells to societies). In this article, we explore the reasons that make agent-based modelling the most precise approach to model biological systems that tend to be non-linear and complex.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002432","authors":["Himanshu Kaul","Yiannis Ventikos","Kaul H","Ventikos Y"],"doi":"10.1093\/bib\/bbt077","endpage":"152","first_seen_on":"2015-01-14T06:38:39+00:00","issns":["1477-4054","1467-5463"],"issue":"1","journal":"Briefings in Bioinformatics","last_mentioned_on":1499249485,"links":["http:\/\/bib.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/16\/1\/137.short?rss=1","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4293376\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bib.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/16\/1\/137.full.pdf","pmid":"24227161","pubdate":"2013-11-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Computation Theory And Mathematics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Computer Science"],"startpage":"137","subjects":["computationalbiology"],"title":"Investigating biocomplexity through the agent-based paradigm","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/investigating-biocomplexity-through-agentbased-paradigm"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8166903,"mean":6.9134132553505,"rank":5911656,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1964533,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8166903,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240958,"mean":8.0267126084738,"rank":147581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":80438,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240958,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":715,"mean":6.036380952381,"rank":587,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":92,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":715,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":3.6664,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
