This paper reports on the change in health profiles for over 90 traits, measured in 382 participants over three visits in the 12 months following enrolment. Significant changes in the desired direction of improved health are observed for many traits related to cardiovascular health, including BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol, and arterial stiffness, as well as for summary measures of physical and mental health. The changes are most notable for individuals in the upper quartile of baseline risk, many of whom showed a positive correlated response across clinical categories. By contrast, individuals who start with more healthy profiles do not generally show significant improvements and only a modest impact of targeting specific health attributes was observed. Overall, the CHDWB model shows promise as an effective intervention particularly for individuals at high risk for cardiovascular disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef652a83ee09648b4f08","authors":["Rubina Tabassum"],"doi":"10.3390\/jpm4040489","first_seen_on":"2015-01-15T16:51:47+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms"],"issns":["2075-4426",""],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Personalized Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1422648354,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2075-4426\/4\/4\/489","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4282885\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2075-4426\/4\/4\/489\/pdf","pmid":"25563459","pubdate":"2014-12-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","title":"A Longitudinal Study of Health Improvement in the Atlanta CHDWB Wellness Cohort","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/longitudinal-study-health-improvement-atlanta-chdwb-wellness-cohort"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036026,"mean":5.9656490211997,"rank":3343687,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1485462,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036026,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186742,"mean":8.2588517465367,"rank":118302,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":59810,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186742,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":4.9674915254237,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":5.0537142857143,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
