In this study, several analytical techniques including NMR, FT-ICR, MALDI-MS, LC-MS and UV\/Vis are used to study the copper-Rifampicin-Polyethylene glycol (PEG-3350) complex. The copper (II) cation is a carrier for the antibiotic Rifampicin as well as nutrients for the bacterium. The NIH-NIAID cell line containing several Tb strains (including antibiotic resistant strains) is tested against seven copper-PEG-RIF complex variations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f2","authors":["Manning T","Mikula R","Wylie G","Phillips D","Jarvis J","Zhang F"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bmcl.2014.12.053","first_seen_on":"2015-01-15T08:56:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0960-894X"],"issue":"","journal":"Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters","last_mentioned_on":1421251988,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25575660?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25575660","pubdate":"2015-01-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"title":"Structural measurements and cell line studies of the copper-PEG-Rifampicin complex against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bioorganic-medicinal-chemistry-letters-structural-measurements-cell-line-studies-copper-peg-rifampic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4734919,"mean":5.4827829794683,"rank":3858310,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":122878,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4734919,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":166428,"mean":8.3807090916739,"rank":132204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":610,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":166428,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1671,"mean":2.1943640718563,"rank":1215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1671,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":1.1453658536585,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AntibioticResis\/status\/555397209416400896","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3067210],"posted_on":"2015-01-14T16:13:08+00:00","author":{"name":"AntibioticResistance","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/551766191962746880\/GlO2QteM_normal.jpeg","description":"Keep abreast of the latest developments in the fight against Antibiotic Resistance #AMR with the latest publications curated from PubMed.
