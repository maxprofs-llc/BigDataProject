However, limited data exist regarding the prognostic significance of SIR in bladder cancer. We investigate the utility of pretreatment SIR in patients with urothelial carcinoma undergoing radical cystectomy.Methods:The study cohort consisted of 419 patients with a median follow-up of 37.7 months. The SIRs used for each described prognostic nomogram are consistent with previously published data: C-reactive protein, albumin, white cell count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, and platelet count. Primary end point was disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) after surgery. Cox regression models were used to determine the time to disease-specific and overall mortality. Multivariate regression coefficients of the predictors were used to develop nomograms for predicting 5-year DSS and OS probability.Results:Multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed that albumin, lymphocyte count, and platelet count were significantly associated with a significantly increased risk for death from bladder cancer. The nomograms including each index were developed to predict the probability of 5-year DSS and OS after radical cystectomy. The C statistics were 77.8% and 77.3%, respectively, and exceeded the 2002 AJCC (72.0% and 70.3%, respectively). In the decision curve analyses, the nomograms including SIR demonstrated higher net benefit gains compared with the models without SIR.Conclusions:Cellular components of SIR have better prognostic values compared with acute-phase protein in patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 13 January 2015; doi:10.1038\/bjc.2014.631 www.bjcancer.com.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000243d","authors":["J H Ku","M Kang","H S Kim","C W Jeong","C Kwak","H H Kim"],"doi":"10.1038\/bjc.2014.631","first_seen_on":"2015-01-14T23:15:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0007-0920","1532-1827"],"journal":"British Journal of Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1459814400,"links":["http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/bjc\/rss\/aop\/~3\/n45p3q2v1hs\/bjc.2014.631","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/bjc.2014.631"],"pmid":"25584490","pubdate":"2015-01-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"The prognostic value of pretreatment of systemic inflammatory responses in patients with urothelial carcinoma undergoing radical cystectomy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prognostic-value-pretreatment-systemic-inflammatory-responses-patients-urothelial-carcinoma-undergoi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7779875,"mean":6.6346658333997,"rank":751177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7004068,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7779875,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237744,"mean":7.8775399486001,"rank":28933,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":208012,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237744,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3991,"mean":8.9452360902256,"rank":741,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":3174,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3991,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110,"mean":16.661431192661,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
