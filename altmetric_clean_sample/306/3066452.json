However, no patients with FTD, to date, have been reported to be able to learn how to play a musical instrument after disease onset. Herein we describe a patient (J. K.) who had never played any musical instruments premorbidly, but who learned to play the saxophone after being diagnosed with a behavioral variant of FTD. He mastered a repertoire that consisted of 10 pieces of Korean folk songs over a period of three years. Furthermore, his saxophone skills were high enough to outperform other students in his class.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d83cf058f6100013ac","authors":["Hanna Cho","Cho H","Chin J","Suh MK","Kim HJ","Kim YJ","Ye BS","Lee NK","Kim EJ","Seo SW","Na DL"],"doi":"10.1080\/13554794.2014.992915","first_seen_on":"2015-01-15T03:14:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1355-4794","1465-3656"],"issue":"6","journal":"Neurocase","last_mentioned_on":1427419385,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/13554794.2014.992915","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/13554794.2014.992915#.VM9mdWSG_Ue","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/13554794.2014.992915","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1080\/13554794.2014.992915","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/13554794.2014.992915#.VRLA5pOsVM4","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25587661"],"pmid":"25587661","pubdate":"2015-01-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychology","psychiatry","behavioralsciences","neurology"],"title":"Postmorbid learning of saxophone playing in a patient with frontotemporal dementia.","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/postmorbid-learning-saxophone-playing-patient-frontotemporal-dementia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":57.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":57.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8149094,"mean":6.9041563322382,"rank":154102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":7994956,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8149094,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251056,"mean":7.9435150943021,"rank":6228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":244821,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251056,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":322,"mean":13.694031152648,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":303,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":322,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.95,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
