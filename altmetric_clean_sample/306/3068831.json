The majority of tumors have evolved mechanisms that allow for successful evasion of these immune responses. Recognition of these evasive processes led to development of immunotherapeutic antibodies targeting the co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory receptors on T cells, with the goal of enhancement of T cell activation or reversal of tumor-induced T cell inhibition. Several of these agents, such as antibodies targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) have already demonstrated significant promise in clinical trials. Clinical benefit of these antibodies as single agents, however, has been limited to a subset of patients and has not been observed in all tumor types. These limitations call for development of rational combination strategies aiming to extend therapeutic benefit to a broader range of patients. These include: 1) modalities that enhance antigen presentation, such as radiation, cryotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted agents, vaccines, toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, type I interferon, and oncolytic viruses; 2) additional agents aiming to reverse T cell dysfunction, such as other immune checkpoint inhibitors; and 3) agents targeting other immune inhibitory mechanisms, such as inhibitors of indoleamine dioxygenase (IDO), regulatory T cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). It is becoming increasingly evident that the efficacy of specific combinations will likely not be universal and that the choice of a treatment modality may need to be tailored to fit the needs of each individual patient.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032e1","authors":["Dmitriy Zamarin","Michael A Postow"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pharmthera.2015.01.003","first_seen_on":"2015-01-15T16:15:47+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1879-016X"],"journal":"Pharmacology & Therapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1455047255,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25583297?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25583297","pubdate":"2015-01-09T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Immune checkpoint modulation: Rational design of combination strategies.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/immune-checkpoint-modulation-rational-design-combination-strategies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7156405,"mean":6.3086437613049,"rank":2877588,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4175010,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7156405,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242621,"mean":7.6728407303603,"rank":84524,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":153586,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242621,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":636,"mean":3.5109354330709,"rank":342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":286,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":636,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":8.8906666666667,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":44,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
