Previous studies have indicated that microRNA (miR)\u2011146b\u20115p is involved in the inhibition of proliferation and metastasis of numerous human cancer types. The aim of the present study was to explore the inhibitory effect of miR\u2011156b\u20115p on the proliferation and metastatic potential of Caski human cervical cancer cells, as well as to determine the mechanisms by which it proceeds. The results demonstrated that miR\u2011146b\u20115p was able to inhibit the proliferative, invasive and adhesive potential and block the cell cycle progression of Caski human cervical cancer cells, as determined using MTS and transwell assays as well as flow cytometry. Furthermore, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis revealed that transfection with miR\u2011146b\u20115p decreased the mRNA and protein expression levels of C\u2011X\u2011C chemokine receptor type\u00a04, matrix metalloproteinase\u20112 and\u00a0\u20119, c\u2011Myc, cyclin\u00a0D1 and human papilloma virus\u00a016. In addition, the secretion levels of transforming growth factor\u2011\u03b2, monocyte chemoattractant protein\u20111 and tumor necrosis factor\u2011\u03b1, the telomerase activity, the phosphorylation of c\u2011Jun N\u2011terminal protein kinase and protein kinase\u00a0B and the transcriptional activities of nuclear factor\u2011\u03baB, signal transducer and activator of transcription\u20113 and \u20115 were reduced. However, increased levels of p27 and p53 were detected in the miR\u2011146b\u20115p\u2011overexpressing Caski cells. These results indicate that miR\u2011146b\u20115p may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cervical cancer through regulation of cell chemotaxis and the cell cycle.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c8","authors":["Cuiping Shen","Hui Yang","Hong Liu","Xiuqin Wang","Youzhong Zhang","Rui Xu"],"doi":"10.3892\/mmr.2015.3151","first_seen_on":"2015-01-14T18:38:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1791-3004"],"journal":"Molecular Medicine Reports","last_mentioned_on":1421260625,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25572123?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25572123","pubdate":"2015-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Inhibitory effect and mechanisms of microRNA-146b-5p on the proliferation and metastatic potential of Caski human cervical cancer cells.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inhibitory-effect-mechanisms-microrna146b5p-proliferation-metastatic-potential-caski-human-cervical"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4734919,"mean":5.4827829794683,"rank":3858310,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":122879,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4734919,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159072,"mean":8.5395344971743,"rank":126466,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":596,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159072,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1243,"mean":1.0526843800322,"rank":655,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1243,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148,"mean":0.8890612244898,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Physics and Astronomy":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"AR":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/microRNA_papers\/status\/555433437377466369","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3065231],"posted_on":"2015-01-14T18:37:05+00:00","author":{"name":"microRNApapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/509340649733517312\/5SbSeX5X_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for microRNA papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ.
