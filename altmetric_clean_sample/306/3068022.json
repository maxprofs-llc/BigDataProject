Mass spectrometry identified 175 proteins in human T-cell nucleolar extracts that bound to sepharose-immobilized H1 in vitro. Gene ontology analysis found significant enrichment for H1 binding proteins with functions related to nucleolar chromatin structure and RNA polymerase I transcription regulation, rRNA processing, and mRNA splicing. Consistent with the affinity binding results, H1 existed in large (400 to >650kDa) macromolecular complexes in human T cell nucleolar extracts. To complement the biochemical experiments, the effects of in vivo H1 depletion on protein content and structural integrity of the nucleolus were investigated using the H1 triple isoform knock out (H1\u0394TKO) mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) model system. Proteomic profiling of purified wild type mESC nucleoli identified a total of 613 proteins, only ~60% of which were detected in the H1 mutant nucleoli. Within the affected group, spectral counting analysis quantitated 135 specific nucleolar proteins whose levels were significantly altered in H1\u0394TKO mESC. Importantly, the functions of the affected proteins in mESC closely overlapped with those of the human T cell nucleolar H1 binding proteins. Immunofluorescence microscopy of intact H1\u0394TKO mESC demonstrated both a loss of nucleolar RNA content and altered nucleolar morphology resulting from in vivo H1 depletion. We conclude that H1 organizes and maintains an extensive protein-protein interaction network in the nucleolus required for nucleolar structure and integrity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e5c","authors":["Heather J Szerlong","Jacob A Herman","Christine M Krause","Jennifer G DeLuca","Arthur Skoultchi","Quinton A Winger","Jessica E Prenni","Jeffrey C Hansen","Szerlong HJ","Herman JA","Krause CM","DeLuca JG","Skoultchi A","Winger QA","Prenni JE","Hansen JC"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jmb.2015.01.001","endpage":"2071","first_seen_on":"2015-01-15T12:36:36+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci","nigms"],"issns":["1089-8638","0022-2836","00222836"],"issue":"11","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1421323744,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25584861?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25584861","pubdate":"2015-01-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"2056","subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Proteomic characterization of the nucleolar linker histone H1 interaction network.","type":"article","volume":"427","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/proteomic-characterization-nucleolar-linker-histone-h1-interaction-network-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4739474,"mean":5.4857892300663,"rank":3266305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":877131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4739474,"percentile":18},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":166629,"mean":8.3693363900426,"rank":113701,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":34303,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":166629,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3728,"mean":2.5001143010464,"rank":2939,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":611,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3728,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":1.2295454545455,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
