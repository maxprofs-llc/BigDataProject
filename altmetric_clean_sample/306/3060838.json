Calcium release from intracellular compartments is peculiarly inhibited by external calcium in a calcineurin-independent and Cch1-, but not Mid1-, driven manner. HTS-induced calcium release is also negatively regulated by the ER protein Cls2 and involves a poorly characterized protein, FLC2\/YAL053W gene product, previously proposed to be required for FAD transport in the ER, albeit, due to its molecular features, it was also previously classified as an ion transporter. A computational analysis revealed that this gene and its three homologs in S. cerevisiae, together with previously identified Schizosaccharomyces pombe pkd2 and Neurospora crassa calcium-related spray protein, belong to a fungal branch of TRP-like ion transporters related to human mucolipin and polycystin 2 calcium transporters. Moreover, disruption of FLC2 gene confers severe sensitivity to Calcofluor white and hyper-activation of the cell wall integrity MAPK cascade, suggesting a role in cell wall maintenance as previously suggested for the fission yeast homolog. Perturbation in cytosolic resting calcium concentration and hyper-activation of calcineurin in exponentially growing cells suggest a role for this transporter in calcium homeostasis in yeast.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e16","authors":["M Rigamonti","S Groppi","F Belotti","R Ambrosini","G Filippi","E Martegani","R Tisi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ceca.2014.12.003","first_seen_on":"2015-01-13T11:54:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-1991"],"journal":"Cell Calcium","last_mentioned_on":1445598364,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25573187?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25573187","pubdate":"2014-12-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","cellbiology"],"title":"Hypotonic stress-induced calcium signaling in Saccharomyces cerevisiae involves TRP-like transporters on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hypotonic-stressinduced-calcium-signaling-saccharomyces-cerevisiae-involves-trplike-transporters-end"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6391435,"mean":5.9810902648762,"rank":2815831,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3405456,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6391435,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":204279,"mean":8.1782882444513,"rank":94017,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":101520,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":204279,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":276,"mean":1.9183490909091,"rank":101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":156,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":276,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.6113636363636,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
