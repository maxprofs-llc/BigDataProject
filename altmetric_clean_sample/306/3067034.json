Before a symbiotic infection the organ has elaborate epithelial structures covered with cilia and microvilli that are involved in the transfer of bacteria to the incipient symbiotic tissue. These structures regressed within days following infection; however, they were retained in uninfected animals, suggesting that the initiation of symbiosis influences, and is perhaps a prerequisite for, the normal developmental program of the juvenile host.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"1991Sci...254.1491M","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["MJ McFall-Ngai","EG Ruby"],"doi":"10.1126\/science.1962208","first_seen_on":"2015-01-15T07:49:11+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1095-9203","0036-8075"],"issue":"5037","journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":1421193600,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1126\/science.1962208","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1962208"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/content\/254\/5037\/1491.full.pdf","pmid":"1962208","pubdate":"1991-12-06T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Symbiont recognition and subsequent morphogenesis as early events in an animal-bacterial mutualism.","type":"article","volume":"254","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/symbiont-recognition-subsequent-morphogenesis-early-events-animalbacterial-mutualism"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4729227,"mean":5.5465942099605,"rank":319929,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":4404563,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4729227,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":166243,"mean":8.4218843974448,"rank":16418,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":149723,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":166243,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31124,"mean":25.882746072037,"rank":9369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":21616,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31124,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":527,"mean":105.53136882129,"rank":378,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":147,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":527,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":10,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":22,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
