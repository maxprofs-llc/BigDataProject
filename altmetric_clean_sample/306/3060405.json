However, noticeable limitations of insufficient supply and reduction of differentiation potential impact the feasibility of their clinical application. This study investigated the in vitro function of steroids and gender differences on the proliferation and differentiation of rat MSCs. Bone marrow MSCs of age-matched rats were exposed to proliferation and osteogenic differentiation media supplements with various concentrations of 17beta-estradiol (E2) and dexamethasone. Cell proliferation was measured by MTS assay; osteogenic markers and steroid-associated growth factors and receptors were evaluated by ELISA and real-time PCR. The results revealed that supplements of E2 and dexamethasone increase MSC proliferation in a biphasic manner. The optimal dose and interaction of steroids required to improve MSC proliferation effectively varied depending on the gender of donors. Supplementation of E2 effectively improves osteogenic differentiation markers including ALP, osteocalcin and calcium levels for MSCs isolated from both male and female donors. The mRNA of TGF-beta1 and BMP-7 are also up-regulated. However, effective doses to maximally improve osteogenic potentials and growth factors for MSCs are different between male and female donors. The relationship between steroid receptors, osteogenic markers and cytokines are also varied by genders. The outcomes of the present study strongly indicate that steroids potentially function as an effective modulator to improve the capacity of MSCs in bone regeneration. It provides crucial information for improving and optimizing MSCs for future clinical application of bone regeneration.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f3c","doi":"10.1016\/j.jsbmb.2009.02.001","first_seen_on":"2015-01-13T08:55:51+00:00","issns":["09600760"],"journal":"Journal of Steroid Biochemistry & Molecular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1421139285,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0960076009000570"],"pmid":"19429449","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Steroid regulation of proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells: A gender difference ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/steroid-regulation-proliferation-osteogenic-differentiation-bone-marrow-stromal-cells-gender-differe-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7623978,"mean":6.5622012233206,"rank":3943304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2139030,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7623978,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236448,"mean":7.847477929515,"rank":117149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":92846,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236448,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":921,"mean":3.3110543478261,"rank":556,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":277,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":921,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":2.4103,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
