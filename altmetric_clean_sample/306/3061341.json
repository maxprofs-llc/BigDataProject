Many epidemiologic studies showed that an antioxidant supplementation decreases the state of oxidative stress. In the present work, a HFD-induced rat obesity and oxidative stress were used to investigate the link between fat deposition and serum-oxidative stress markers. We also studied the effect of a chronic administration of 3-keto-1,5-bisphosphonates 1 (a & b) (40\u00a0\u03bcg\/kg\/8\u00a0weeks\/i.p.). Exposure of rats to HFD during 16\u00a0weeks induced fat deposition, weight gain and metabolic disruption characterized by an increase in cholesterol, triglyceride and glycemia levels, and a decrease in ionizable calcium and free iron concentrations. HFD also induced serum-oxidative stress status vocalized by an increase in ROS (H2 O2 ), MDA and PC levels, with a decrease in antioxidant enzyme activity (CAT, GPx, SOD). Importantly, 3-keto-1,5-bisphosphonates corrected all the deleterious effects of HFD treatment in vivo, but it failed to inhibit lipases in vitro and in vivo. These studies suggest that 3-keto-1,5-bisphosphonates 1 could be considered as safe antioxidant agents that should also find other potential biological applications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024e1","authors":["Lahbib, Karima","Aouani, Iyadh","Cavalier, Jean\u2010Fran\u00e7ois","Touil, Soufiane"],"doi":"10.1111\/cbdd.12493","endpage":"301","first_seen_on":"2015-01-13T14:29:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1747-0285","1747-0277"],"issue":"3","journal":"Chemical Biology & Drug Design","last_mentioned_on":1421159318,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cbdd.12493\/abstract;jsessionid=BA2C450951CD26D21E4F28D2231B5338.f02t03"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cbdd.12493\/pdf","pmid":"25483977","pubdate":"2015-01-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"291","subjects":["pharmacology","biochemistry"],"title":"3\u2010Keto\u20101,5\u2010bisphosphonates Alleviate Serum\u2010Oxidative Stress in the High\u2010fat Diet Induced Obesity in Rats","type":"article","volume":"86","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/3keto15bisphosphonates-alleviate-serumoxidative-stress-highfat-diet-induced-obesity-rats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6345657,"mean":5.9804472839376,"rank":4459620,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1656572,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6345657,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":198090,"mean":8.2346471535523,"rank":123550,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":65435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":198090,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":685,"mean":1.6601637426901,"rank":248,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":398,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":685,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":0.58695652173913,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
