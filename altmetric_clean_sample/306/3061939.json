Such models are appropriate priors when exchangeability assumptions do not hold, and instead we want our model to vary fluidly with some set of covariates. Since the concept of dependent nonparametric processes was formalized by MacEachern, there have been a number of models proposed and used in the statistics and machine learning literatures. Many of these models exhibit underlying similarities, an understanding of which, we hope, will help in selecting an appropriate prior, developing new models, and leveraging inference techniques.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a67","authors":["Foti, N.J.","Williamson, S.A."],"doi":"10.1109\/tpami.2013.224","first_seen_on":"2015-01-13T19:30:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0162-8828","1939-3539"],"issue":"2","journal":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","last_mentioned_on":1421177405,"links":["http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6654119&reload=true"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/iel7\/34\/7004096\/06654119.pdf?arnumber=6654119","pmid":"26353247","pubdate":"2015-09-10T22:00:10+00:00","publisher":"IEEE","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Computer Software","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information Systems","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physical Sciences","Computer Science"],"subjects":["medicalinformatics"],"title":"A Survey of Non-Exchangeable Priors for Bayesian Nonparametric Models","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/survey-nonexchangeable-priors-bayesian-nonparametric-models"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4729227,"mean":5.5465942099605,"rank":3255460,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":879162,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4729227,"percentile":18},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":158691,"mean":8.5923138319996,"rank":108513,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":32562,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":158691,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":910,"mean":1.6997139713971,"rank":604,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":152,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":910,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":3.325,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
