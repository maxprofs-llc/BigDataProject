This study examined the roles of Notch1 in murine primary B cells. During B-cell activation by B-cell receptor ligation, Notch1 was up-regulated while Notch2 was not. In addition, Notch1 up-regulation itself did not contribute to the further activation of B cells, but the Notch ligand was important for Notch1-mediated further B-cell activation. Moreover, Notch1 deficiency significantly decreased B-cell activation and antibody secretion under the presence of Notch ligand. These data suggest that Notch1 is an important mediator for enhancing B-cell activation and antibody secretion by Notch ligand.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a99","authors":["Kang JA","Kim WS","Park SG"],"doi":"10.1111\/imm.12333","first_seen_on":"2015-01-13T12:38:10+00:00","issns":["0019-2805"],"issue":"","journal":"Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1421152594,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24913005?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24913005","pubdate":"2014-06-11T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Notch1 is an important mediator for enhancing of B cell activation and antibody secretion by Notch ligand.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/notch1-important-mediator-enhancing-bcell-activation-antibody-secretion-notch-ligand"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4729227,"mean":5.5465942099605,"rank":3850178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":127780,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4729227,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":158691,"mean":8.59222090869,"rank":126128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":737,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":158691,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":653,"mean":2.8378220858896,"rank":542,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":653,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":4.9152173913043,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
