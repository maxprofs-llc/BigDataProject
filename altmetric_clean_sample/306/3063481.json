The ZGO@C\/Cu electrode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 1162 mA h g(-1) between 0.01 and 3.0 V at a current density of 0.2 A g(-1). It also shows a remarkable cycling stability and an excellent high-rate capability. At a current density of 2.0 A g(-1), a stable capacity of 790 mA h g(-1) is obtained without any noticeable decay over 100 cycles. Even at a high current density of 10 A g(-1), a reversible capacity of 465 mA h g(-1) is still obtained. The synthesis approach developed here could be utilized for the fabrication of other high-performance heterogeneous electrode structures for lithium ion battery applications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008ee3","authors":["Weimin Chen","Liyou Lu","Scott Maloney","Ying Yang","Wenyong Wang"],"doi":"10.1039\/c4cp05705h","endpage":"5114","first_seen_on":"2015-01-14T05:40:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1463-9084","1463-9076"],"issue":"7","journal":"Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics (PCCP)","last_mentioned_on":1421213999,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2015\/CP\/C4CP05705H"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2015\/cp\/c4cp05705h","pmid":"25600214","pubdate":"2015-02-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"5109","subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"title":"Coaxial Zn2GeO4@Carbon Nanowires Directly Grown on Cu Foils as High-Performance Anodes for Lithium Ion Batteries","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/coaxial-zn2geo4-carbon-nanowires-directly-grown-cu-foils-highperformance-anodes-lithium-ion-batterie"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4734919,"mean":5.4827829794683,"rank":3262661,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":876640,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4734919,"percentile":18},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159071,"mean":8.540173772553,"rank":108788,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":32604,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159071,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2215,"mean":2.1029810298103,"rank":1228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":669,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2215,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":1.8944590163934,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
