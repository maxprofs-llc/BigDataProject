Applications to histone PTM in yeast."],"citation":{"abstract":"We present a modified approach of chromatin immuno-precipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq), which relies on the direct ligation of molecular barcodes to chromatin fragments, thereby permitting experimental scale-up. With Bar-ChIP now enabling the concurrent profiling of multiple DNA-protein interactions, we report the simultaneous generation of 90 ChIP-Seq datasets without any robotic instrumentation. We demonstrate that application of Bar-ChIP to a panel of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromatin-associated mutants provides a rapid and accurate genome-wide overview of their chromatin status. Additionally, we validate the utility of this technology to derive novel biological insights by identifying a role for the Rpd3S complex in maintaining H3K14 hypo-acetylation in gene bodies. We also report an association between the presence of intragenic H3K4 tri-methylation and the emergence of cryptic transcription in a Set2 mutant. Finally, we uncover a crosstalk between H3K14 acetylation and H3K4 methylation in this mutant. These results show that Bar-ChIP enables biological discovery through rapid chromatin profiling at single-nucleosome resolution for various conditions and protein modifications at once.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422d","authors":["Christophe D Chabbert","Sophie H Adjalley","Bernd Klaus","Emilie S Fritsch","Ishaan Gupta","Vicent Pelechano","Lars M Steinmetz","Chabbert, Christophe D","Adjalley, Sophie H","Klaus, Bernd","Fritsch, Emilie S","Gupta, Ishaan","Pelechano, Vicent","Steinmetz, Lars M"],"doi":"10.15252\/msb.20145776","endpage":"777","first_seen_on":"2015-01-13T12:13:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1744-4292",""],"issue":"1","journal":"Molecular Systems Biology","last_mentioned_on":1423307309,"links":["http:\/\/msb.embopress.org\/content\/11\/1\/777","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25583149?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.15252\/msb.20145776\/abstract;jsessionid=0C0285153E75DBB2A0C115AC7D6A749E.f04t01","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.15252\/msb.20145776\/abstract;jsessionid=CF5D0130F7FD01D02D6E35B256A4E6DB.f03t03"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/hw-f5-msb.highwire.org\/content\/msb\/11\/1\/777.full.pdf","pmid":"25583149","pubdate":"2015-01-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"EMBO Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Mathematics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Computer Science","Medicine","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"777","subjects":["molecularbiology","computationalbiology"],"title":"A high\u2010throughput ChIP\u2010Seq for large\u2010scale chromatin studies","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highthroughput-chipseq-largescale-chromatin-studies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7128756,"mean":6.3034262207045,"rank":851920,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":6275385,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7128756,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232697,"mean":7.7609731065425,"rank":34083,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":198521,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232697,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":625,"mean":10.688871794872,"rank":208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":416,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":625,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":33.3298,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":7},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":7,"Members of the public":7}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":33,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
