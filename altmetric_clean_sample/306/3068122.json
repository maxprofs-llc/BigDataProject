African races of the stem rust pathogen (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici) are a serious threat to barley production worldwide because of their wide virulence. To discover and characterize resistance to African stem rust race TTKSK in US barley breeding germplasm, over 3,000 lines\/cultivars were assessed for resistance at the seedling stage in the greenhouse and also the adult plant stage in the field in Kenya. Only 12 (0.3\u00a0%) and 64 (2.1\u00a0%) lines exhibited a resistance level comparable to the resistant control at the seedling and adult plant stage, respectively. To map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for resistance to race TTKSK, an association mapping approach was conducted, utilizing 3,072 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. At the seedling stage, two neighboring SNP markers (0.8\u00a0cM apart) on chromosome 7H (11_21491 and 12_30528) were found significantly associated with resistance. The most significant one found was 12_30528; thus, the resistance QTL was named Rpg-qtl-7H-12_30528. At the adult plant stage, two SNP markers on chromosome 5H (11_11355 and 12_31427) were found significantly associated with resistance. This resistance QTL was named Rpg-qtl-5H-11_11355 for the most significant marker identified. Adult plant resistance is of paramount importance for stem rust. The marker associated with Rpg-qtl-5H-11_11355 for adult plant resistance explained only a small portion of the phenotypic variation (0.02); however, this QTL reduced disease severity up to 55.0\u00a0% under low disease pressure and up to 21.1\u00a0% under heavy disease pressure. SNP marker 11_11355 will be valuable for marker-assisted selection of adult plant stem rust resistance in barley breeding.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f61000364b","authors":["Zhou H","Steffenson BJ","Muehlbauer G","Wanyera R","Njau P","Ndeda S"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00122-014-2297-8","first_seen_on":"2015-01-15T12:59:39+00:00","issns":["0040-5752"],"issue":"","journal":"Theoretical & Applied Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1421326583,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24710821?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24710821","pubdate":"2014-04-09T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Agriculture","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Biochemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Breeding\/Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Genetics & Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Association mapping of stem rust race TTKSK resistance in US barley breeding germplasm.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-mapping-stem-rust-race-ttksk-resistance-barley-breeding-germplasm"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4739474,"mean":5.4857892300663,"rank":3862348,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":122693,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4739474,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":166630,"mean":8.3687378547553,"rank":132325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":628,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":166630,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":457,"mean":1.9839780701754,"rank":334,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":457,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":1.1068965517241,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
