The role of MDR-ABC efflux transporters in prostate epithelial proliferation and differentiation remains unclear. We hypothesized that MDR-ABC transporters regulate prostate differentiation and epithelium regeneration. Prostate epithelial differentiation was studied using histology, sphere formation assay and prostate regeneration induced by cycles of repeated androgen withdrawal and replacement. Embryonic deletion of Abcg2 resulted in a decreased number of luminal cells in the prostate and increased sphere formation efficiency, indicating an imbalance in the prostate epithelial differentiation pattern. Decreased luminal cell number in the Abcg2 null prostate implies reduced differentiation. Enhanced sphere formation efficiency in Abcg2 null prostate cells implies activation of the stem\/progenitor cells. Prostate regeneration was associated with profound activation of the stem\/progenitor cells, indicating the role of Abcg2 in maintaining stem\/progenitor cell pool. Since, embryonic deletion of Abcg2 may result in compensation by other ABC transporters, pharmacological inhibition of MDR-ABC efflux was performed. Pharmacological inhibition of MDR-ABC efflux enhanced prostate epithelial differentiation in sphere culture and during prostate regeneration. In conclusion, Abcg2 deletion leads to activation of the stem\/progenitor cells and enhanced differentiating divisions; and pharmacological inhibition of MDR-ABC efflux leads to epithelial differentiation. Our study demonstrates for the first time that MDR-ABC efflux transporter inhibition results in enhanced prostate epithelial cell differentiation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100035be","authors":["Miss Mugdha D Samant","SamantMugdha D.","Samant MD","Jackson CM","Felix CL","Jones AJ","Goodrich DW","Foster BA","Huss WJ"],"doi":"10.1089\/scd.2014.0293","endpage":"1251","first_seen_on":"2015-01-15T07:15:36+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1547-3287","1557-8534"],"issue":"10","journal":"Stem Cells & Development","last_mentioned_on":1421307838,"links":["http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1089\/scd.2014.0293"],"pmid":"25567291","pubdate":"2015-01-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1236","subjects":["cellbiology","hematology"],"title":"Multi-Drug Resistance ABC Transporter Inhibition Enhances Murine Ventral Prostate Stem\/Progenitor Cell Differentiation.","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multidrug-resistance-abc-transporter-inhibition-enhances-murine-ventral-prostate-stemprogenitor-cell-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7209022,"mean":6.348921438844,"rank":5170401,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1783378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7209022,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243053,"mean":7.6855421391308,"rank":146972,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":82660,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243053,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":768,"mean":5.9752698826597,"rank":462,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":768,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":5.9046341463415,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ProstateCell\/status\/555624265102675968","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3066948],"posted_on":"2015-01-15T07:15:22+00:00","author":{"name":"Prostate Cell News","url":"http:\/\/www.prostatecellnews.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/748303124712955905\/NtSW3SIU_normal.jpg","description":"The online resource for the prostate cell community.
