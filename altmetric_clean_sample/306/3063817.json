It displays very potent antimicrobial activity both in vitro and in a mouse model of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) septicemia. The combination of TPPC with all classes of beta-lactams tested (including penam, carbapenem, cephem and oxacephem) showed highly synergistic (SYN) effects against MRSA strains, but not against methicillin-sensitive S. aureus strains. These SYN effects were observed with both a checkerboard methodology and a time-kill analysis. The TPPC analog, bis-methyl ester-TPPC, which has neither antimicrobial activity nor the ability to bind prenyl pyrophosphate, also potentiated the activity of beta-lactams. This result indicates that the mechanism of the SYN activity of TPPC is independent of its binding to prenyl pyrophosphate. Therefore, synergistically enhancing the anti-MRSA activities of TPPC and beta-lactams by combining them is a novel and potentially powerful therapeutic strategy for MRSA infections.The Journal of Antibiotics advance online publication, 14 January 2015; doi:10.1038\/ja.2014.169.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b62","authors":["Hideki Hashizume","Yoshiaki Takahashi","Shigeko Harada","Akio Nomoto"],"doi":"10.1038\/ja.2014.169","first_seen_on":"2015-01-14T08:04:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0021-8820","1881-1469"],"journal":"Journal of Antibiotics","last_mentioned_on":1441885329,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/ja.2014.169","http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/ja\/rss\/aop\/~3\/x8nCJnsMPlY\/ja.2014.169","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25586024?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25586024","pubdate":"2015-01-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Antimicrobial resistance","scheme":"npg"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"title":"Natural lipopeptide antibiotic tripropeptin C revitalizes and synergistically potentiates the activity of beta-lactams against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/natural-lipopeptide-antibiotic-tripropeptin-c-revitalizes-synergistically-potentiates-activity-betal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6326302,"mean":5.8274056156985,"rank":607108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":5711938,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6326302,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193751,"mean":8.4223463225808,"rank":26664,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":166645,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193751,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":765,"mean":4.4247670157068,"rank":61,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":679,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":765,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":9.2734375,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
