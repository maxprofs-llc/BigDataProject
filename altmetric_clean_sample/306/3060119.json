Contaminated injectable methylprednisolone led to the diagnosis of fungal infections in 751 patients and 64 deaths. In the United States, pharmacy compounding has traditionally been regulated by state boards of pharmacy rather than the FDA. To minimize safety risks related to pharmacy compounding, the Drug Quality and Security Act (DQSA) was signed into law November 27, 2013, to improve regulation of compounding pharmacies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007d2c","authors":["Qureshi N","Wesolowicz L","Stievater T","Lin AT"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-13T05:33:10+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"12","journal":"Journal of Managed Care Pharmacy","last_mentioned_on":1421126768,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25443512"],"pmid":"25443512","pubdate":"2014-12-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacy"],"title":"Sterile compounding: clinical, legal, and regulatory implications for patient safety.","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sterile-compounding-clinical-legal-regulatory-implications-patient-safety"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4729227,"mean":5.5465942099605,"rank":3849512,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":128899,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4729227,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":158687,"mean":8.641308180936,"rank":125924,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1054,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":158687,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118,"mean":3.0304786324786,"rank":77,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
