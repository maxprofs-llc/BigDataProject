Whereas the activation of autophagy in cells infected with other flaviviruses is well known, the interaction of WNV with the autophagic pathway still remains unclear and there are reports describing opposite findings obtained even analyzing the same viral strain. To clarify this controversy, we first analyzed the induction of autophagic features in cells infected with a panel of WNV strains. WNV was determined to induce autophagy in a strain dependent manner. We observed that all WNV strains or isolates analyzed, except for the WNV NY99 used, upregulated the autophagic pathway in infected cells. Interestingly, a variant derived from this WNV NY99 isolated from a persistently infected mouse increased LC3 modification and aggregation. Genome sequencing of this variant revealed only two non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions when compared to parental NY99 strain. These nucleotide substitutions introduced one amino acid replacement in NS4A and other in NS4B. Using genetically engineered viruses we showed that introduction of only one of these replacements was sufficient to upregulate the autophagic pathway. Thus, in this work we have shown that naturally occurring point mutations in the viral non-structural proteins NS4A and NS4B confer WNV with the ability to induce the hallmarks of autophagy such as LC3 modification and aggregation. Even more, the differences on the induction of an autophagic response observed among WNV variants in infected cells did not correlate with alterations on the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), suggesting an uncoupling of UPR and autophagy during flavivirus infection. The findings here reported could help to improve the knowledge of the cellular processes involved on flavivirus-host cell interactions and contribute to the design of effective strategies to combat these pathogens.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc10","authors":["Bl\u00e1zquez, Ana-Bel\u00e9n","Mart\u00edn-Acebes, Miguel A.","Saiz, Juan-Carlos"],"doi":"10.3389\/fmicb.2014.00797","first_seen_on":"2015-01-15T17:32:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1664-302X"],"journal":"Frontiers in Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1454270880,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fmicb.2014.00797\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25642225?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25642225"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fmicb.2014.00797\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4295549","pmid":"25642225","pubdate":"2014-12-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Amino acid substitutions in the non-structural proteins 4A or 4B modulate the induction of autophagy in West Nile virus infected cells independently of the activation of the unfolded protein response.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/amino-acid-substitutions-nonstructural-proteins-4a-4b-modulate-induction-autophagy-west-nile-virus-i-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.08,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7066845,"mean":6.2846355963116,"rank":846914,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":6216612,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7066845,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242093,"mean":7.6616808072966,"rank":35395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":206645,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242093,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4853,"mean":3.9142745259687,"rank":638,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":4207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4853,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":315,"mean":3.9274777070064,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":286,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":315,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
