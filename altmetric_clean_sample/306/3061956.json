H2O2 is critical at the early phase, whereas CXCL8 plays a key role in the late phases of recruitment, but the crosstalks between the two phases in vivo remain unknown. In this study using zebrafish, we report that H2O2 also contributes to neutrophil recruitment to injuries at the late phase as it induces Cxcl8 expression in vivo through a JNK\/c-JUN\/AP-1 signaling pathway. However, Erk and NF-\u03baB signaling were not involved in this crosstalk. Strikingly, H2O2 also promotes cxcl8 expression through modulation of histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation, histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation, and histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation levels at its promoter. These results explain how early H2O2 signal regulates neutrophil recruitment at all phases, directly via Lyn oxidation or indirectly by modulating cxcl8 gene expression, via the activation of redox-sensitive signaling pathways, and further point out H2O2\/DUOX1 as a key drug target for anti-inflammatory therapies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cc7","authors":["Sofia de Oliveira","Pierre Boudinot","\u00c2ngelo Calado","Victoriano Mulero"],"doi":"10.4049\/jimmunol.1402386","first_seen_on":"2015-01-13T19:39:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1550-6606"],"journal":"The Journal of Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1429801595,"links":["http:\/\/www.jimmunol.org\/content\/early\/2015\/01\/09\/jimmunol.1402386.abstract","http:\/\/www.jimmunol.org\/content\/early\/2015\/01\/09\/jimmunol.1402386.short","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25582859?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jimmunol.org\/content\/early\/2015\/01\/09\/jimmunol.1402386.full.pdf","pmid":"25582859","pubdate":"2015-01-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Duox1-Derived H2O2 Modulates Cxcl8 Expression and Neutrophil Recruitment via JNK\/c-JUN\/AP-1 Signaling and Chromatin Modifications.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/duox1derived-h-sub2sub-o-sub2sub-modulates-cxcl8-expression-neutrophil-recruitment-via-jnkcjunap1-si"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5028713,"mean":5.9653160399705,"rank":1186805,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3818743,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5028713,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179336,"mean":8.3508007918144,"rank":48564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":129920,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179336,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6085,"mean":2.3294483892176,"rank":565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":5468,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6085,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244,"mean":2.4601646090535,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":211,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
