Observational studies show association between elevated levels of remnant cholesterol and increased risk of cardiovascular disease, even when remnant cholesterol levels are defined, measured, or calculated in different ways. In-vitro and animal studies also support the contention that elevated levels of remnant cholesterol may cause atherosclerosis same way as elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, by cholesterol accumulation in the arterial wall. Genetic studies of variants associated with elevated remnant cholesterol levels show that an increment of 1mmol\/L (39mg\/dL) in levels of nonfasting remnant cholesterol associates with a 2.8-fold increased risk of IHD, independently of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Results from genetic studies also show that elevated levels of remnant cholesterol are causally associated with both low-grade inflammation and IHD. However, elevated levels of LDL cholesterol are associated with IHD, but not with low-grade inflammation. Such results indicate that elevated LDL cholesterol levels cause atherosclerosis without a major inflammatory component, whereas an inflammatory component of atherosclerosis is driven by elevated remnant cholesterol levels. Post-hoc subgroup analyses of randomized trials using fibrates in individuals with elevated triglyceride levels, elevated remnant cholesterol levels, show a benefit of lowering triglycerides or remnant cholesterol levels; however, large randomized trials with the primary target of lowering remnant cholesterol levels are still missing.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032e1","authors":["Varbo A","Benn M","Nordestgaard BG"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pharmthera.2013.11.008","first_seen_on":"2015-01-13T21:58:52+00:00","issns":["0163-7258"],"issue":"","journal":"Pharmacology & Therapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1449534572,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24287311"],"pmid":"24287311","pubdate":"2013-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Remnant cholesterol as a cause of ischemic heart disease: Evidence, definition, measurement, atherogenicity, high risk patients, and present and future treatment.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/remnant-cholesterol-cause-ischemic-heart-disease-evidence-definition-measurement-atherogenicity-high-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6697548,"mean":6.160080958295,"rank":2261889,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":4414209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6697548,"percentile":65},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229933,"mean":7.7022762729852,"rank":67038,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":161640,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229933,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":587,"mean":3.4193310580205,"rank":273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":310,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":587,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":8.37504,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
