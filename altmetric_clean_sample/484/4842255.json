Although open surgery is a widely used option for the treatment of acute Achilles tendon rupture, the optimal treatment is still disputed. In our study, 59 patients with unilateral, closed, acute rupture of the Achilles tendon were treated by open surgery using an allograft weave to augment the repair. All the surgeries were performed within 1 to 4\u00a0days after injury. The mean American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle-hindfoot score was recorded as 91.20 (range 88 to 95), 95.34 (range 92 to 98), and 98.27 (range 97 to 99) at the 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up visit, respectively. At the final follow-up visit, the mean difference between the mid-calf circumference of the injured and uninjured legs was 0.19 (range -0.03 to 1.50) cm (p\u00a0=\u00a0.43). At the final follow-up visit, the mean difference between the vertical distances from the plantar surface of the heel to the ground for the injured and uninjured lower extremities was 0.44 (range -0.03 to 0.5) cm (p\u00a0=\u00a0.17). Augmented repair using the allograft tendon weaving technique provided satisfactory tendon strength and functional outcomes and a timely return to the patients' activities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a39","authors":["Huang, Xiaowei","Huang, Gan","Ji, Ying","Ao, Rong Guang","Yu, Baoqing","Zhu, Ya Long"],"doi":"10.1053\/j.jfas.2014.12.029","first_seen_on":"2015-12-04T18:50:57+00:00","issns":["1542-2224","1067-2516"],"journal":"Journal of Foot & Ankle Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1449255012,"links":["http:\/\/www.jfas.org\/article\/S1067-2516%2814%2900674-7\/fulltext"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jfas.org\/article\/S1067251614006747\/pdf","pmid":"26015299","pubdate":"2015-01-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics","generalsurgery"],"title":"Augmented Repair of Acute Achilles Tendon Rupture Using an Allograft Tendon Weaving Technique","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/augmented-repair-acute-achilles-tendon-rupture-using-allograft-tendon-weaving-technique"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6647401,"mean":6.157074757346,"rank":2476002,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4071424,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6647401,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278737,"mean":8.573075928477,"rank":99094,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":174669,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278737,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":341,"mean":2.7426470588235,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":266,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":341,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":3.95,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
