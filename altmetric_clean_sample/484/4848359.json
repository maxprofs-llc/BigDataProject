However, there is currently no technique capable of directly providing chemical information about molecules undergoing heterogeneous charge transfer at the nanoscale. Tip-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (TERS) uniquely offers sub-nanometer spatial resolution and single-molecule sensitivity, making it the ideal tool for studying nanoscale electrochemical processes with high chemical specificity. In this work, we demonstrate the first electrochemical TERS (EC-TERS) study of the nanoscale redox behavior of Nile Blue (NB), and compare these results with conventional cyclic voltammetry (CV). We successfully monitor the disappearance of the 591 cm-1 band of NB upon reduction and its reversible reappearance upon oxidation during the CV. Interestingly, we observe a negative shift of more than 100 mV in the onset of the potential response of the TERS intensity of the 591 cm-1 band, compared to the onset of faradaic current in the CV. We hypothesize that perturbation of the electrical double-layer by the TERS tip locally alters the effective potential experienced by NB molecules in the tip-sample junction. However, we demonstrate that the tip has no effect on the local charge transfer kinetics. Additionally, we observe step-like behavior in some TERS voltammograms corresponding to reduction and oxidation of single or few NB molecules. We also show that the coverage of NB is non-uniform across the ITO surface. We conclude with a discussion of methods to overcome the perturbation of the double-layer and general considerations for using TERS to study nanoscale electrochemical processes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003145","authors":["Dmitry Kurouski"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.nanolett.5b04177","first_seen_on":"2015-12-07T15:27:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1530-6992"],"journal":"Nano Letters","last_mentioned_on":1449859567,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.nanolett.5b04177?journalCode=nalefd","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.nanolett.5b04177?ref=tw&hootPostID=6735c02caf175f02ad3854f8a2db5649"],"pmid":"26580153","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Probing Redox Reactions at the Nanoscale with Electrochemical Tip-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/probing-redox-reactions-nanoscale-electrochemical-tipenhanced-raman-spectroscopy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6738406,"mean":6.1618062182355,"rank":3037310,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3519744,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6738406,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281373,"mean":8.6518625804983,"rank":128926,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":140452,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281373,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3833,"mean":11.598491127349,"rank":2392,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1352,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3833,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":130,"mean":22.983751937984,"rank":87,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":130,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
