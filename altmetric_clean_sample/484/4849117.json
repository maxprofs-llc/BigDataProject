Special focus was placed on data in football athletes with information on return rate, timing of return, level of postoperative competition, and the ability to compete in the sport over time.\nTwenty studies describing 1,469 athletes including football players with articular cartilage injury were reviewed. Average return to sport was 79% without a significant difference in return rate or postoperative level of play between cartilage repair techniques. Time to return varied between 7 to 17 months, with the longest time for autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACI). Advanced sport-specific rehabilitation was able to reduce recovery time. Durability of results was best after ACI, with up to 96% continued sport participation after more than 3 years. Player age, time between injury and treatment, competitive level, defect size, and repair tissue morphology affected the ability to return to play. Sports participation after cartilage repair generally promoted joint restoration and functional recovery.\nArticular cartilage repair allows for a high rate of return to high-impact sports including football, often at the preinjury competitive level. The time of return and durability can be variable and depend on repair technique and athlete-specific factors. Advanced, sport-specific rehabilitation can facilitate return to football.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8303cf058f61000be40","authors":["Kai Mithoefer","Stefano Della Villa"],"doi":"10.1177\/1947603511410419","endpage":"62S","first_seen_on":"2015-12-07T19:29:40+00:00","issns":["1947-6035","1947-6043"],"issue":"1 Suppl","journal":"Cartilage","last_mentioned_on":1490107734,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4297171\/pdf\/10.1177_1947603511410419.pdf","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4297171\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4297171\/pdf\/10.1177_1947603511410419.pdf"],"pmid":"26069609","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"SAGE Publications","startpage":"57S","title":"Return to Sports after Articular Cartilage Repair in the Football (Soccer) Player","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/return-sports-after-articular-cartilage-repair-football-soccer-player"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8392157,"mean":7.0686031077041,"rank":4235071,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3941003,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8392157,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":303293,"mean":8.9942149941309,"rank":142461,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":148844,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":303293,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":141,"mean":3.1579285714286,"rank":84,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":55,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":141,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":2.5416666666667,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
