Cdk5 requires the p35 regulatory subunit for activation. Because Cdk5 is more abundantly expressed in neurons compared to p35, the p35 protein levels determine the kinase activity of Cdk5. p35 is a protein with a short half-life that is degraded by proteasomes. While ubiquitination of p35 has been previously reported, the degradation mechanism of p35 is not yet known. Here, we intended to identify the ubiquitination site(s) in p35. Because p35 is myristoylated at the N-terminal glycine, the possible ubiquitination sites are the lysine residues in p35. We mutated all 23 Lys residues to Arg (p35 23R), but p35 23R was still rapidly degraded by proteasomes at a similar rate to wild-type p35. The degradation of p35 23R in primary neurons and the Cdk5 activation ability of p35 23R suggested the occurrence of ubiquitin-independent degradation of p35 in physiological conditions. We found that p35 has the amino acid sequence similar to the ubiquitin-independent degron in the NKX3.1 homeodomain transcription factor. An Ala mutation at Pro247 in the degron-like sequence made p35 stable. These results suggest that p35 can be degraded by two degradation pathways: ubiquitin-dependent and ubiquitin-independent. The rapid degradation of p35 by two different methods would be a mechanism to suppress the production of p25, which over-activates Cdk5 to induce neuronal cell death.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Takasugi, Toshiyuki","Minegishi, Seiji","Asada, Akiko","Saito, Taro","Kawahara, Hiroyuki","Hisanaga, Shin-Ichi"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m115.692871","first_seen_on":"2015-12-04T12:04:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1083-351X"],"journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1449897449,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26631721?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26631721"],"pmid":"26631721","pubdate":"2015-12-04T22:00:51+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Two degradation pathways of the p35 Cdk5 activation subunit, dependent and independent of ubiquitination.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/two-degradation-pathways-p35-cdk5-cyclindependent-kinase-activation-subunit-dependent-independent-ub"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6739821,"mean":6.1636345691711,"rank":596566,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":6137668,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6739821,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279806,"mean":8.5974971569485,"rank":33663,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":245705,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279806,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29266,"mean":3.0959569451563,"rank":618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":28630,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29266,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":442,"mean":5.1582993197279,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":406,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":442,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
