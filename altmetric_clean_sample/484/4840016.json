A total of 30 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups and right cavernosal body was sutured with 5\/0 sutures (ETB: polyethylene terephthalate; PRL: polypropylene; VCR: polyglactine; and PDS: polydioxanone). An identical needle (3\/8-13\u2009mm cutting) was passed through the cavernosal bodies in the sham group (SHAM). After 3 weeks, all rats were killed and penile tissues were examined to assess the level (0-3) of inflammation, granuloma formation and fibrosis. There was a statistically significant difference among five groups regarding inflammation, granuloma formation and fibrosis levels (P<0.01 for all). The histological changes in the PRL group were not different from the SHAM group. Although the levels of granulation and fibrosis in the PDS group were also similar to the SHAM group, inflammation level was significantly higher. The inflammation, granulation and fibrosis levels were the highest in the ETB group. VCR caused similar levels of granulation and fibrosis to ETB. In conclusion, PRL suture is associated with the least histopathological change in the penile tissue. PDS can theoretically be a reasonable alternative to PRL as it causes similar levels of granulation and fibrosis.International Journal of Impotence Research advance online publication, 3 December 2015; doi:10.1038\/ijir.2015.32.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b60","authors":["M Tuken","S Altinay","M Z Temiz","O O Cakir","S Aykan","A Semercioz","E C Serefoglu"],"doi":"10.1038\/ijir.2015.32","first_seen_on":"2015-12-04T07:39:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0955-9930","1476-5489"],"journal":"International Journal of Impotence Research","last_mentioned_on":1454683201,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ijir\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/ijir201532a.html","http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/ijir\/rss\/aop\/~3\/KBE3j1oMP9Q\/ijir.2015.32"],"pmid":"26631923","pubdate":"2015-12-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Translational research","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"The effects of four different suture materials on penile tissue of rats","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-four-different-suture-materials-penile-tissue-rats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7103144,"mean":6.3016585108842,"rank":955557,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6085815,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7103144,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285252,"mean":8.720448657498,"rank":49429,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":232757,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285252,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":324,"mean":6.5577523219814,"rank":76,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":238,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":324,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":7.46875,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"The effects of four different suture materials on penile tissue of rats","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=25361426775&p=1pl&v=1&x=RvZiCpOx-HG5qiybjcDb_Q","license":"public","citation_ids":[4840016],"posted_on":"2016-02-05T14:40:01+00:00","summary":"Related Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical and Healthcare News Original Article: NEXT ARTICLE More From BioPortfolio on \"The effects of four different suture materials on penile tissue of rats\".","author":{"name":"Bioportfolio","url":"http:\/\/www.bioportfolio.com\/","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/000\/821\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2015-12-11_at_16.36.54.png?1449851849"}}]}}
