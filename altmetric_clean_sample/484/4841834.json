It forms an attachment organelle at a cell pole as a membrane protrusion composed of surface and internal structures, with a highly organized architecture. In the present study, we succeeded in isolating the internal structure of the organelle by sucrose-gradient centrifugation. The negative-staining electron microscopy clarified the details and dimensions of the internal structure, which is composed of terminal button, paired plates, and bowl complex from the end of cell front. Peptide mass fingerprinting of the structure suggested 25 novel components for the organelle, and 3 of them were suggested for their involvement in the structure through their subcellular localization determined by enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) tagging. Thirteen component proteins including the previously reported ones were mapped on the organelle systematically for the first time, in nanometer order by EYFP tagging and immunoelectron microscopy. Two, three, and six specific proteins localized specifically to the terminal button, the paired plates, and the bowl, respectively and interestingly, HMW2 molecules were aligned parallel to form the plate. The integration of these results gave the whole image of the organelle and allowed us to discuss possible gliding mechanisms.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000334c","authors":["Daisuke Nakane","Tsuyoshi Kenri","Lisa Matsuo","Makoto Miyata"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.ppat.1005299","first_seen_on":"2015-12-04T16:14:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1553-7374"],"issue":"12","journal":"PLoS Pathogens","last_mentioned_on":1449682791,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plospathogens\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.ppat.1005299"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plospathogens\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.ppat.1005299.PDF","pmcid":"PMC4669176","pmid":"26633540","pubdate":"2015-12-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e1005299","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Systematic Structural Analyses of Attachment Organelle in Mycoplasma pneumoniae","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/systematic-structural-analyses-attachment-organelle-mycoplasma-pneumoniae"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7087289,"mean":6.2929614402547,"rank":2527380,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4529170,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7087289,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285096,"mean":8.7171160911274,"rank":85822,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":197408,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285096,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4457,"mean":11.790991472172,"rank":2550,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":1886,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4457,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174,"mean":20.100832369942,"rank":129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
