Here we dissect the underlying mechanisms of neem-induced apoptotic cell death in cancer. We observed that neem-induced caspase activation does not require Bax\/Bak channel-mediated mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, permeability transition pore, and mitochondrial fragmentation. Neem enhanced mitochondrial DNA and mitochondrial biomass. While oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) Complex-I activity was decreased, the activities of other OXPHOS complexes including Complex-II and -IV were unaltered. Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were associated with an increase in mitochondrial biomass and apoptosis upon neem exposure. Complex-I deficiency due to the loss of Ndufa1-encoded MWFE protein inhibited neem-induced caspase activation and apoptosis, but cell death induction was enhanced. Complex II-deficiency due to the loss of succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit C (SDHC) robustly decreased caspase activation, apoptosis, and cell death. Additionally, the ablation of Complexes-I, -III, -IV, and -V together did not inhibit caspase activation. Together, we demonstrate that neem limonoids target OXPHOS system to induce cancer cell death, which does not require upregulation or activation of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002911","authors":["Yadav, Neelu","Kumar, Sandeep","Kumar, Rahul","Srivastava, Pragya","Sun, Leimin","Rapali, Peter","Marlowe, Timothy","Schneider, Andrea","Inigo, Joseph","O'Malley, Jordan","Londonkar, Ramesh","Gogada, Raghu","Chaudhary, Ajay","Yadava, Nagendra","Chandra, Dhyan"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.freeradbiomed.2015.11.028","first_seen_on":"2015-12-07T18:35:56+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1873-4596"],"journal":"Free Radical Biology & Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1449513290,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26627937"],"pmcid":"PMC4734361","pmid":"26627937","pubdate":"2015-12-07T22:36:39+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","biochemistry"],"title":"Mechanism of neem limonoids-induced cell death in cancer: Role of oxidative phosphorylation.","type":"article","volume":"90","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mechanism-neem-limonoidsinduced-cell-death-cancer-role-oxidative-phosphorylation-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6690562,"mean":6.1568806433399,"rank":3206763,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1987863,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6690562,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280760,"mean":8.6415810214453,"rank":142094,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":108682,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280760,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1457,"mean":4.1063612637363,"rank":747,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":531,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1457,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":4.0226923076923,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":49}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
