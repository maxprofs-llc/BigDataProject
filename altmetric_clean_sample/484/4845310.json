As point-of-care providers, critical care nurses play a key role in ensuring that patients receive the safest, most effective treatment available. In order to deliver scientific-based care, critical care nurses must stay abreast of the current trends, as well as engage in the evidence-based practice process. This study aimed to describe research activities, to identify barriers to implement evidence-based practice and to explore professional factors related to the use of evidence-based practice among critical care nurses at three teaching hospitals in south-eastern United States.\nA survey design and convenience sampling method was used. A sample of 30 critical care staff nurses participated in the study. A 61-item online questionnaire composed of a demographic survey - BARRIERS scale - and Evidence-Based Practice Questionnaire was used. Simple descriptive statistics, Pearson's product moment correlations, and independent-sample t test procedures were used to analyze the data.\nCritical care nurses' reported positive attitudes, but viewed knowledge and use of evidence-based practice less favorably. These results may indicate that having a positive attitude towards evidence-based practice does not necessarily translate to knowledge and use of the evidence-based practice process in clinical practice. An unwillingness to change and time constraints were identified as the top barriers to use evidence-based practice in this study. Perceptions of barriers to use evidence-based practice were higher in those critical care nurses who had less practical experience and educational preparation.\nThe results suggest that critical care nurses possess the foundation to engage in the evidence-based practice process; however, their knowledge, practice, and attitudes just need to be cultivated and strengthened. Understanding the nurses' professional factors, current use and barriers to implement evidence-based practice is an essential step to ensuring competency and value for engaging in the evidence-based practice process. The results of this study support the need for future research to address barriers that impact critical care nurses' ability to deliver state-of-the-science care.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e38","authors":["Phillips, Carswella"],"doi":"10.1097\/xeb.0000000000000044","first_seen_on":"2015-12-06T05:15:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1744-1609"],"issue":"4","journal":"International Journal of Evidence-Based Healthcare","last_mentioned_on":1449378932,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/ijebh\/Abstract\/2015\/12000\/Relationships_between_duration_of_practice,.3.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/ijebh\/2015\/12000\/Relationships_between_duration_of_practice,.3.pdf","pmid":"26630362","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"224","subjects":["healthservices"],"title":"Relationships between duration of practice, educational level, and perception of barriers to implement evidence-based practice among critical care nurses","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/relationships-between-duration-practice-educational-level-perception-barriers-implement-evidencebase"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6661874,"mean":6.1608212143919,"rank":3180524,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1986322,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6661874,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279846,"mean":8.6152916864691,"rank":141460,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":108465,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279846,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132,"mean":3.8547786259542,"rank":78,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":2.2083333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":3,"Nursing and Health Professions":6}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":1},"mendeley":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IJEBH\/statuses\/673370166470684672","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4845310],"posted_on":"2015-12-06T05:15:32+00:00","author":{"name":"IJEBH","url":"http:\/\/www.ijebh.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/568386819025149952\/Jwv3AoR6_normal.jpeg","description":"Publishes reliable evidence to assist health professionals in their decision-making and to inform health professionals, students and researchers.","id_on_source":"IJEBH","tweeter_id":"3044804499","geo":{"lt":-34.92866,"ln":138.59863,"country":"AU"},"followers":204},"tweet_id":"673370166470684672"}]}}
