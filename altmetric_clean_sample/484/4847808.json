The processes triggering this interaction may, however, be influenced by several environmental parameters, while their relative importance remains, unclear. Therefore, the present study assessed the implications of aging on the joint acute toxicity of copper (Cu) and nTiO2 for Daphnia magna over a study duration of up to 72\u2009h. Thereby, the influence of aging duration as well as ionic strength, pH and presence of different qualities of organic matter during aging was assessed. The results indicated that the presence of nTiO2 often reduced the Cu-induced toxicity for daphnids after aging - although with varying effect sizes, which was displayed by up to 3-fold higher EC50 values compared to the absence of nTiO2 . Moreover, the Cu speciation, influenced by the ionic composition and the pH as well as the presence of organic additives in the medium, strongly modulated the processes during aging with partly limited implications of the aging duration on the ecotoxicological response of D. magna. Nonetheless, the present study underpins the potential of nTiO2 to modify the toxicity induced by heavy metals in freshwater ecosystems under various environmental conditions. This pattern, however, needs further verification using heavy metal ions with differing properties in combination with further environmental factors, such as UV irradiation.
