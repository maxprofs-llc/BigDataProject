Not all patients are equally at risk. Age and health are risk factors that need to be taken into account, the aged eye being more at risk as is the eye with existing disease. The risk of photochemical damage to the retina is increased as a result of patients being examined with different ophthalmic instruments during a 24-h period. The ways in which the clinician needs to address these safety issues is discussed bearing in mind the guidelines that are being developed.Eye advance online publication, 4 December 2015; doi:10.1038\/eye.2015.247.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028a1","authors":["M Wolffe"],"doi":"10.1038\/eye.2015.247","first_seen_on":"2015-12-04T18:18:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0950-222X","1476-5454"],"journal":"Eye","last_mentioned_on":1457379637,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/eye\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/abs\/eye2015247a.html?utm_content=bufferd72d1&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/eye\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/eye2015247a.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/eye\/journal\/v30\/n2\/full\/eye2015247a.html"],"pmid":"26634713","pubdate":"2015-12-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical examination","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Risk factors","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"How safe is the light during ophthalmic diagnosis and surgery","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/safe-light-during-ophthalmic-diagnosis-surgery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7710646,"mean":6.6136274926344,"rank":3127694,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4534111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7710646,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":293053,"mean":8.8065760138129,"rank":101607,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":188385,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":293053,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1292,"mean":2.2798280402789,"rank":388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":891,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1292,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":3.5123076923077,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":3}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Eye_Journal\/statuses\/672842435647709184","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4842164],"posted_on":"2015-12-04T18:18:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Eye Journal","url":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/eye","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/603250225537523712\/LctPqQsC_normal.png","description":"Our core aim is to advance the science and practice of ophthalmology with the latest clinical and scientific based research and studies","id_on_source":"Eye_Journal","tweeter_id":"3299597086","geo":{"lt":51.50853,"ln":-0.12574,"country":"GB"},"followers":445},"tweet_id":"672842435647709184"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/EyedoctorReshma\/statuses\/672847337212010496","license":"gnip","rt":["Eye_Journal"],"citation_ids":[4842164],"posted_on":"2015-12-04T18:38:00+00:00","author":{"name":"Reshma Thampy","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/655499104332718080\/HBq7dFEv_normal.jpg","description":"Acute  Ophthalmology enthusiast, Undergrad Med Ed tutor.
