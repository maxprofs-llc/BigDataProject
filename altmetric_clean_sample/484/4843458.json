These are discussed in the context of the mechanistic challenges associated with the technical difficulty of proving that the net formal [4+2] cycloaddition under study, indeed proceeds through a synchronous, mechanism and that the putative biosynthetic enzyme deploys the pericyclic transition state required for a Diels-Alder cycloaddition reaction.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e9f","authors":["Kimberly Klas"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.joc.5b01951","first_seen_on":"2015-12-05T07:03:52+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1520-6904"],"journal":"Journal of Organic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1449299017,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.joc.5b01951"],"pmid":"26495876","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Natural Diels\u2013Alderases: Elusive and Irresistable","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/natural-dielsalderases-elusive-irresistable"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6650505,"mean":6.1597281108294,"rank":2967481,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3503135,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6650505,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279713,"mean":8.6020458900582,"rank":127853,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":139861,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279713,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3373,"mean":3.2244982206406,"rank":2211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1135,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3373,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":3.7467083333333,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
