HSCT mice model was established through infusion of 5\u2009\u00d7\u200910(6) bone marrow mononuclear cells after conditioned with BU\/CY. On day 7, 14, 21 and 28 after HSCT, mice were sacrificed for analysis of liver inflammation, cytokine secretion, NLRP3 expression and caspase-1 activation as well as release of ATP and high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1). Furthermore, NLRP3 selective inhibitor (BAY 11-7082) was administrated into mice after HSCT to evaluate its effects on liver inflammation. Severe liver inflammation and damage with elevated secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 were found in mice after HSCT. Meanwhile, elevated expressions of NLRP3 and caspase-1 activation in liver were found. In addition, increased release of ATP and HMGB1 were observed. Selective inhibition of NLRP3 decreased caspase-1 activation and secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18. Furthermore, NLRP3 inhibition also reduced infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils and improved liver function. In conclusion, NLRP3 was involved in BU\/CY-induced liver inflammation after HSCT and selectively inhibited it ameliorated liver inflammation and improved liver function, suggesting targeting NLRP3 might be a new approach in the prophylaxis of liver inflammation after HSCT.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Qiao, Jianlin","Huang, Yujin","Xia, Yuan","Chu, Peipei","Yao, Haina","Xu, Linyan","Qi, Kunming","Liu, Yun","Xu, Kailin","Zeng, Lingyu"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep17828","first_seen_on":"2015-12-05T19:05:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1449342314,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26635145?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4669461","pmid":"26635145","pubdate":"2015-12-05T22:02:18+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Bone marrow transplantation","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Experimental models of disease","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Busulfan and cyclosphamide induce liver inflammation through NLRP3 activation in mice after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/busulfan-cyclosphamide-induce-liver-inflammation-through-nlrp3-activation-mice-after-hematopoietic-s"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6650505,"mean":6.1597281108294,"rank":5674508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6650505,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279711,"mean":8.6020727181722,"rank":225619,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279711,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23620,"mean":14.255044582751,"rank":19995,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23620,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2321,"mean":14.607836206897,"rank":1912,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2321,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Immunol_papers\/statuses\/673216578876403712","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4844659],"posted_on":"2015-12-05T19:05:14+00:00","author":{"name":"ImmunologyPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507527250015576065\/AHPc4B-C_normal.png","description":"A TwitterBot for #Immunology papers on #PubMed searching for adaptive, innate and cyto\/chemokine.
