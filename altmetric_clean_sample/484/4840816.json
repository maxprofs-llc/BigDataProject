Chondrosarcomas are malignant bone tumors that are characterized by the production of chondroid tissue. Since radiation therapy and chemotherapy have limited effect on chondrosarcoma, treatment of most patients depends on surgical resection. We conducted this study to identify independent predictive factors and survival characteristics for conventional central chondrosarcoma and dedifferentiated central chondrosarcoma. Methods. A systematic literature review was performed in September 2014 using the Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Subsequent to a beforehand-composed selection procedure we included 13 studies, comprising a total of 1114 patients. Results. The prognosis of central chondrosarcoma is generally good for the histologically low-grade tumors. Prognosis for the high-grade chondrosarcoma and the dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma is poor with lower survival rates. Poor prognostic factors in conventional chondrosarcoma for overall survival are high-grade tumors and axial\/pelvic tumor location. In dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma the percentage of dedifferentiated component has significant influence on disease-free survival. Conclusion. Despite the fact that there are multiple prognostic factors identified, as shown in this study, there is a need for prospective and comparative studies. The resulting knowledge about prognostic factors and survival can give direction in the development of better therapies. This could eventually lead to an evidence-based foundation for treating chondrosarcoma patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100034be","authors":["Nota, Sjoerd P F T","Braun, Yvonne","Schwab, Joseph H","van Dijk, C Niek","Bramer, Jos A M"],"doi":"10.1155\/2015\/623746","first_seen_on":"2015-12-04T11:29:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1357-714X"],"journal":"Sarcoma","last_mentioned_on":1449228582,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26633939?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC4655064","pmid":"26633939","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"The Identification of Prognostic Factors and Survival Statistics of Conventional Central Chondrosarcoma.","type":"article","volume":"2015","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-prognostic-factors-survival-statistics-conventional-central-chondrosarcoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6647401,"mean":6.157074757346,"rank":3170918,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1982573,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6647401,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278737,"mean":8.5730909964983,"rank":140693,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":108193,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278737,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112,"mean":1.7644684684685,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.625,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Master":4,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":10,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1,"IT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/usmlestatistics\/statuses\/672739552033972224","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4840816],"posted_on":"2015-12-04T11:29:42+00:00","author":{"name":"Tom Heston","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/534004251312152577\/baMUGI2m_normal.png","id_on_source":"usmlestatistics","tweeter_id":"2901828409","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":9},"tweet_id":"672739552033972224"}]}}
