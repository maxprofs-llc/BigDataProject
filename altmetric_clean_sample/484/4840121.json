We investigated the effectiveness of RT over 60\u00a0Gy administered alone to NSCLC patients who were unfit or rejecting for combination treatment.\nFrom April 2002 to July 2010, 83 patients with stage II-III NSCLC, aged over 60\u00a0years, treated by RT alone with a curative aim were analyzed. Radiation was targeted to the primary tumor and clinically involved lymph nodes. A total dose of 66\u00a0Gy in 30 fractions (2.2\u00a0Gy\/fraction) was delivered once daily (5 fractions weekly). One month after completing RT, initial tumor responses were evaluated.\nMedian age of patients was 73\u00a0years (range, 60 - 82\u00a0years). The median survival time was 18.6\u00a0months (range, 2-135). The actuarial overall survival rates at 2 and 3\u00a0years were 39\u00a0% and 23\u00a0%, and cause-specific survival rate at 2 and 3\u00a0years were 57\u00a0% and 47\u00a0%, respectively. When primary tumor was controlled, the 2- and 3-year CSS were 56\u00a0% and 45\u00a0%, but 32\u00a0% and 23\u00a0% in those patients with local failure, respectively (P\u2009=\u20090.017). Additionally, the local control rate was associated with the initial tumor response (P\u2009=\u20090.01). No patient experienced grade 4+ toxicity.\nFor stage II-III NSCLC patients aged over 60\u00a0years and unfit or rejecting for combination treatment, RT alone showed promising result. Long-term disease control can be expected if an early tumor response to radiation is achieved, which could result in improved overall survival rates.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000088f","authors":["Ji Hyeon Joo","Ji Hyeon Joo","Si Yeol Song","Su Ssan Kim","Yuri Jeong","Seong-Yun Jeong","Wonsik Choi","Eun Kyung Choi"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13014-015-0560-z","first_seen_on":"2015-12-04T08:45:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1748-717X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Radiation Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1449302495,"links":["http:\/\/ro-journal.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s13014-015-0560-z"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ro-journal.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s13014-015-0560-z?site=http:\/\/ro-journal.biomedcentral.com","pmcid":"PMC4668693","pmid":"26635014","pubdate":"2015-12-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["neoplasms","radiotherapy"],"title":"Definitive radiotherapy alone over 60\u00a0Gy for patients unfit for combined treatment to stage II-III non-small cell lung cancer: retrospective analysis","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/definitive-radiotherapy-alone-60gy-patients-unfit-combined-treatment-stage-iiiii-nonsmall-cell-lung"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6650505,"mean":6.1597281108294,"rank":4920088,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":976008,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6650505,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278795,"mean":8.5763881288692,"rank":188081,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":53985,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278795,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1014,"mean":1.8728726554788,"rank":783,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":109,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1014,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":1.3103773584906,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"CY":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/medphyspapers\/statuses\/672697634235265024","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4840121],"posted_on":"2015-12-04T08:43:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Med Phys Papers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","description":"New publications in Medical Physics and Radiotherapy.","id_on_source":"medphyspapers","tweeter_id":"2879791906","geo":{"lt":54.75844,"ln":-2.69531,"country":"GB"},"followers":137},"tweet_id":"672697634235265024"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/fronimos1\/statuses\/673049565197680640","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4840121],"posted_on":"2015-12-05T08:01:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Andreas Sofroniou","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/764375886938464256\/CSbNmf25_normal.jpg","description":"http:\/\/Rad.Tech.","id_on_source":"fronimos1","tweeter_id":"434192863","geo":{"lt":34.675,"ln":33.03333,"country":"CY"},"followers":208},"tweet_id":"673049565197680640"}]}}
