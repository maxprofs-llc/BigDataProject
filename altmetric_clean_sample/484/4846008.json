This research studies the evolution of SWR in a Mediterranean calcareous soil affected by a forest fire, which occurred in Gorga (SE Spain) in July 2011, comparing the effect of the main vegetation cover between pine (Pinus halepensis) and shrubs species (Quercus coccifera, Rosmarinus officinalis, Cistus albidus, Erica arborea and Brachypodium retusum) and the relationship with soil moisture content (SMC). Also the study analyzed the effect of ash on SWR dynamics under field conditions. Six plots were established on the fire-affected area and the unburned-control-adjacent area to monitoring SWR with the water drop penetration time (WDPT) test, SMC through moist sensors (5cm depth) and three different ash treatments: ash presence, ash absence and incorporation of ash into the soil. An immediate increase of SWR was observed in the fire-affected area, mainly in pine plots. SWR changes in control (unburned) plots were quite similar between different types of vegetation influence, despite higher SWR values being observed on pine plots during the study period. A noticeable decrease of SWR was observed during the first months after fire in the affected areas, especially after the first rainy period, both in pine and shrubs plots. SWR increase was registered in all plots, and the highest levels were in March 2012 in burned pine plots. SWR decrease was higher in plots where ash was removed. Fire-affected soils became wettable 1year and a half after the fire.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100034e7","authors":["Jim\u00e9nez-Pinilla, P","Lozano, E","Mataix-Solera, J","Arcenegui, V","Jord\u00e1n, A","Zavala, L M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2015.09.121","first_seen_on":"2015-12-06T17:49:32+00:00","issns":["1879-1026","00489697"],"journal":"Science of the Total Environment","last_mentioned_on":1449424153,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0048969715307828"],"pmid":"26432513","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Temporal changes in soil water repellency after a forest fire in a Mediterranean calcareous soil: Influence of ash and different vegetation type ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/temporal-changes-soil-water-repellency-after-forest-fire-mediterranean-calcareous-soil-influence-ash"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6661874,"mean":6.1608212143919,"rank":3180533,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1986322,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6661874,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279847,"mean":8.6153495636885,"rank":141461,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":108465,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279847,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3125,"mean":4.7572624839949,"rank":1609,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1061,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3125,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171,"mean":3.4676,"rank":85,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":68,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
