The IR-induced p53 localizes in the nuclei and up-regulates p21\/Waf1 transcription but that does not lead to accumulation of p21\/Waf1 protein. The negative control of the p21Waf1 expression appears to occur at two levels of regulation. First, both p21\/Waf1 gene transcription and the p21\/Waf1 protein content increase in mESCs treated with histone-deacetylase inhibitors, implying its epigenetic regulation. Second, proteasome inhibitors cause the p21\/Waf1 accumulation, indicating that the protein is a subject of proteasome-dependent degradation in ES\u0421s. Then, the dynamics of IR-induced p21Waf1 protein show its accumulation at long-term time points (3 and 5\u00a0days) that coincides with an increase in the proportion of G1-phase cells, down-regulation of Oct4 and Nanog pluripotent gene transcription and activation of endoderm-specific genes sox17 and afp. In addition, nutlin-dependent stabilization of p53 in mESC was also accompanied by the accumulation of p21\/Waf1 as well as restoration of G1 checkpoint and an onset of differentiation. Thus, the lack of functional p21\/Waf1 is indispensable for maintaining self-renewal and pluripotency of mESCs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e17","authors":["Suvorova, Irina I","Grigorash, Bogdan B","Chuykin, Ilya A","Pospelova, Tatiana V","Pospelov, Valery A","Irina I.
