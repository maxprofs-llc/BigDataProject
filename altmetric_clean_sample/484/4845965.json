Associations of cholesterol changes with disease activity and drug treatment were evaluated using repeated measures analysis with mixed effect linear models to model the within-subject covariance over time.\nMixed effect models controlling for traditional CV risk factors, TEAR treatment, and baseline prednisone and statin use demonstrated significant inverse associations of RA disease activity with changes in cholesterol over time. Decreases in DAS28, CRP, or ESR were associated with increases in HDL-C, LDL-C, and TC in all treatment groups (p values <0.001-0.035). TT was strongly associated with higher HDL-C and lower LDL-C and TC\/HDL-C ratios (p values <0.001) compared to MTX monotherapy and MTX\u2009+\u2009ETA over two year follow-up.\nDecreases in RA disease activity over long term follow-up was associated with increases in cholesterol in early RA patients treated with either biologic or non-biologic therapies. The use of TT over two year follow-up was associated with higher HDL-C and lower LDL-C and TC\/HDL-C ratios compared to MTX monotherapy or MTX\u2009+\u2009ETA combination therapy.
