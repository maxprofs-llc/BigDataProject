However, the highly reactive and unstable radical intermediates make this task especially challenging. Herein, a strategy for taming radical redox reactions has been developed, in which solvent-bonding can alter the reactivity of the generated radical intermediates and thereby drastically alter the reaction selectivity at room temperature. Various \u03b2-oxy sulfoxides and \u03b2-hydroxy sulfides can be facilely obtained, some of which are difficult to synthesize by existing methods. Notably, neither a metal catalyst nor any further additives are necessary in these processes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Wang, Huamin","Lu, Qingquan","Qian, Chaohang","Liu, Chao","Liu, Wei","Chen, Kai","Lei, Aiwen"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201508729","endpage":"1097","first_seen_on":"2015-12-04T14:49:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3773"],"issue":"3","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
