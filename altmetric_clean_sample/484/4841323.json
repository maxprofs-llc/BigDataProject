Data were collected from self-report questionnaires, from an interview rated for Expressed Emotion (EE) and from direct observation of a family problem solving task which was rated for evidence of Minuchin's 'psychosomatic family' dimensions. A total of 87 families participated. Most self-report measures of family functioning did not distinguish between groups. There were no differences in levels of EE criticism. AN and CF households showed more EE emotional over-involvement than did the well households. Over-involvement correlated with illness severity. More households in the AN group were enmeshed, over-protective and poor at problem solving than in the CF and well groups. Minuchin's conceptualization of the anorexia nervosa family was partly supported.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033d9","authors":["Blair, C","Freeman, C","Cull, A"],"first_seen_on":"2015-12-04T13:54:52+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0033-2917"],"issue":"5","journal":"Psychological Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1474505642,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8588017"],"pmid":"8588017","pubdate":"1995-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"The families of anorexia nervosa and cystic fibrosis patients.","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/families-anorexia-nervosa-cystic-fibrosis-patients-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":25.592,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":25.592},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":353937,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":8064931,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":301805,"mean":8.9404839896089,"rank":17592,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":284213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":301805,"percentile":94},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2969,"mean":10.028241239892,"rank":217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":2751,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2969,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":11.42888,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":69,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":1}}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"We Need to Reject the False Narratives Around Anorexia.\u00a0I Can Start by Telling My Story.","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=23625317653&p=1pl&v=1&x=0AFSV1rDw4WFJB8NQAuYgA","license":"public","citation_ids":[4841318,4841320,4841323,2030831,2213306,4841324,1311351,3326406,4059235,1482402,4841325,535892],"posted_on":"2015-12-04T12:59:00+00:00","summary":"My parents have a small framed photograph of E and me in their upstairs hall.
