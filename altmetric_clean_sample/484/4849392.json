We evaluated the utility of using an IGRA in pediatric tuberculosis in younger children in a hospital setting. The diagnostic accuracy of T-SPOT.TB and TST was assessed in 117 children with active tuberculosis and 413 children with respiratory tract infection. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for the tests used individually and together. Concordance was also calculated. Sensitivity of T-SPOT.TB (82.9%) was higher than TST (78.6% using a 5mm cut-off), especially in children confirmed to have TB. T-SPOT.TB was more specific than TST using a 5mm cut-off (96.1% vs. 70.9%). Combining T-SPOT.TB and TST results improved the sensitivity to 96.6%. In conclusion, the results of the current study indicate that T-SPOT.TB has good sensitivity and specificity, supporting its use among patients of this age. A combination of IGRA and TST would be useful additions to assist in the diagnosis of childhood TB.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Lin Sun","Jian-ling Tian","Qing-qin Yin","Jing Xiao","Jie-qiong Li","Ya-jie Guo","Guo-shuang Feng","Xiao-xia Peng","Hui Qi","Fang Xu","Wei-wei Jiao","Chen Shen","A-dong Shen"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0143820","first_seen_on":"2015-12-07T21:40:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"12","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1449567044,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0143820"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0143820.PDF","pmcid":"PMC4671679","pmid":"26640948","pubdate":"2015-12-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0143820","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Performance of the Interferon Gamma Release Assays in Tuberculosis Disease in Children Five Years Old or Less","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/performance-interferon-gamma-release-assays-tuberculosis-disease-children-five-years-old-less"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6697548,"mean":6.160080958295,"rank":3210290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1990138,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6697548,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280912,"mean":8.642987971279,"rank":142174,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":108713,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280912,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100797,"mean":9.9311759792057,"rank":58098,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":31975,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100797,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4869,"mean":10.451585866886,"rank":2871,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1589,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4869,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
