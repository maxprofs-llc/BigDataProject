The continuous onset of multidrug-resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains limits the clinical efficacy of most of the marketed antibiotics. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new antibiotics. Pyrrolomycins are a class of biologically active compounds that exhibit a broad spectrum of biological activities, including antibacterial, antifungal, anthelmintic, antiproliferative, insecticidal, and acaricidal activities. In this review we focus on the antibacterial activity and antibiofilm activity of pyrrolomycins against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. Their efficacy, combined in some cases with a low toxicity, confers to these molecules a great potential for the development of new antimicrobial agents to face the antibiotic crisis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422e","authors":["Stella Cascioferro"],"doi":"10.3390\/molecules201219797","first_seen_on":"2015-12-04T18:16:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1420-3049"],"issue":"12","journal":"Molecules","last_mentioned_on":1450869574,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/20\/12\/19797?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/20\/12\/19797","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26690095?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/20\/12\/19797\/pdf","pmid":"26690095","pubdate":"2015-12-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Pharmaceutical Potential of Synthetic and Natural Pyrrolomycins","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pharmaceutical-potential-synthetic-natural-pyrrolomycins"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6818838,"mean":6.1901666501164,"rank":2886944,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":3776487,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6818838,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281410,"mean":8.6299589991789,"rank":116882,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":155234,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281410,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2881,"mean":2.2387715277778,"rank":600,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":2203,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2881,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195,"mean":1.4600515463918,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":162,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1,"Chemical Engineering":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CH":1,"GB":1},"mendeley":{"ID":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PharmSolidForms\/statuses\/672841813930065920","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4842160],"posted_on":"2015-12-04T18:16:03+00:00","author":{"name":"PharmSolidForms","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/671283844289536000\/DWFzL5zv_normal.jpg","description":"A twitterbot of #pharmaceutical #solidforms papers operated by @duanechl","id_on_source":"PharmSolidForms","tweeter_id":"4275260914","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":132},"tweet_id":"672841813930065920"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Molecules_MDPI\/statuses\/674130515612446720","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4842160],"posted_on":"2015-12-08T07:36:54+00:00","author":{"name":"Molecules MDPI","url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/journal\/molecules","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/482326110546321409\/Ne8yEAh3_normal.png","description":"Molecules (ISSN 1420-3049, IF 2.861), international, peer-reviewed, open access journal, covering all aspects of organic chemistry, with fast publication","id_on_source":"Molecules_MDPI","tweeter_id":"2495680742","geo":{"lt":47.41667,"ln":7.75,"country":"CH"},"followers":676},"tweet_id":"674130515612446720"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AntibioticResis\/statuses\/679622371947368448","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4842160],"posted_on":"2015-12-23T11:19:34+00:00","author":{"name":"AntibioticResistance","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/551766191962746880\/GlO2QteM_normal.jpeg","description":"Keep abreast of the latest developments in the fight against Antibiotic Resistance #AMR with the latest publications curated from PubMed.
