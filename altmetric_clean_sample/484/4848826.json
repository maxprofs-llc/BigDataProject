The reaction of Sc(0) with concentrated aqueous hydrochloric acid led to the isolation of [(H2O)5Sc(\u03bc-OH)]24Cl\u00b72H2O (1). Compound 1 was modified with a series of inorganic acids (i.e., HNO3, H3PO4, and H2SO4) at room temperature and found to form {[(H2O)4Sc(\u03ba(2)-NO3)(\u03bc-OH)]NO3}2 (2a), [(H2O)4Sc(\u03ba(2)-NO3)2]NO3\u00b7H2O (2b) (at reflux temperatures), {6[H][Sc(\u03bc-PO4)(PO4)]6}n (3), and [H][Sc(\u03bc3-SO4)2]\u00b72H2O (4a). Additional organosulfonic acid derivatives were investigated, including tosylic acid (H-OTs) to yield {[(H2O)4Sc(OTs)2]OTs}\u00b72H2O (4b) in H2O and [(DMSO)3Sc(OTs)3] (4c) in dimethyl sulfoxide and triflic acid (H-OTf) to form [Sc(H2O)8]OTf3 (4d). Other organic acid modifications of 1 were also investigated, and the final structures were determined to be {([(H2O)2Sc(\u03bc-OAc)2]Cl)6}n (5) from acetic acid (H-OAc) and [Sc(\u03bc-TFA)3Sc(\u03bc-TFA)3]n (6) from trifluoroacetic acid (H-TFA). In addition to single-crystal X-ray structures, the compounds were identified by solid-state and solution-state (45)Sc nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic studies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Timothy J.
