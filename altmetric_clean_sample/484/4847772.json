We extend continuous variable teleportation to include quantum teleamplification protocols that allow nonunity classical gains and a preamplification or postattenuation of the coherent state. We show that, for arbitrary Gaussian protocols and a significant class of Gaussian resources, two-way steering is required to achieve a teleportation fidelity beyond the no-cloning threshold. This provides an operational connection between Gaussian steerability and secure teleportation. We present practical recipes suggesting that heralded noiseless preamplification may enable high-fidelity heralded teleportation, using minimally entangled yet steerable resources.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008519","authors":["He, Qiongyi","Rosales-Z\u00e1rate, Laura","Adesso, Gerardo","Reid, Margaret D","Qiongyi He","Laura Rosales-Z\u00e1rate","Gerardo Adesso","Margaret D.
