Here, we describe pre-clinical studies with an Fc engineered IgA2m(1) antibody containing the variable regions of the EGFR antibody cetuximab. Compared to wild type IgA2m(1), the engineered molecule lacked two N-glycosylation sites (N166, N337), two free cysteines (C311, C472) and contained a stabilized heavy and light chain linkage (P221R mutation). This novel molecule displayed improved production rates and biochemical properties compared to wild type IgA. In vitro, Fab- and Fc-mediated effector functions such as inhibition of ligand binding, receptor modulation and engagement of myeloid effector cells for antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity were similar between wild type and engineered IgA2. The engineered antibody displayed lower levels of terminal galactosylation leading to reduced asialoglycoprotein-receptor binding and to improved pharmacokinetic properties. In a long-term in vivo model against EGFR-positive cancer cells, improved serum half-life translated into higher efficacy of the engineered molecule, which required myeloid cells expressing human Fc\u03b1RI for its full efficacy. However, Fab-mediated effector functions contributed to the in vivo efficacy since the novel IgA antibody demonstrated therapeutic activity also in non-FcalphaRI transgenic mice. Together, these results demonstrate that engineering of an IgA antibody can significantly improve its pharmacokinetics and its therapeutic efficacy to inhibit tumor growth in vivo.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dd4","authors":["Lohse, Stefan","Meyer, Saskia","Meulenbroek, Laura A P M","Jansen, J H Marco","Nederend, Maaike","Kretschmer, Anna","Klausz, Katja","M\u00f6ginger, Uwe","Derer, Stefanie","R\u00f6sner, Thies","Kellner, Christian","Schewe, Denis","Sondermann, Peter","Tiwari, Sanjay","Kolarich, Daniel","Peipp, Matthias","Leusen, Jeanette Hw","Valerius, Thomas"],"doi":"10.1158\/0008-5472.can-15-1232","first_seen_on":"2015-12-05T20:19:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1538-7445"],"issue":"2","journal":"Cancer Research","last_mentioned_on":1452816000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26634925?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/cancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/12\/03\/0008-5472.CAN-15-1232.long","http:\/\/cancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/12\/03\/0008-5472.CAN-15-1232.short?rss=1","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1158\/0008-5472.CAN-15-1232"],"pmid":"26634925","pubdate":"2015-12-05T22:02:31+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"An Anti-EGFR IgA That Displays Improved Pharmacokinetics and Myeloid Effector Cell Engagement In Vivo","type":"article","volume":"76","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antiegfr-iga-displays-improved-pharmacokinetics-myeloid-effector-cell-engagement-vivo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6975036,"mean":6.2337487846271,"rank":617157,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":6352308,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6975036,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284389,"mean":8.693294013812,"rank":34469,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":249459,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284389,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6629,"mean":6.6728829209415,"rank":584,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":6028,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6629,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":386,"mean":17.620742857143,"rank":87,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":386,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
