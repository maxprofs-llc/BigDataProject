Here, we report the possibility of using Lewis acidic ionic liquids (ILs) to obtain polyunsaturated ester dimerization-oligomerization and\/or, in the presence of another terminal alkene (propene), co-polymerization. In particular, we have tested the Lewis acidic mixtures arising from the addition of a proper amount of GaCl\u2083 (\u03a7 > 0.5) to two chloride-based (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, [bmim]Cl, and 1-butylisoquinolium chloride, [BuIsoq]Cl) or by dissolution of a smaller amount of Al(Tf\u2082N)\u2083 (\u03a7 = 0.1) in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, [bmim][Tf\u2082N]. On the basis of product distribution studies, [bmim][Tf\u2082N]\/Al(Tf\u2082N)\u2083 appears the most suitable medium in which methyl linoleate alkylation with propene can compete with methyl linoleate or propene oligomerization.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422e","authors":["Christian Pomelli"],"doi":"10.3390\/molecules201219805","first_seen_on":"2015-12-07T15:43:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1420-3049"],"issue":"12","journal":"Molecules","last_mentioned_on":1449558957,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/20\/12\/19805?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/20\/12\/19805\/pdf","pmid":"26690107","pubdate":"2015-12-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Alkylation of Methyl Linoleate with Propene in Ionic Liquids in the Presence of Metal Salts","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alkylation-methyl-linoleate-propene-ionic-liquids-presence-metal-salts"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6697548,"mean":6.160080958295,"rank":3004035,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3513178,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6697548,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280912,"mean":8.6429965149103,"rank":128638,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":140278,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280912,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2826,"mean":2.2553224778761,"rank":681,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":2038,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2826,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195,"mean":1.4154639175258,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":146,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
