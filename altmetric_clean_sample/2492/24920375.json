However, the expression of ZEB2 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and its association with prognosis remains unclear. In the present study, a tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry were used to investigate ZEB2 and epithelial (E-)cadherin expression in OSCC tissues (n=218) and peritumoral esophageal tissues (POT; n=60). There was a significantly increased incidence of positive ZEB2 expression in OSCC tissues compared with the expression in POTs (P<0.012). By contrast, the incidence of positive E-cadherin expression in OSCC tissues was significantly decreased compared with the expression in POTs (P<0.004). ZEB2 expression in OSCC was associated with a number of clinicopathological factors, and it was also an independent predictive factor for shorter overall survival time (P<0.001). Overall, ZEB2 may promote OSCC metastasis and is a potential prognostic marker for malignancy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f61000837d","authors":["Huo,Xiaodong","Huo,Bin","Wang,Huixing","Zhang,Hongdian","Ma,Zhao","Yang,Mingjian","Wang,Haitao","Yu,Zhentao","Xiaodong Huo","Bin Huo","Huixing Wang","Hongdian Zhang","Zhao Ma","Mingjian \u03a5ang","Haitao Wang","Zhentao Yu"],"doi":"10.3892\/ol.2017.6559","first_seen_on":"2017-09-07T20:30:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1792-1074","1792-1082"],"issue":"3","journal":"Oncology Letters","last_mentioned_on":1505988144,"links":["https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3892\/ol.2017.6559","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28927031?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.spandidos-publications.com\/ol\/14\/3\/2683\/download","pmcid":"PMC5588115","pmid":"28927031","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Spandidos Publications","title":"Prognostic significance of the epithelial\u2011mesenchymal transition factor zinc finger E\u2011box\u2011binding homeobox 2 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma","type":"article","volume":"14"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":7297867,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":158124,"mean":12.206185362028,"rank":128902,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":158124,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1383,"mean":1.2901461649783,"rank":728,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1383,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86,"mean":0.49623529411765,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/painmanwise\/statuses\/910806410459566080","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24920375],"posted_on":"2017-09-21T10:02:24+00:00","author":{"name":"painmanwise","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/514094062056390656\/ORtXawZi_normal.png","id_on_source":"painmanwise","tweeter_id":"2826634074","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":131},"tweet_id":"910806410459566080"}]}}
