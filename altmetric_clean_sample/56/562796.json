We assessed if the presence of BMMs had adverse prognostic significance in a 10-year follow-up study. Patients undergoing surgery for esophageal cancer were prospectively recruited between February 1999 and August 2000. Bone marrow aspirates were obtained from the iliac crest of patients under general anesthesia at the time of surgery. Immunocytochemical analysis using anticytokeratin antibodies CAM 5.2 and AE1\/AE3 was undertaken to determine the presence of BMMs. Union International Contre le Cancer staging was recorded for all patients. Patient follow-up was completed over a 10-year period through analysis of the Northern Ireland Cancer Registry. Forty-two patients (male = 35) were included, with a mean age of 67.2 years (range 39-83). BMMs were detected in 19 patients (45.2%). International Contre le Cancer tumor staging was stage I = 6, stage II = 10, stage III = 24, and stage IV = 2. BMMs were associated with lymphovascular invasion (P= 0.02) and advanced T stage (P= 0.02). Overall, 10-year survival was 21.4% (n= 9), with a median follow-up of 877.5 days (interquartile range 391.5-2546.3). There was no statistically significant difference between the survival of patients with or without BMMs (1451.4 vs. 1431.6 days, P= 0.99). Univariate analysis demonstrated a trend toward decreased survival for patients with positive lymph nodes (P= 0.07), an increased T stage (P= 0.06), and lymphovascular invasion (P= 0.07). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that none of the variables were significant predictors of mortality. Although the presence of BMMs correlates with recognized adverse tumor characteristics in patients with esophageal cancer, micrometastases detected in the bone marrow at time of surgery does not influence long-term survival.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000271e","doi":"10.1111\/j.1442-2050.2011.01307.x","first_seen_on":"2012-01-17T13:00:03+00:00","issns":["1442-2050"],"journal":"Diseases of the Esophagus","last_mentioned_on":1368181008,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22243663?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22243663","pubdate":"2012-01-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Bone marrow micrometastases in esophageal carcinoma: a 10-year follow-up study.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bone-marrow-micrometastases-esophageal-carcinoma-10year-followup-study-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631090,"mean":4.9276517821564,"rank":2898875,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":80287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631090,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232038,"mean":3.9680196951351,"rank":167161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":894,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232038,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164,"mean":1.0273006134969,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":0.62333333333333,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
