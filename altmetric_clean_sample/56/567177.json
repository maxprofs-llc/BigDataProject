The polyborate contains chiral layers constructed by two kinds of helical chains and also form new B(18)O(42) circles based on B(3)O(8) units [(3: \u0394+2T)]. One kind of Ba atom locates in the cavity surrounded by the B(11)O(11) ring within the anion layer, and the other kind of Ba atom inserts between two adjacent layers. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy demonstrates that the compound has a cutoff edge below 190 nm and has a large second-harmonic generation (SHG) effect, which is approximately 3 times that of KH(2)PO(4) (KDP) and is type-I phase matchable.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Li Wang","Shilie Pan","Lixian Chang","Jianyang Hu","Hongwei Yu"],"doi":"10.1021\/ic2021337","first_seen_on":"2012-01-20T04:16:55+00:00","issns":["0020-1669","1520-510X"],"journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1327032604,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ic2021337"],"pmid":"22264076","pubdate":"2012-01-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"120119163049005","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"\n              UV Nonlinear Optical Crystal Ba\n              \n              [B\n              \n              O\n              \n              (OH)\n              \n              ] Featuring Unique Chiral Layers with a New B\n              \n              O\n              \n              Circle Based on BO\n              \n              and BO\n              \n              Units\n            ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/uv-nonlinear-optical-crystal-ba2b6o9oh4-featuring-unique-chiral-layers-new-b18o42-circle-based-bo3-b"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506051,"mean":5.113311188876,"rank":3499413,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":136336,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506051,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235596,"mean":4.2386319573847,"rank":177494,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235596,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5999,"mean":1.6146855618539,"rank":5549,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5999,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":444,"mean":1.0817923250564,"rank":413,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":444,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
