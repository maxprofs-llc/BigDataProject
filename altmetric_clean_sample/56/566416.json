Evidence from endocrine, molecular and pathological measurements in clinical material taken before and after therapy with AIs and data from clinical trials in which AIs have been given as treatment either alone or in combination with other targeted agents suggest diverse causes for resistance. These include inherent tumour insensitivity to oestrogen, ineffective inhibition of aromatase, sources of oestrogenic hormones independent of aromatase, activation of signalling by non-endocrine pathways, enhanced cell survival and selection of hormone-insensitive cellular clones during treatment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007eb","authors":["William R Miller","Alexey A Larionov","Miller WR","Larionov AA"],"doi":"10.1186\/bcr2931","first_seen_on":"2012-01-19T17:33:58+00:00","issns":["1465-5411","1465-542X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Breast Cancer Research","last_mentioned_on":1326994213,"links":["http:\/\/breast-cancer-research.com\/content\/14\/1\/201\/abstract"],"pmid":"22277572","pubdate":"2012-01-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"201","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Understanding the mechanisms of aromatase inhibitor resistance","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/bcr2931","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/understanding-mechanisms-aromatase-inhibitor-resistance-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4681775,"mean":5.6992629016288,"rank":3320386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":759891,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4681775,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236151,"mean":4.4922659665468,"rank":147128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":43473,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236151,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":791,"mean":5.6448025316456,"rank":595,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":791,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":2.5047272727273,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
