Such differential migration at the population level can be strongly determined by individuals showing different consistencies in migratory traits. By tagging individual cyprinid fish with uniquely coded electronic tags, and recording their winter migrations from lakes to streams for 6 consecutive years, we obtained highly detailed long-term information on the differential migration patterns of individuals. We found that individual migrants showed consistent site fidelities for over-wintering streams over multiple migratory seasons and that they were also consistent in their seasonal timing of migration. Our data also suggest that consistency itself can be considered as an individual trait, with migrants that exhibit consistent site fidelity also showing consistency in migratory timing. The finding of a mixture of both consistent and inconsistent individuals within a population furthers our understanding of intrapopulation variability in migration strategies, and we hypothesize that environmental variation can maintain such different strategies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c6d","doi":"10.1098\/rsbl.2011.0634","first_seen_on":"2012-01-16T10:19:45+00:00","issns":["1744-957X"],"journal":"Biology Letters","last_mentioned_on":1326708349,"links":["http:\/\/rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org\/content\/8\/1\/21.long"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org\/content\/8\/1\/21.full.pdf","pmid":"21813551","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Variable individual consistency in timing and destination of winter migrating fish","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/variable-individual-consistency-timing-destination-winter-migrating-fish"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506977,"mean":5.1265981649798,"rank":3084155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":969037,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506977,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235765,"mean":4.2852878980679,"rank":147825,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":50464,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235765,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1493,"mean":22.952963806971,"rank":1359,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":91,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1493,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143,"mean":22.857704225352,"rank":124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":17,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
