The patient was referred for a bone scan to exclude osteomyelitis of the left stump. The bone scan showed increased uptake in the left below-knee amputation stump, raising the possibility of an infection. However, SPECT\/CT of this area confirmed the uptake to correspond to the heterotrophic ossification of the left below-knee stump and no evidence of osteomyelitis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f10","doi":"10.1097\/rlu.0b013e31823e9ac0","first_seen_on":"2012-01-20T01:31:49+00:00","issns":["0363-9762"],"issue":"2","journal":"Clinical Nuclear Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1335520509,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nuclearmed\/Abstract\/2012\/02000\/Heterotrophic_Ossification_in_a_Patient_Suspected.13.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/nuclearmed\/2012\/02000\/Heterotrophic_Ossification_in_a_Patient_Suspected.13.pdf","pmid":"22228343","pubdate":"2012-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"170","subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"Heterotrophic Ossification in a Patient Suspected of Having Osteomyelitis: Additional Value of SPECT\/CT","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/heterotrophic-ossification-patient-suspected-having-osteomyelitis-additional-value-spectct"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":2940759,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1424430,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235602,"mean":4.2805172813361,"rank":137655,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":88332,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235602,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1805,"mean":0.85408647450111,"rank":527,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":999,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1805,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94,"mean":0.93709677419355,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
