The fetal brain initiates neurogenesis and vasculogenesis during the second trimester, and depends on maternal-fetal circulation for nutrition and growth signals. We used high-resolution in vivo ultrasound imaging to test the hypothesis that EtOH interferes with fetal brain-directed blood flow during this critical developmental period.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021cc","authors":["Bake, Shameena","Tingling, Joseph D.","Miranda, Rajesh C."],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1530-0277.2011.01676.x","endpage":"758","first_seen_on":"2012-01-17T18:16:06+00:00","issns":["1530-0277","0145-6008"],"issue":"5","journal":"Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research","last_mentioned_on":1326823240,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1530-0277.2011.01676.x\/abstract#.TxW3AIalC48.twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1530-0277.2011.01676.x\/pdf","pmid":"22141380","pubdate":"2011-12-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"748","subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"Ethanol Exposure During Pregnancy Persistently Attenuates Cranially Directed Blood Flow in the Developing Fetus: Evidence from Ultrasound Imaging in a Murine Second Trimester Equivalent Model","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ethanol-exposure-during-pregnancy-persistently-attenuates-cranially-directed-blood-flow-developing-f"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":2325432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1541710,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235409,"mean":4.260008062598,"rank":102213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":97081,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235409,"percentile":41},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1200,"mean":10.561157631359,"rank":761,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1200,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90,"mean":8.5483146067416,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
