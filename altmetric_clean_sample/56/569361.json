Here we describe an assay that requires only one round of positive selection followed by high-throughput DNA sequencing and informatic analysis in order to select high-affinity aptamers. The assay is flexible, requires less hands on time, and can be used by laboratories with minimal expertise in aptamer biology to quickly select high-affinity aptamers to a target of interest. This assay has been utilized to successfully identify aptamers that bind to thrombin with dissociation constants in the nanomolar range.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006ca0","authors":["Hoon S","Zhou B","Janda KD","Brenner S","Scolnick J"],"doi":"10.2144\/000113786","first_seen_on":"2012-01-21T20:07:14+00:00","issns":["0736-6205"],"issue":"6","journal":"Biotechniques","last_mentioned_on":1326931200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22150332","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.2144\/000113786"],"pmid":"22150332","pubdate":"2011-12-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Aptamer selection by high-throughput sequencing and informatic analysis.","type":"article","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aptamer-selection-highthroughput-sequencing-informatic-analysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3636226,"mean":4.9206251576887,"rank":2018551,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":946071,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3636226,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231728,"mean":3.9570440820451,"rank":100444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":90437,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231728,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192,"mean":2.3168376963351,"rank":116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":44,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
