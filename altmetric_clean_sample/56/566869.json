However, the functions of many proteins in the protein sequence and structure databases are either uncertain (too divergent to assign function based on homology) or unknown (no homologs), thereby limiting the utility of the databases. The mechanistically diverse enolase superfamily is a paradigm for understanding the structural bases for evolution of enzymatic function. We describe strategies for assigning functions to members of the enolase superfamily that should be applicable to other superfamilies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Gerlt JA","Babbitt PC","Jacobson MP","Almo SC"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.r111.240945","first_seen_on":"2012-01-19T23:05:12+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":[],"journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1327013448,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22069326"],"pmid":"22069326","pubdate":"2011-08-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Divergent evolution in the enolase superfamily: strategies for assigning functions.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/divergent-evolution-enolase-superfamily-strategies-assigning-functions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506977,"mean":5.1265981649798,"rank":2312533,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1572415,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506977,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235589,"mean":4.2813057795816,"rank":102420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":97987,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235589,"percentile":41},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30237,"mean":2.4947569784363,"rank":18966,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":7027,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30237,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1198,"mean":1.5985463659148,"rank":359,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":501,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1198,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":30,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
