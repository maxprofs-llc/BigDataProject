In situ fixation with a single screw is the most accepted procedure to provide an optimal fixation, but fixation failure and slip progression suggest that the procedure might be improved. The aim of the present study was to biomechanically compare partially threaded screws (16 mm and 32 mm) and fully threaded screws in an in vitro porcine model.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dd4","doi":"10.1097\/bpo.0b013e31823b18dd","first_seen_on":"2012-01-15T14:50:32+00:00","issns":["0271-6798"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Pediatric Orthopaedics","last_mentioned_on":1338154350,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/pedorthopaedics\/Abstract\/2012\/01000\/Biomechanical_Study_of_16_mm_Threaded,_32_mm.14.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/pedorthopaedics\/2012\/01000\/Biomechanical_Study_of_16_mm_Threaded,_32_mm.14.pdf","pmid":"22173391","pubdate":"2011-12-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"70","subjects":["orthopedics","pediatrics"],"title":"Biomechanical Study of 16-mm Threaded, 32-mm Threaded, and Fully Threaded SCFE Screw Fixation","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biomechanical-study-16mm-threaded-32mm-threaded-fully-threaded-scfe-screw-fixation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4770290,"mean":5.7202418654314,"rank":2533210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1589370,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4770290,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235669,"mean":4.4759642123667,"rank":102710,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":100770,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235669,"percentile":42},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1338,"mean":1.8827643979058,"rank":518,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":663,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1338,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":0.71875,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Other":7,"Student  > Master":3,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":2,"Medicine and Dentistry":15,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"CA":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/JofPedOrtho\/status\/206860456328044544","citation_ids":[560489],"posted_on":"2012-05-27T21:32:30+00:00","author":{"name":"JofPedOrthopaedics","url":"http:\/\/pedorthopaedics.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1611346129\/JPO_Cover_-_Twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Official Journal of the Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America and European Paediatric Orthopaedic Society","id_on_source":"JofPedOrtho","tweeter_id":"400363293","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":91},"tweet_id":"206860456328044544"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/JPO_journ_lww\/status\/158542358168866816","citation_ids":[560489],"posted_on":"2012-01-15T13:33:38+00:00","author":{"name":"Wolters Kluwer","url":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/pedorthopaedics\/pages\/default.aspx","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1115864455\/image_normal.jpeg","description":"Focuses on traumatic injuries with hands-on on coverage of a fast-growing field.
