The protozoan parasite is transmitted by the sandfly bite during salivation that occurs at the moment of blood feeding. The components of vector saliva include anticlotting and vasodilatory factors that facilitate blood flow and immunomodulatory factors that inhibit wound healing and quell the immune response. Not surprisingly, these factors also play important roles in the establishment of Leishmania infection. To date, the majority of knowledge that has been generated regarding the process of Leishmania infection, including L. infantum chagasi transmission has been gathered by using intradermal or subcutaneous inoculation of purified parasites.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000883","authors":["Secundino, Nagila F C"],"doi":"10.1186\/1756-3305-5-20","first_seen_on":"2012-01-21T15:33:06+00:00","issns":["","1756-3305"],"issue":"1","journal":"Parasites & Vectors","last_mentioned_on":1327159491,"links":["http:\/\/www.parasitesandvectors.com\/content\/5\/1\/20\/abstract"],"pmid":"22260275","pubdate":"2012-01-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"The transmission of Leishmania infantum chagasi by the bite of the Lutzomyia longipalpis to two different vertebrates","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transmission-leishmania-infantum-chagasi-bite-lutzomyia-longipalpis-two-different-vertebrates"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5569395,"mean":6.3322411454478,"rank":4643285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5569395,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241120,"mean":4.6784456388756,"rank":195780,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241120,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1734,"mean":3.3897899596076,"rank":1454,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1734,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":2.3366865671642,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Student  > Ph.
