The first patient remained stable for many years with this combination treatment, whereas the second became psychotic several months after he had increased the dose of methylphenidate and had started to use cocaine. In the light of these two case studies, we have reviewed the literature on ADD psychosis, and we formulate recommendations regarding the specialised treatment needed for this uncommon disorder.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008b8a","authors":["Blom JD","Kooij JJ"],"first_seen_on":"2012-01-19T13:02:32+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"1","journal":"Tijdschrift voor Psychiatrie","last_mentioned_on":1326977700,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22237615?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22237615","pubdate":"2012-01-14T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"[ADD psychosis: treatment with antipsychotics and methylphenidate?].","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/add-psychosis-treatment-antipsychotics-methylphenidate"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506214,"mean":5.1186469373082,"rank":2974114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1398137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506214,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235584,"mean":4.2528881625587,"rank":139369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":87233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235584,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176,"mean":1.0369485714286,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":96,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.6875,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Other":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"DE":1},"mendeley":{"BR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/Medical4110\/status\/159830798856495104","citation_ids":[565473,566051],"posted_on":"2012-01-19T02:53:26+00:00","author":{"name":"Medical Specialists","url":"http:\/\/familyhealthdigest.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1571501083\/gynecologist_images_normal.jpg","description":"Remember your first visit to a specialist?
