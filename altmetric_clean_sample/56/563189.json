However, detailed analyses of individuals' responses are scarce. To learn more about the variability of ET adaptations, patterns of response were analyzed for each subject in a 1-year ET study. Eighteen participants [42 \u00b1 5 years, body mass index: 24 \u00b1 3 kg\/m(2), maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2max) ): 38 \u00b1 5 mL\/min\/kg] completed a 1-year jogging\/walking program on 3 days\/week, 45 min\/session at 60% heart rate (HR) reserve. VO(2max), resting HR (rHR), exercise HR (eHR) and individual anaerobic threshold (IAT) were determined by treadmill and cycling ergometry respectively. Intraindividual coefficients of variation were extracted from the literature to distinguish random changes from training responses. Eight participants showed improvements in all variables. In 10 participants, one or two variables did not improve (VO(2max), rHR, eHR and IAT remained unchanged in four, four, three and one cases, respectively). At least one variable improved in each subject. Data indicate that ET adaptations might be detected in each individual using multiple variables of different adaptation levels and intensity domains. Nonresponse seems to occur frequently and might affect all variables. Further studies should investigate whether nonresponders improve with altered training. Furthermore, associations between patterns of nonresponse and health benefits from ET are worth considering.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100034c5","authors":["Scharhag\u2010Rosenberger, F.","Walitzek, S.","Kindermann, W.","Meyer, T."],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1600-0838.2010.01139.x","endpage":"118","first_seen_on":"2012-01-17T16:40:01+00:00","issns":["1600-0838","0905-7188"],"issue":"1","journal":"Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports","last_mentioned_on":1486457707,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1600-0838.2010.01139.x\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1600-0838.2010.01139.x\/pdf","pmid":"20561283","pubdate":"2012-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"113","subjects":["sportsmedicine"],"title":"Differences in adaptations to 1 year of aerobic endurance training: individual patterns of nonresponse","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/differences-adaptations-1-year-aerobic-endurance-training-individual-patterns-nonresponse"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8172683,"mean":6.9158600214652,"rank":2066318,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4987431,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8172683,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251601,"mean":5.1666926232117,"rank":61609,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":180587,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251601,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1484,"mean":13.404501685772,"rank":777,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":648,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1484,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119,"mean":7.8220169491525,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":67,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
