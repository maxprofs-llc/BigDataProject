Warfarin exerts its anticoagulation effect by inhibiting the enzymes responsible for the cyclic interconversion of vitamin K in the liver. Vitamin K serves as a cofactor required for the carboxylation of the vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteins. By inhibiting the supply of vitamin K in the production of these proteins, warfarin indirectly slows their rate of synthesis. The authors describe a 46-year-old patient readily anticoagulated for a deep venous thrombosis who then required large doses of warfarin after initiation of total parenteral nutrition, which included lipid preparation that contained vitamin K, in addition to vitamin K required for the daily parenteral nutrition. The effect of total parenteral nutrition with vitamin K on anticoagulation is discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008e64","doi":"10.1097\/maj.0b013e3182382553","first_seen_on":"2012-01-18T19:36:39+00:00","issns":["0002-9629"],"issue":"","journal":"The American Journal of the Medical Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1331941192,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/amjmedsci\/9000\/00000\/Warfarin_Resistance_Associated_With_Parenteral.99406.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/amjmedsci\/9000\/00000\/Warfarin_Resistance_Associated_With_Parenteral.99406.pdf","pmid":"22143126","pubdate":"2012-01-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Warfarin Resistance Associated With Parenteral Nutrition","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/warfarin-resistance-associated-parenteral-nutrition"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":2934430,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1428616,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235872,"mean":4.2996907038172,"rank":136608,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":89336,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235872,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1056,"mean":1.4570028436019,"rank":509,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":473,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1056,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":1.0854838709677,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
