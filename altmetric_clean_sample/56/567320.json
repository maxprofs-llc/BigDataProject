The majority of low-grade gliomas reveal mutations in the genes encoding isocitrate-dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) or 2 (IDH2). These mutations are associated with metabolic changes that are potentially epileptogenic. We investigated the correlation between IDH1\/2 mutations and tumor localization and seizure as the initial symptom.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f6100088e0","authors":["Stockhammer F","Misch M","Helms HJ","Lengler U","Prall F","von Deimling A","Hartmann C","Florian Stockhammer","Martin Misch","Hans-Joachim Helms","Ulrike Lengler","Friedrich Prall","Andreas von Deimling","Christian Hartmann"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.seizure.2011.12.007","first_seen_on":"2012-01-20T09:28:10+00:00","issns":["10591311"],"issue":"","journal":"Seizure","last_mentioned_on":1327050038,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22217666"],"pmid":"22217666","pubdate":"2012-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BEA Trading Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"IDH1\/2 mutations in WHO grade II astrocytomas associated with localization and seizure as the initial symptom.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1059131111003190","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/idh12-mutations-grade-ii-astrocytomas-associated-localization-seizure-initial-symptom"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7419766,"mean":6.4517840672812,"rank":3814376,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2077510,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7419766,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248005,"mean":4.8927648505672,"rank":110634,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":100481,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248005,"percentile":40},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":781,"mean":2.7964948717949,"rank":429,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":286,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":781,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.7538461538462,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
