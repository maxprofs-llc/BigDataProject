This pattern has been shown to be depolarized in glucose-depleted cells after formaldehyde fixation and staining with rhodamine-tagged phalloidin. Loss of actin cables in mother cells was remarkable. Here we extend our knowledge on actin in live glucose-depleted cells co-expressing the marker of actin patches (Abp1-RFP) with the marker of actin cables (Abp140-GFP). Glucose depletion resulted in appearance of actin patches also in mother cells. However, even after 80 min of glucose deprivation these cells showed a clear network of actin cables labeled with Abp140-GFP in contrast to previously published data. In live cells with a mitochondrial dysfunction (rho(0) cells), glucose depletion resulted in almost immediate appearance of Abp140-GFP foci partially overlapping with Abp1-RFP patches in mother cells. Residual actin cables were clustered in patch-associated bundles. A similar overlapping \"patchy\" pattern of both actin markers was observed upon treatment of glucose-deprived rho(+) cells with FCCP (the inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation) and upon treatment with formaldehyde. While the formaldehyde-targeted process stays unknown, our results indicate that published data on yeast actin cytoskeleton obtained from glucose-depleted cells after fixation should be considered with caution.","altmetric_jid":"56b367fa2a83eea9718b48ca","authors":["Pavla Vasicova","Mark Rinnerthaler","Danusa Haskova","Lenka Novakova","Ivana Malcova","Michael Breitenbach","Jiri Hasek"],"doi":"10.15698\/mic2016.05.499","first_seen_on":"2017-03-31T15:53:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["23112638","2311-2638"],"issue":"5","journal":"Microbial Cell ","last_mentioned_on":1490975587,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28357356?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC5349148","pmid":"28357356","pubdate":"2016-04-12T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Formaldehyde fixation is detrimental to actin cables in glucose-depleted S. cerevisiae cells","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/formaldehyde-fixation-detrimental-actin-cables-glucosedepleted-s-cerevisiae-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8440126,"mean":7.0979478654558,"rank":7293018,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8440126,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249551,"mean":13.214424612302,"rank":206526,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249551,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97,"mean":1.5939166666667,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":0.98076923076923,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/yeast_papers\/statuses\/847839182768586752","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18354733],"posted_on":"2017-03-31T15:53:07+00:00","author":{"name":"yeast_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yeast","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/470859351591092225\/S4XxHSFa_normal.jpeg","description":"Get your fresh daily #yeast #papers from #Pubmed, #Arxiv, #BioRxiv and #PeerJ here!
