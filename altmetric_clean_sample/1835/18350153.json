Liamocins have antibacterial activity with specificity for Streptococcus sp. Previous studies reported that liamocin yields were highest from strains of A. pullulans belonging to phylogenetic clades 8, 9, and 11, cultured on medium containing sucrose. In this study, 27 strains from these clades were examined for the first time for production of liamocins from agricultural biomass substrates. Liamocin yields were highest from strains in phylogenetic clade 11, and yields were higher from cultures grown on sucrose than from those grown on pretreated wheat straw. However, when supplementary enzymes (cellulase, \u03b2-glucosidase, and xylanase) were added, liamocin production on pretreated wheat straw was equivalent to that on sucrose. Liamocins produced from wheat straw were free of the melanin contamination common in sucrose-grown cultures. Furthermore, MALDI-TOF MS analysis showed that liamocins produced from wheat straw were under-acetylated, resulting in higher proportions of the mannitol A1 and B1 species of liamocin, the latter of which has the highest biological activity against Streptococcus sp.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f610003740","authors":["Timothy D.
