As they are approved and their use becomes more widespread, oncology nurses should be aware of their development and unique considerations.\nThis article reviews properties of biosimilars; their regulation and approval process; the ways in which their quality, safety, and efficacy are evaluated; their postmarketing safety monitoring; and their significance to oncology nurses and oncology nursing.\u2029.\nA search of PubMed and regulatory agency websites was conducted for references related to the development and use of biosimilars in oncology. \u2029.\nBecause biologics are large, structurally complex molecules, biosimilars cannot be considered generic equivalents to licensed biologic products. Consequently, regulatory approval for biosimilars is different from approval for small-molecule generics. Oncology nurses are in a unique position to educate themselves, other clinicians, and patients and their families about biosimilars to ensure accurate understanding, as well as optimal and safe use, of biosimilars.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000255f","authors":["Vida Vizgirda","Ira Jacobs"],"doi":"10.1188\/17.cjon.e54-e60","first_seen_on":"2017-03-31T13:59:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1538-067X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Clinical Journal of Oncology Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1490981364,"links":["http:\/\/insights.ovid.com\/clinical-oncology-nursing\/cjon\/2017\/04\/000\/biosimilars-considerations-oncology-nurses\/35\/00063185"],"pmid":"28315542","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing","neoplasms"],"title":"Biosimilars: Considerations for Oncology Nurses\u2029.","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biosimilars-considerations-oncology-nurses"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8440126,"mean":7.0979478654558,"rank":4262626,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3959470,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8440126,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249550,"mean":13.214457930105,"rank":128819,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":110374,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249550,"percentile":44},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":402,"mean":4.6279102244389,"rank":213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":402,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":2.8738095238095,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
