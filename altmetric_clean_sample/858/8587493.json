In light of the changing landscape of the cervical screening programme, a study was conducted to investigate the current practice of British Society of Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology-accredited colposcopists on technique and rationale for performing a punch biopsy.\nA web-based questionnaire survey was e-mailed to all British Society of Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology-accredited colposcopists. Questions included selection criteria for performing a punch biopsy, number of biopsies, and technique. Results were analyzed by specialty, experience, and workload.\nA total of 749 colposcopists responded, 50.2% of the 1,493 total. The respondents were obstetrician and gynecologists (42.9%), gynecologists\/oncologists (33.6%), and nurse colposcopists (19.8%). Most colposcopists (78.3%) had more than 5-year colposcopy experience and saw in excess of 11 new cases (73.4%) of abnormal cervical cytology\/month. Most colposcopists (56%) aimed to take 2 biopsies to diagnose cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and very few (16.2%) reported routinely taking random biopsies from normal areas of cervix. Looking at the trends in management in the case scenarios, there was a lower threshold for performing punch biopsy before large loop excision of the transformation zone in younger (age, <25 years) or nulliparous women versus older women (age, >40 years; p < .05). Colposcopists were more likely to take biopsies in women with low-grade cytology\/colposcopic findings (71.2%, always or most of the times) as compared with high-grade cytology\/colposcopic findings (40.3%, never or rarely).\nColposcopically directed punch biopsy is routinely used by colposcopists; however, techniques, number of biopsies taken, and rationale for performing a biopsy vary greatly between colposcopists.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007d25","authors":["Myriokefalitaki, Eva","Redman, Charles W.E.","Potdar, Neelam","Pearmain, Philippa","Moss, Esther L."],"doi":"10.1097\/lgt.0000000000000222","first_seen_on":"2016-06-08T13:01:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1526-0976","1089-2591"],"journal":"Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease","last_mentioned_on":1465390896,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jlgtd\/Abstract\/publishahead\/The_Use_of_the_Colposcopically_Directed_Punch.99599.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jlgtd\/9000\/00000\/The_Use_of_the_Colposcopically_Directed_Punch.99599.pdf","pmid":"27243143","pubdate":"2016-05-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["gynecology"],"title":"The Use of the Colposcopically Directed Punch Biopsy in Clinical Practice","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jlgtd\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/The_Use_of_the_Colposcopically_Directed_Punch.99599.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/colposcopically-directed-punch-biopsy-clinical-practice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7871308,"mean":6.6666994406334,"rank":5969627,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1054944,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7871308,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268735,"mean":11.392362827182,"rank":187889,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":44772,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268735,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":307,"mean":3.2616993464052,"rank":201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":307,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":0.78947368421053,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
