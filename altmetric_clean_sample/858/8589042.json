Intermittent hot water immersion (\"heat therapy\") results in elevations in core temperature and changes in cardiovascular hemodynamics, such as cardiac output and vascular shear stress, that are similar to exercise, and thus, may provide an alternative means of improving health which could be utilized by patients with low exercise tolerance and\/or capabilities. We sought to comprehensively assess the effects of 8 weeks of heat therapy biomarkers of vascular function in young, sedentary subjects.\nTwenty young, sedentary subjects were assigned to participate in 8 weeks (4-5x\/week) of heat therapy (N\u00a0=\u00a010; immersion in a 40.5\u00b0C bath sufficient to maintain rectal temperature \u2265\u00a038.5\u00b0C for 60\u00a0min per session) or thermoneutral water immersion (N\u00a0=\u00a010; sham).\nEight weeks of heat therapy increased flow-mediated dilation from 5.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3% to 10.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0% (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and superficial femoral dynamic arterial compliance from 0.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01 to 0.09\u00a0\u00b10.01\u00a0mm(2) \u00a0mmHg(-1) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03), and reduced (i.e., improved) aortic pulse wave velocity from 7.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3 to 6.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0m\u00a0sec(-1) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03), carotid intima media thickness from 0.43\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01 to 0.37\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0mm (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and mean arterial blood pressure from 83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 to 78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0mmHg (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02). No changes were observed in the sham group or for carotid arterial compliance, superficial femoral intima media thickness or endothelium-independent dilation.\nHeat therapy improved endothelium-dependent dilation, arterial stiffness, intima media thickness, and blood pressure, indicating improved cardiovascular health. These data suggest heat therapy may provide a simple and effective tool for improving cardiovascular health in various populations. This article is protected by copyright.
