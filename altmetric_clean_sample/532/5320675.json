Based on extensive electronic literature searches, the evidence from clinical trials is summarised. Numerous herbal remedies, non-herbal remedies and other approaches have been tested and some seem to have antihypertensive effects. The effect size is usually modest, and independent replications are frequently missing. The most encouraging data pertain to garlic, autogenic training, biofeedback and yoga. More research is required before firm recommendations can be offered.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008cd0","authors":["Ernst, Edzard"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10354-005-0205-1","endpage":"391","first_seen_on":"2016-02-11T15:57:26+00:00","issns":["0043-5341","1563-258X"],"issue":"17-18","journal":"Wiener Medizinische Wochenschrift (WMW)","last_mentioned_on":1461334741,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16392435"],"pmid":"16392435","pubdate":"2005-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"386","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Complementary\/alternative medicine for hypertension: a mini-review.","type":"article","volume":"155","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/complementaryalternative-medicine-hypertension-minireview"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7588328,"mean":6.5418890751503,"rank":5742094,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1018553,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7588328,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":325796,"mean":9.662136877484,"rank":227717,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":49692,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":325796,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195,"mean":2.6878041237113,"rank":120,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":3.05,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
