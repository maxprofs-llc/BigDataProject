A total of 22 young male soccer players (age 17.2\u00b10.9 y) randomly completed six 4vs4 SSG situations. The control conditions occurred with goals scored without goalkeeper (4vs4-NO) and with goalkeeper (4vs4-GK). During the experimental conditions the situations incorporated 2 IW (4vs4+2IW-NO, 4vs4+2IW-GK) and 2 IEW (4vs4+2IW+2IEW-NO, 4vs4+2IW+2IEW-GK). Processed results did not included data from goalkeepers, IW and IEW players. The HR was divided in intensity-zones (Z1, Z2 and Z3, for <80%, 80-90% and >90% of maximal HR, respectively) and the analyzed technical-tactical actions were the pass, dribbling, collective success and pause. The effects of IW and IEW were analyzed thought repeated-measures ANOVA. During 4vs4+2IW+2IEW-NO greater time was recorded in Z1 (p<0.05) compared to 4vs4-NO and 4s4+2IW-NO. During 4vs4+2IW+2IEW-GK greater time was recorded in Z1 and less in Z3 (p<0.05) compared to 4vs4-GK. Greater RPE was reported in 4vs4-NO (p<0.01) and 4vs4+2IW-NO (p<0.01) compared to 4vs4+2IW+2IEW-NO, and during 4vs4-GK (p<0.01) than 4vs4+2IW+2IEW-GK. Greater number of dribbling situations were recorded during 4vs4-NO (p<0.05) compared to 4vs4+2IW+2IEW-NO. In conclusion, compared to the control condition of 4vs4, the incorporation of IEW reduced HR, RPE and dribbling actions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f6100040e2","authors":["Sanchez-Sanchez, Javier","Hern\u00e1ndez, Daniel","Casamichana, David","Mart\u00ednez-Salazar, Cristian","Ramirez-Campillo, Rodrigo","Sampaio, Jaime"],"doi":"10.1519\/jsc.0000000000001736","first_seen_on":"2016-12-11T15:09:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1533-4287","1064-8011"],"issue":"10","journal":"Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research","last_mentioned_on":1506069577,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Heart_Rate,_Technical_Performance_And_Session_Rpe.96223.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/Fulltext\/2017\/10000\/Heart_Rate,_Technical_Performance,_and_Session_RPE.5.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/9000\/00000\/Heart_Rate,_Technical_Performance_And_Session_Rpe.96223.pdf","pmid":"27930455","pubdate":"2016-11-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Heart Rate, Technical Performance And Session-Rpe In Elite Youth Soccer Small-Sided Games Played With Wildcard Player","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Heart_Rate,_Technical_Performance_And_Session_Rpe.96223.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/heart-rate-technical-performance-sessionrpe-elite-youth-soccer-smallsided-games-played-wildcard-play"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.75,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0.5,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451184,"mean":7.1040239874029,"rank":3895667,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4470710,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451184,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283274,"mean":12.008574901243,"rank":127395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":151883,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283274,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3922,"mean":16.275750573833,"rank":2956,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":926,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3922,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94,"mean":11.220215053763,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Sports and Recreations":10,"Arts and Humanities":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RufLudwig\/statuses\/807965520595222528","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[14657764],"posted_on":"2016-12-11T15:09:26+00:00","author":{"name":"Ludwig Ruf","url":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/ludwig-ruf-790655122?trk=nav_responsive_tab_profile","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/749888383388975105\/vNCbcHeh_normal.jpg","description":"MSc Student in S&C @CardiffMetCSS | BSc Sports Science | trying to get my feet into the field of S&C and Applied Sport Science","id_on_source":"RufLudwig","tweeter_id":"4882289747","geo":{"lt":51.48,"ln":-3.18,"country":"GB"},"followers":202},"tweet_id":"807965520595222528"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/vietals\/statuses\/911147963191300096","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[14657764],"posted_on":"2017-09-22T08:39:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Vietals","url":"http:\/\/www.vietals.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/810516338074599425\/U0epQoIy_normal.jpg","description":"Official Vietals\u00ae Twitter Account.
