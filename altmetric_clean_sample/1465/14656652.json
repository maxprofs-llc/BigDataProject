Targeting the transfer of exosomes from resistant cells to sensitive cells may be an approach to overcome some cases of drug resistance.\nIn this study, we investigated the potential role of exosomes in the process of psoralen reverse multidrug resistance of MCF-7\/ADR cells. Exosomes were isolated by differential centrifugation of culture media from MCF-7\/ADR cells (ADR\/exo) and MCF-7 parental cells (S\/exo). Exosomes were characterized by morphology, exosomal markers and size distribution. The ability of ADR\/exo to transfer multidrug resistance was assessed by MTT and real-time quantitative PCR. The different formation and secretion of exosomes were detected by immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy. Then we performed comparative transcriptomic analysis using RNA-Seq technology and real-time quantitative PCR to better understand the gene expression regulation in exosmes formation and release after psoralen treatment.\nOur data showed that exosomes derived from MCF-7\/ADR cells were able to promote active sequestration of drugs and could induce a drug resistance phenotype by transferring drug-resistance-related gene MDR-1 and P-glycoprotein protein. Psoralen could reduce the formation and secretion of exosomes to overcome drug resistance. There were 21 differentially expressed genes. Gene ontology (GO) pathway analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that the most significantly expressed genes were linked to PPAR and P53 signaling pathways which were related to exosomes formation, secretion and cargo sorting.\nPsoralen can affect the exosomes and induce the reduction of resistance transmission via exosomes might through PPAR and P53 signaling pathways, which might provide a novel strategy for breast cancer resistance to chemotherapy in the future.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000851","authors":["Xiaohong Wang","Xiaohong Wang","Chengfeng Xu","Yitong Hua","Leitao Sun","Kai Cheng","Zhongming Jia","Yong Han","Jianli Dong","Yuzhen Cui","Zhenlin Yang"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13046-016-0468-y","first_seen_on":"2016-12-11T12:45:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1756-9966"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Experimental & Clinical Cancer Research","last_mentioned_on":1481460444,"links":["https:\/\/jeccr.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s13046-016-0468-y"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jeccr.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s13046-016-0468-y?site=jeccr.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"27906043","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Apoptosis","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"186","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Exosomes play an important role in the process of psoralen reverse multidrug resistance of breast cancer","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exosomes-play-important-role-process-psoralen-reverse-multidrug-resistance-breast-cancer-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":1.1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7876706,"mean":6.669712343671,"rank":4100851,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3748651,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7876706,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251574,"mean":12.319767017923,"rank":137617,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":112380,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251574,"percentile":44},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":412,"mean":1.4992700729927,"rank":121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":289,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":412,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.9566666666667,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"DK":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MammaryCell\/statuses\/807929229572706305","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[14656652],"posted_on":"2016-12-11T12:45:13+00:00","author":{"name":"Mammary Cell News","url":"http:\/\/www.mammarycellnews.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/748296304674017280\/w_2TCc53_normal.jpg","description":"The online resource for the mammary cell community.
