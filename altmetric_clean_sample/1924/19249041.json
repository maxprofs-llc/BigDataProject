The objective of the present study is to characterize the underlying mechanism(s) of anti-cancer action of BRB in this preclinical animal model focusing on oxidative stress and its related oncogenic signaling pathways. Esophageal epithelial tissues were collected and assessed for markers of oxidative stress and nuclear factor \u03baB (NF\u03baB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). BRB reduced the incidence of esophageal cancer from 100% in NMBA-treated rats to 81.5% in rats treated with NMBA plus BRB (p < 0.05). Tumor multiplicity was reduced from 4.73 \u00b1 0.45 tumors per esophagus in NMBA-treated rats to 1.44 \u00b1 0.26 in rats treated with NMBA plus BRB (p < 0.001). The data indicated that NMBA treatment increased production of hydrogen peroxide and lipid hydroperoxide, reduced expression and activity of glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase 2, and activated NF\u03baB\/MAPK signaling in rat esophagus. The study's results show that BRB reverses oxidative stress and suppresses NF\u03baB\/MAPK pathways, which could be the mechanisms for esophageal cancer chemopreventive action of BRB in rats.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6573cf058f610009228","authors":["Ni Shi","Fang Chen","Xiaoli Zhang","Steven Clinton","Xiaofei Tang","Zheng Sun","Tong Chen"],"doi":"10.3390\/nu9040413","first_seen_on":"2017-04-22T02:23:18+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["2072-6643"],"issue":"4","journal":"Nutrients","last_mentioned_on":1493293268,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2072-6643\/9\/4\/413?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28441719?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28441719?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2072-6643\/9\/4\/413\/pdf","pmid":"28441719","pubdate":"2017-04-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Suppression of Oxidative Stress and NF\u03baB\/MAPK Signaling by Lyophilized Black Raspberries for Esophageal Cancer Prevention in Rats","type":"article","volume":"9"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8133607,"mean":6.8853774979927,"rank":4079978,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3846965,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8133607,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234146,"mean":12.773268931645,"rank":119072,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":105017,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234146,"percentile":44},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2503,"mean":14.352682653877,"rank":1645,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":764,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2503,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":298,"mean":6.1156363636364,"rank":151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":135,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":298,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/P_Doggy_Bone\/statuses\/855607862252285952","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19249041],"posted_on":"2017-04-22T02:23:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Precious Daniel\u2122","url":"http:\/\/facebook.com\/precious.ogunleye","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/891043583511470080\/FfBKDjay_normal.jpg","description":"All I want is to be RICH and FAMOUS through God's blessings.
