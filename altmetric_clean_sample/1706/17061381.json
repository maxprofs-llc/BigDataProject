Overall, 40 studies were included: four studies evaluated the impact of salt reduction interventions, while 36 studies were identified as relevant to the design, assessment, and implementation of salt reduction strategies. Detailed appraisal and commentary were undertaken on the four studies that measured the impact of the interventions. Among them, different evaluation approaches were adopted; however, all demonstrated positive health outcomes relating to dietary salt reduction. Three of the four studies measured sodium in breads and provided consistent evidence that sodium reduction in breads is feasible and different intervention options are available. None of the studies were conducted in low- or lower middle-income countries, which stresses the need for more resources and research support for the implementation of salt reduction interventions in these countries.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52a3cf058f610003f9f","authors":["Santos, Joseph Alvin","Trieu, Kathy","Raj, Thout Sudhir","Arcand, JoAnne","Johnson, Claire","Webster, Jacqui","McLean, Rachael"],"doi":"10.1111\/jch.12971","first_seen_on":"2017-03-06T21:01:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["15246175","1751-7176"],"journal":"Journal of Clinical Hypertension","last_mentioned_on":1488901639,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jch.12971\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jch.12971\/pdf","pmid":"28247592","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"The Science of Salt: A regularly updated systematic review of\u00a0the implementation of salt reduction interventions (March-August 2016)","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/jch.12971","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/science-salt-regularly-updated-systematic-review-ofthe-implementation-salt-reduction-interventions-m"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.65,"score_history":{"1y":3.65,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.65},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8320311,"mean":7.0122256031246,"rank":1951210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6368833,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8320311,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241941,"mean":13.680708489708,"rank":78827,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":163099,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241941,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":527,"mean":4.9271520912548,"rank":134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":393,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":527,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":3.03,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
