Both energy expressions depend on the third-order reduced density matrix (3-RDM) which is usually approximated from lower-order densities. The accuracy of these methods depends critically on the set of N-representability conditions enforced in the calculation and the quality of the approximate 3-RDM. There are no benchmark studies including most 3-RDM approximations and, thus far, no assessment of the deterioration of the approximations with correlation effects has been performed. In this paper we introduce a series of tests to assess the performance of 3-RDM approximations in a model system with varying electron correlation effects, the three-electron harmonium atom. The results of this work put forward several limitations of the currently most used 3-RDM approximations for systems with important electron correlation effects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008ee3","authors":["Mauricio Antonio Rodriguez Mayorga","Eloy Ramos Cordoba","Ferran Feixas","Eduard Matito"],"doi":"10.1039\/c6cp07616e","first_seen_on":"2017-01-13T23:27:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1463-9084"],"journal":"Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics (PCCP)","last_mentioned_on":1484350043,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2017\/CP\/C6CP07616E"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2017\/cp\/c6cp07616e","pmid":"28121319","pubdate":"2017-01-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"title":"Electron Correlation Effects In Third-Order Densities","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/electron-correlation-effects-thirdorder-densities"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8069307,"mean":6.8479199559378,"rank":6987539,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8069307,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":255049,"mean":12.814852600294,"rank":210577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":255049,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3953,"mean":2.1477596153846,"rank":2770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3953,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":411,"mean":1.5458195121951,"rank":178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":411,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
