Within arm changes were assessed with signed-rank tests. The 96-week percentage changes in fat and lean mass in the two PI arms were not different, thus outcomes for the PI arms were combined and compared to the RAL arm. Associations between baseline biomarkers and changes in body composition were assessed. All analyses used linear regression models.\n\u2003328 were randomized; 90% were male and 44% white non-Hispanic; at entry, median age was 36 years, HIV-1 RNA 4.6 log10 copies\/mL, and CD4 349 cells\/\u03bcL. Overall, at week 96, increases in limb fat (13.4%), subcutaneous (19.9%) and visceral abdominal fat (25.8%), trunk fat (18%), and lean mass (1.8%) were apparent (p<0.001 for changes within each arm). Changes for all fat and lean outcomes were not different between the PI arms, or between the RAL and the combined PI arms. Higher baseline HIV-1 RNA levels were associated with greater gains in peripheral and central fat.\n\u2003In treatment-na\u00efve participants initiating ART with TDF\/FTC, no differences in lean mass, and regional fat were found with RAL when compared to ATV\/r or DRV\/r over 96 weeks.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000255e","authors":["McComsey, Grace A.","Moser, Carlee","Currier, Judith","Ribaudo, Heather J.","Paczuski, Pawel","Dub\u00e9, Michael P.","Kelesidis, Theodoros","Rothenberg, Jennifer","Stein, James H.","Brown, Todd T."],"doi":"10.1093\/cid\/ciw017","first_seen_on":"2017-07-25T05:02:37+00:00","funders":["niaid","nhlbi"],"issns":["1058-4838","1537-6591"],"journal":"Clinical Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1500901750,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/cid\/ciw017"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/cid\/article-pdf\/62\/7\/853\/7453191\/ciw017.pdf","pmid":"26797215","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Body Composition Changes After Initiation of Raltegravir or Protease Inhibitors: ACTG A5260s","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/body-composition-changes-after-initiation-raltegravir-protease-inhibitors-actg-a5260s"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":7,"3m":7,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8266541,"mean":6.9778542507441,"rank":1202357,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6989639,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8266541,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":166741,"mean":11.502967626245,"rank":32734,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":133118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":166741,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8145,"mean":9.1149388506876,"rank":1797,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8145,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":6.3292962962963,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
