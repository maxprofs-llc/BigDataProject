The participants consisted of 2,158 adolescents aged 11-19 years from three middle schools, and they completed a number of measures assessing a wide range of automatic thoughts and syndromes related to internalizing and externalizing problems. Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated that thoughts about social threats, personal failure and hostility were the strongest predictors of anxiety, depression, and externalizing problems, respectively. Age was a statistically significant, albeit modest, moderator of the relationship between automatic thoughts about social threat and anxiety. The current study provides support for the cognitive content-specificity hypothesis in internalizing and externalizing problems in a Chinese sample.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100034c7","authors":["Yu, Meng","Xu, Wei","Xie, Qiuyuan","Zhu, Yawen","Chasson, Gregory s.","Wang, Jianping"],"doi":"10.1111\/sjop.12373","first_seen_on":"2017-07-25T09:31:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1467-9450","0036-5564"],"journal":"Scandinavian Journal of Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1500975080,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/sjop.12373\/abstract;jsessionid=7954E92C04B07A4ECAC0B3CA29FF8AF8.f01t03","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1111\/sjop.12373"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/sjop.12373\/pdf","pmid":"28741702","pubdate":"2017-07-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Automatic thoughts as a predictor of internalizing and externalizing problems in Chinese adolescents: A test of the cognitive content\u2010specificity hypothesis with age effects","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/automatic-thoughts-predictor-internalizing-externalizing-problems-chinese-adolescents-test-cognitive"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8272014,"mean":6.980828736602,"rank":7153817,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8272014,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169599,"mean":11.522734961497,"rank":138342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169599,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":368,"mean":5.6069046321526,"rank":318,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":368,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/889780092498522112","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22329144],"posted_on":"2017-07-25T09:31:20+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":980},"tweet_id":"889780092498522112"}]}}
