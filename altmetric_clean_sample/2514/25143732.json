The search aim was to identify guidelines pertaining to the post-root canal treatment follow-up recommendations published from 1946 with the final search date being 26 June 2016. The primary search was supplemented by searching internet search engines and several websites that might have guidelines. The guidelines obtained from the search end-result were assessed for quality and scientific evidence using the AGREE II instrument. Similarities and differences in the recommendations were identified.\nThirty guidelines were identified, seven of which met the inclusion criteria. Two guidelines used and clearly described the methods for obtaining scientific evidence from which the recommendations were set. The recommendations varied, particularly as regards the timing of the first review radiograph. Some guidelines lacked supporting evidence.\nThe recommendations for post-endodontic treatment radiographic follow-up varied among the identified guidelines. However, the methodology for obtaining the scientific evidence was poorly described in most of the guidelines. Guideline development groups should use the AGREE II instrument as a guide to produce higher quality guidelines. This article is protected by copyright.
