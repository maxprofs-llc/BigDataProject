Our aim was to explore the relationship between salt and blood pressure (BP) in a subsample of the World Health Organization Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) Wave 2 before implementation of legislation in South Africa.\nBlood pressure (BP) was measured in triplicate (n\u00a0=\u00a02722; median age 56 years; 33% male) and 24-h\u00a0urine collected in a nested subsample (n\u00a0=\u00a0526) for sodium, potassium and creatinine analysis. Hypertension prevalence was 55% in older adults (50-plus years) and 28% in younger adults (18-49 years). Median salt intake (6.8\u00a0g\/day) was higher in younger than older adults (8.6\u00a0g vs 6.1\u00a0g\/day; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and in urban compared to rural populations (7.0\u00a0g vs 6.0\u00a0g\/day; p\u00a0=\u00a00.033). Overall, 69% of participants had salt intakes above 5\u00a0g\/day. Potassium intakes were generally low (median 35\u00a0mmol\/day) with significantly lower intakes in rural areas and older adults. Overall, 91% of adults failed to meet the daily potassium recommendation of 90\u00a0mmol\/d. Salt intakes above 5\u00a0g\/day, and to a greater extent, a dietary sodium-to-potassium (Na:K) ratio above 2\u00a0mmol\/mmol, were associated with significantly steeper regression slopes of BP with age.\nThese preliminary results indicate that high dietary Na:K ratio may lead to a greater increase in BP and hypertension risk with age. Interventions to increase potassium intakes alongside sodium reduction initiatives may be warranted.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008344","authors":["L.J. Ware","K. Charlton","A.E.
