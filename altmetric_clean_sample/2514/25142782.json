Some authors have recently been suggesting a posterior approach associated to open reduction and osteosynthesis by a buttress plate. But in our knowledge there is no specific study on sports activity recovery after Moore I tibial fractures. The aim of this work was to assess sports activities and clinical outcomes after surgically treated Moore I tibial plateau fractures in an athletic population of skiers.\nWe conducted a prospective case series between 2012 and 2014. This included fifteen patients aged 39.6\u00b17 years whom presented with a Moore I tibial plateau fracture during a skiing accident. 12 cases (80%) presented with an associated tibial spine fracture. Treatment consisted of a standard antero-medial approach, with a medial para patellar arthrotomy to allow direct visualisation of articular reduction and spinal fixation. Two or three 6.5mm long cancellous bone screws were placed antero-posteriorly so as to ensure perfect compression of the fracture site. Radiological and functional results were assessed by an independent observer (Lysholm-Tegner, UCLA, KOOS scores) at the longest follow-up.\nMean follow-up was 18.2\u00b16 months (12-28). An immediate postoperative anatomical reduction was achieved in all cases and remained stable in time. At last follow-up Lysholm mean score was 85\u00b114 points (59-100), UCLA score was 7.3\u00b11.6 (4-10) and Tegner score was 4.6\u00b11.3 (3-6). Mean KOOS score was 77\u00b115 (54-97). 87% of patients had resumed their skiing activity and 93% were satisfied or very satisfied from their post-operative surgical outcome. We observed no pseudarthrosis or secondary varus displacement.\nIn our series 87% of patients had resumed back to their sporting activities. Surgical management of Moore I tibial plateau fractures by isolated antero-posterior screwing provides excellent clinical and radiological results. The anteromedial incision has a dual advantage of anatomical reduction, tibial spine fixation (in 80% of our cases) and posteromedial fragment reduction.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ade","authors":["Vincent Morin","R\u00e9gis Pailh\u00e9","Akash Sharma","Ren\u00e9-Christopher Rouchy","J\u00e9r\u00e9my Cognault","Brice Rubens-Duval","Dominique Saragaglia"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.injury.2016.03.024","first_seen_on":"2017-09-12T10:07:26+00:00","issns":["00201383"],"journal":"Injury","last_mentioned_on":1505210827,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27037028?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27037028","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Moore I postero-medial articular tibial fracture in alpine skiers: Surgical management and return to sports activity","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/moore-i-posteromedial-articular-tibial-fracture-alpine-skiers-surgical-management-return-sports-acti"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8404159,"mean":7.075409750737,"rank":4487476,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2339549,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8404159,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123216,"mean":11.641499898551,"rank":66289,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":44476,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123216,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1470,"mean":4.9352552756978,"rank":952,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":372,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1470,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":8.83375,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1,"Lecturer":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Design":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/FBDDworld\/statuses\/907546106413826048","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25142782],"posted_on":"2017-09-12T10:07:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Fragments","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/904156740316311552\/zBbC8AN7_normal.jpg","description":"News of interest to researchers in fragment based drug discovery","id_on_source":"FBDDworld","tweeter_id":"904097562352685057","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":5},"tweet_id":"907546106413826048"}]}}
