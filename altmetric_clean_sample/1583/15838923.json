Strontium chloride is known to increase osteoblastogenesis and repress adipogenesis, but its effects in microgravity-related conditions have not been established. Our goal was to investigate early events in this process, focusing on RhoGTPases as controllers of cytoskeletal organization leading to stem cell commitment. We cultivated C3H10T1\/2 on microspheres using a rotating wall vessel bioreactor (NASA) in order to simulate microgravity-related conditions in adipogenesis and osteoblastogenesis conditions independently. We observed that rotating wall vessel cultures presented increased adipogenesis, while osteoblastogenesis was reduced. Strontium-treated multipotent cells presented a significant repression in adipogenesis (-90\u2009%, p\u2009<\u20090.001 PPARyD8) and an activation of osteoblastogenesis (+95\u2009%, p\u2009<\u20090.001 bone sialoprotein and osteopontin D8), even in gravity altered conditions. We established that concomitant RhoA\/Rac1 activations were associated with osteoblastogenesis enhancement and adipogenesis limitation in uncommitted cells. As vascular endothelial growth factor splicing is mechanosensitive and its signaling is central to stem cell commitment, we investigated vascular endothelial growth factor production, isoforms and receptors expressions in our conditions. We observed that vascular endothelial growth factor and receptors expressions were not significantly affected, but we found that presence of soluble vascular endothelial growth factor was associated with RhoA\/Rac1 activations, whereas sequestration of vascular endothelial growth factor by cells was associated with RhoA\/Rac1 inhibitions. We propose that strontium triggers secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor and the subsequent Rac1 and RhoA activations leading to repression of adipogenesis and osteogenesis stimulation validating strontium as a counter measure for microgravity-induced alteration of cell commitment.","altmetric_jid":"55f17ebf2a83ee43768b4586","authors":["Fiona Louis","Wafa Bouleftour","Aline Rattner","Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Linossier","Laurence Vico","Alain Guignandon"],"doi":"10.1038\/s41526-016-0004-6","first_seen_on":"2017-01-26T20:46:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2373-8065"],"issue":"1","journal":"npj Microgravity","last_mentioned_on":1486056251,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41526-016-0004-6"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41526-016-0004-6.pdf","pmcid":"PMC5460183","pmid":"28649629","pubdate":"2017-01-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","startpage":"7","title":"RhoGTPase stimulation is associated with strontium \nchloride treatment to counter simulated microgravity-induced changes in multipotent cell commitment","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rhogtpase-stimulation-associated-strontium-chloride-treatment-counter-simulated-microgravityinduced"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8150076,"mean":6.9043957460448,"rank":3721702,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4347102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8150076,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263545,"mean":12.796741561181,"rank":122536,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":137161,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263545,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":34.420175438596,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":58.100363636364,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
