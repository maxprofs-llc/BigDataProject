The poor outcomes cause negative impact on the person's physical functioning and quality of life and put a financial burden on society. Rehabilitation is important to improve physical functioning after hip fracture. To maintain the continuity in rehabilitation we have an assumption that it is of utmost importance to continue and progress the functional training that already started at the hospital, while the patients are transferred to short-term stays in a nursing home before they are returning to home. The aim presently is to examine the effects of a functional training program, initiated by the physiotherapist and performed by the nurses, on physical functioning while the patients are at short term stays in primary health care.\nInclusion and randomization will take place during hospital stay. All patients 65\u00a0years or above who have sustained a hip fracture are eligible, except if they have a score on Mini Mental State (MMS-E) of less than 15, could walk less than 10 m prior to the fracture, or are terminally ill. The intervention consists of additional functional training as part of the habitual daily routine during short term stays at nursing homes after discharge from hospital. The primary outcome is physical functioning measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Secondary outcomes are Timed \"Up & Go\" (TUG), hand grip strength, activPAL accelerometer, and self-reported measures like new Mobility Score (NMS), Walking Habits, University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) activity scale, Fall efficacy scale (FES), EuroQol health status measure (EQ-5D-5\u00a0L), and pain.\nIssues related to internal and external validity in the study are discussed. The outline for the arguments in this protocol is organized according to the guidelines of the Medical Research Council (MRC) guidance on how to develop and evaluate complex interventions.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT02780076 .","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007ba","authors":["Kristi Elisabeth Heiberg","Vigdis Bruun-Olsen","Astrid Bergland"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12877-016-0398-8","first_seen_on":"2017-01-26T17:01:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1471-2318"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Geriatrics","last_mentioned_on":1486083601,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28095787"],"pmid":"28095787","pubdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Aging","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Geriatrics\/Gerontology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Rehabilitation","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"The effects of habitual functional training on physical functioning in patients after hip fracture: the protocol of the HIPFRAC study","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12877-016-0398-8","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-habitual-functional-training-physical-functioning-patients-after-hip-fracture-protocol-hipfr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8155605,"mean":6.9067370031636,"rank":7058883,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8155605,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263808,"mean":12.794138138866,"rank":218334,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263808,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":842,"mean":6.7814696789536,"rank":795,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":842,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":8.95275,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
