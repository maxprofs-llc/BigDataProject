Over a mean follow-up of 3 years, changes in all QOL measures favored the immediate group (p\u200a<\u200a0.001); estimated differences were: VAS\u200a=\u200a1.9, GH\u200a=\u200a3.6, PCS\u200a=\u200a0.8, MCS\u200a=\u200a0.9. When QOL changes were assessed across various demographic and clinical subgroups, treatment differences continued to favor the immediate group. QOL was poorer in those experiencing primary outcomes; however, when excluding those with primary events, results remained favorable for immediate ART recipients.\nIn an international randomized trial in ART-naive participants with >500 CD4+ cells\/\u03bcl, there were modest but significant improvements in self-assessed QOL among those initiating ART immediately compared to deferring treatment, supporting patient-perceived health benefits of initiating ART as soon as possible after an HIV diagnosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006920","authors":["Alan R.
