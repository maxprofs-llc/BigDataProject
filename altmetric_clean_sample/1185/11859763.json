In this work, we explore the N\u2550N bond cleaving ability of a high-spin iron(II) hydride dimer with concomitant release of H2. Specifically, this diiron(II) complex reacts with azobenzene (PhN\u2550NPh) to perform a four-electron reduction, where two electrons come from H2 reductive elimination and the other two come from iron oxidation. The rate law of the H2 releasing reaction indicates that diazene binding occurs prior to H2 elimination, and the negative entropy of activation and inverse kinetic isotope effect indicate that H-H bond formation is the rate-limiting step. Thus, substrate binding causes reductive elimination of H2 that formally reduces the metals, and the metals use the additional two electrons to cleave the N-N multiple bond.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Sarina M.
