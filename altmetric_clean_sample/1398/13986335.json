The technology used was the iOS's (iPhone Operating System) Objective-C programming language and its XCode programming environment; and SQLite in order to create the database. The biofeedback system is implemented by the use of two biosensors which are, in fact, a Microsoft band 2 in order to register the user's heart rate and a MYO sensor to detect the user's arm movement. Finally, the system was tested with seven elderly people from La Santa y Real Casa de la Misericordia nursing home in Bilbao. The statistical assessment has shown that the users are satisfied with the usability of the system, with a mean score of 79.29 on the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61d3cf058f6100078a4","authors":["Leire Lopez-Samaniego"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijerph13121176","first_seen_on":"2016-11-24T12:34:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1660-4601"],"issue":"12","journal":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1483022314,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-4601\/13\/12\/1176?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-4601\/13\/12\/1176"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-4601\/13\/12\/1176\/pdf","pmid":"27886146","pubdate":"2016-11-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1176","subjects":["publichealth","environmentalhealth"],"title":"A Robot-Based Tool for Physical and Cognitive Rehabilitation of Elderly People Using Biofeedback","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/robotbased-tool-physical-cognitive-rehabilitation-elderly-people-using-biofeedback"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7953275,"mean":6.7183323059095,"rank":3703075,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":4072366,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7953275,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257731,"mean":12.069138912815,"rank":121073,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":129890,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257731,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2989,"mean":7.3126050870147,"rank":1432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":1465,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2989,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237,"mean":3.9601271186441,"rank":78,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":156,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
