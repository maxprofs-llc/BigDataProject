These repeats, also called cortical motifs, were suggested to reflect a replay of sequential neuronal firing patterns. We searched for motifs in spontaneous activity, recorded from the rat barrel cortex and from the cat striate cortex of anesthetized animals, and found numerous repeating patterns of high similarity and repetition rates. To test their significance, various statistics were compared between physiological data and three different types of stochastic surrogate data that preserve dynamical characteristics of the recorded data. We found no evidence for the existence of deterministically generated cortical motifs. Rather, the stochastic properties of cortical motifs suggest that they appear by chance, as a result of the constraints imposed by the coarse dynamics of subthreshold ongoing activity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f61000319c","authors":["Alik Mokeichev","Michael Okun","Omri Barak","Yonatan Katz","Ohad Ben-Shahar","Ilan Lampl"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neuron.2007.01.017","issns":["0896-6273"],"issue":"3","journal":"Neuron","last_mentioned_on":1173398400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17270737"],"pmid":"17270737","pubdate":"2007-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Stochastic emergence of repeating cortical motifs in spontaneous membrane potential fluctuations in vivo.","type":"article","volume":"53","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/stochastic-emergence-repeating-cortical-motifs-spontaneous-membrane-potential-fluctuations-vivo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628077,"mean":4.9442940120368,"rank":2017703,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":934641,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628077,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2726387,"mean":5.2301901799699,"rank":1477611,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":740262,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2726387,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3775,"mean":10.09341600424,"rank":2368,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":639,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3775,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2903,"mean":8.5366312887664,"rank":1608,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":544,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2903,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":5,"Professor > Associate Professor":23,"Researcher":73,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
