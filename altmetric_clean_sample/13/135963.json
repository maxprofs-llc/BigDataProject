By conditionally ablating Fak in skin epidermis and culturing Fak-null keratinocytes, we show that FAK is dispensable for epidermal adhesion and basement membrane assembly, both of which require alphabeta1 integrins. FAK is also dispensible for proliferation\/survival in enriched medium. In contrast, FAK functions downstream of alphabeta1 integrin in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and orchestrating polarized keratinocyte migration out of epidermal explants. Fak-null keratinocytes display an aberrant actin cytoskeleton, which is tightly associated with robust, peripheral focal adhesions and microtubules. We find that without FAK, Src, p190RhoGAP, and PKL-PIX-PAK, localization and\/or activation at focal adhesions are impaired, leading to elevated Rho activity, phosphorylation of myosin light chain kinase, and enhanced tensile stress fibers. We show that, together, these FAK-dependent activities are critical to control the turnover of focal adhesions, which is perturbed in the absence of FAK.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002ce3","authors":["Markus Schober","Srikala Raghavan","Maria Nikolova","Lisa Polak","H Amalia Pasolli","Hilary E Beggs","Louis F Reichardt","Elaine Fuchs"],"doi":"10.1083\/jcb.200608010","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0021-9525"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1185408000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17325207"],"pmcid":"PMC2064024","pmid":"17325207","pubdate":"2007-02-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Rockefeller University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Focal adhesion kinase modulates tension signaling to control actin and focal adhesion dynamics.","type":"article","volume":"176","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/focal-adhesion-kinase-modulates-tension-signaling-control-actin-focal-adhesion-dynamics"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634915,"mean":4.919334042571,"rank":2016288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":947389,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634915,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2730843,"mean":5.2093733141682,"rank":1476171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":750251,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2730843,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4073,"mean":3.2491134577603,"rank":2400,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":478,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4073,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2421,"mean":2.9283223140496,"rank":950,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":316,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2421,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":11,"Researcher":45,"Student  > Ph.
