These motifs have been intensively investigated on the DNA level, but their overall biological relevance remains elusive. Only recently has research concerning the function of G-quadruplexes in RNAs commenced. Here, we demonstrate for the first time, that an RNA G-quadruplex structure inhibits translation in vivo in eukaryotic cells. We investigated the function of a highly conserved, thermodynamically stable RNA G-quadruplex in the 5'-UTR of the mRNA of the human Zic-1 zinc-finger protein. Using dual luciferase reporter assay, we demonstrate that the Zic-1 RNA G-quadruplex represses protein synthesis inside eukaryotic cells. Quantitative RT-PCR assays confirmed that the reduction of protein synthesis is due to regulation of the translation process and not a consequence of reduced transcription. Western blot analysis revealed that expression of Zic-1 is strongly reduced by a 73 nucleotides-long fragment of the UTR containing the G-quadruplex motif. These structures might add to the more recently discovered elements in untranslated regions of mRNAs that regulate their translation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f610008844","authors":["Amit Arora","Mariola Dutkiewicz","Vinod Scaria","Manoj Hariharan","Souvik Maiti","Jens Kurreck"],"doi":"10.1261\/rna.1001708","issns":["1469-9001"],"issue":"7","journal":"RNA","last_mentioned_on":1219276800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18515550"],"pmid":"18515550","pubdate":"2008-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Inhibition of translation in living eukaryotic cells by an RNA G-quadruplex motif.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inhibition-translation-living-eukaryotic-cells-rna-gquadruplex-motif"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628445,"mean":4.9414395978041,"rank":2017318,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":935851,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628445,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2726613,"mean":5.2277140333894,"rank":1477341,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":741182,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2726613,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1319,"mean":2.8545417298938,"rank":1039,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1319,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":929,"mean":2.8408685344828,"rank":690,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":929,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":21,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
