Outside the HLA region, the most significant finding (rs13119723; P = 2.0 x 10(-7)) was in the KIAA1109-TENR-IL2-IL21 linkage disequilibrium block. We independently confirmed association in two further collections (strongest association at rs6822844, 24 kb 5' of IL21; meta-analysis P = 1.3 x 10(-14), odds ratio = 0.63), suggesting that genetic variation in this region predisposes to celiac disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003164","authors":["David A van Heel","Lude Franke","Karen A Hunt","Rhian Gwilliam","Alexandra Zhernakova","Mike Inouye","Martin C Wapenaar","Martin C N M Barnardo","Graeme Bethel","Geoffrey K T Holmes","Con Feighery","Derek Jewell","Dermot Kelleher","Parveen Kumar","Simon Travis","Julian R F Walters","David S Sanders","Peter Howdle","Jill Swift","Raymond J Playford","William M McLaren","M Luisa Mearin","Chris J Mulder","Ross McManus","Ralph McGinnis","Lon R Cardon","Panos Deloukas","Cisca Wijmenga","van Heel DA","Franke L","Hunt KA","Gwilliam R","Zhernakova A","Inouye M","Wapenaar MC","Barnardo MC","Bethel G","Holmes GK","Feighery C","Jewell D","Kelleher D","Kumar P","Travis S","Walters JR","Sanders DS","Howdle P","Swift J","Playford RJ","McLaren WM","Mearin ML","Mulder CJ","McManus R","McGinnis R","Cardon LR","Deloukas P","Wijmenga C","Julian RF Walters"],"doi":"10.1038\/ng2058","endpage":"829","issns":["1061-4036","1546-1718"],"issue":"7","journal":"Nature Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1207085947,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17558408","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ng\/journal\/v39\/n7\/abs\/ng2058.html","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2274985","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ng\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/ng2058.html"],"pmcid":"PMC2274985","pmid":"17558408","pubdate":"2007-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"827","subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"A genome-wide association study for celiac disease identifies risk variants in the region harboring IL2 and IL21","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/ng2058","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genomewide-association-study-celiac-disease-identifies-risk-variants-region-harboring-il2-il21"},"altmetric_score":{"score":23.976,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":23.976},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7999356,"mean":6.7460883781203,"rank":338565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":7660962,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7999356,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7363227,"mean":7.0668064313069,"rank":330650,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":7032566,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7363227,"percentile":95},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4482,"mean":25.128504351707,"rank":915,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":3567,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4482,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4476,"mean":25.190325363128,"rank":914,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":3562,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4476,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":18,"Researcher":46,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
