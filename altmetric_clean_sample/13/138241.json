We demonstrated that the 5'-triphosphate end of RNA generated by viral polymerases is responsible for retinoic acid-inducible protein I (RIG-I)-mediated detection of RNA molecules. Detection of 5'-triphosphate RNA is abrogated by capping of the 5'-triphosphate end or by nucleoside modification of RNA, both occurring during posttranscriptional RNA processing in eukaryotes. Genomic RNA prepared from a negative-strand RNA virus and RNA prepared from virus-infected cells (but not from noninfected cells) triggered a potent interferon-alpha response in a phosphatase-sensitive manner. 5'-triphosphate RNA directly binds to RIG-I. Thus, uncapped 5'-triphosphate RNA (now termed 3pRNA) present in viruses known to be recognized by RIG-I, but absent in viruses known to be detected by MDA-5 such as the picornaviruses, serves as the molecular signature for the detection of viral infection by RIG-I.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2006Sci...314..964H","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["Veit Hornung","Jana Ellegast","Sarah Kim","Krzysztof Brz\u00f3zka","Andreas Jung","Hiroki Kato","Hendrik Poeck","Shizuo Akira","Karl-Klaus Conzelmann","Martin Schlee","Stefan Endres","Gunther Hartmann"],"doi":"10.1126\/science.1132505","issns":["1095-9203"],"issue":"5801","journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":1430813749,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17038590"],"pmid":"17038590","pubdate":"2006-11-10T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"5'-Triphosphate RNA is the ligand for RIG-I.","type":"article","volume":"314","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/5triphosphate-rna-ligand-rigi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8059254,"mean":6.8391404707078,"rank":1695043,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6351686,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8059254,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7422133,"mean":7.1654713920449,"rank":1616093,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":5793725,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7422133,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40900,"mean":32.69865400132,"rank":21200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":19588,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40900,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38185,"mean":34.73305620155,"rank":20889,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":17187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38185,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":20,"Student  > Doctoral Student":28,"Researcher":88,"Student  > Ph.
