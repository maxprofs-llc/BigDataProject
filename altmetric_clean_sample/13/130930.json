However, bioinformatic analysis revealed that many prokaryotic species that encode GSH-dependent proteins lack the gene for this enzyme. To understand how bacteria cope without gshA, we isolated Escherichia coli \u0394gshA multigenic suppressors that accumulated physiological levels of GSH. Mutations in both proB and proA, the first two genes in L-proline biosynthesis, provided a new pathway for \u03b3-glutamyl cysteine formation via the selective interception of ProB-bound \u03b3-glutamyl phosphate by amino acid thiols, likely through an S-to-N acyl shift mechanism. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that the L-proline biosynthetic pathway may have a second role in \u03b3-glutamyl cysteine formation in prokaryotes. Also, we showed that this mechanism could be exploited to generate cytoplasmic redox buffers bioorthogonal to GSH.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f610004264","authors":["Karthik Veeravalli","Dana Boyd","Brent L Iverson","Jon Beckwith","George Georgiou"],"doi":"10.1038\/nchembio.499","funders":["phs","nigms"],"issns":["1552-4469"],"issue":"2","journal":"Nature Chemical Biology","last_mentioned_on":1299542400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21186348"],"pmid":"21186348","pubdate":"2011-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry","biology"],"title":"Laboratory evolution of glutathione biosynthesis reveals natural compensatory pathways.","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/laboratory-evolution-glutathione-biosynthesis-reveals-natural-compensatory-pathways"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626860,"mean":4.9517239589446,"rank":2018734,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":931057,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626860,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2724812,"mean":5.2344175746526,"rank":1477960,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":737310,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2724812,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1039,"mean":9.3427456647399,"rank":717,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":165,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1039,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1031,"mean":9.3550757281553,"rank":711,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":164,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1031,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":30,"Student  > Ph.
