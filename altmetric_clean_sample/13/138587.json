Intracerebral injection of dilute, amyloid-beta (Abeta)-containing brain extracts from humans with Alzheimer's disease or beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice induced cerebral beta-amyloidosis and associated pathology in APP transgenic mice in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The seeding activity of brain extracts was reduced or abolished by Abeta immunodepletion, protein denaturation, or by Abeta immunization of the host. The phenotype of the exogenously induced amyloidosis depended on both the host and the source of the agent, suggesting the existence of polymorphic Abeta strains with varying biological activities reminiscent of prion strains.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2006Sci...313.1781M","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["Melanie Meyer-Luehmann","Janaky Coomaraswamy","Tristan Bolmont","Stephan Kaeser","Claudia Schaefer","Ellen Kilger","Anton Neuenschwander","Dorothee Abramowski","Peter Frey","Anneliese L Jaton","Jean-Marie Vigouret","Paolo Paganetti","Dominic M Walsh","Paul M Mathews","Jorge Ghiso","Matthias Staufenbiel","Lary C Walker","Mathias Jucker","Anneliese L.
