Dentin matrix protein 1 (encoded by DMP1) is highly expressed in osteocytes and, when deleted in mice, results in a hypomineralized bone phenotype. We investigated the potential for this gene not only to direct skeletal mineralization but also to regulate phosphate (P(i)) homeostasis. Both Dmp1-null mice and individuals with a newly identified disorder, autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets, manifest rickets and osteomalacia with isolated renal phosphate-wasting associated with elevated fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels and normocalciuria. Mutational analyses showed that autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets family carried a mutation affecting the DMP1 start codon, and a second family carried a 7-bp deletion disrupting the highly conserved DMP1 C terminus. Mechanistic studies using Dmp1-null mice demonstrated that absence of DMP1 results in defective osteocyte maturation and increased FGF23 expression, leading to pathological changes in bone mineralization. Our findings suggest a bone-renal axis that is central to guiding proper mineral metabolism.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003164","authors":["Jian Q Feng","Leanne M Ward","Shiguang Liu","Yongbo Lu","Yixia Xie","Baozhi Yuan","Xijie Yu","Frank Rauch","Siobhan I Davis","Shubin Zhang","Hector Rios","Marc K Drezner","L Darryl Quarles","Lynda F Bonewald","Kenneth E White"],"doi":"10.1038\/ng1905","issns":["1061-4036"],"issue":"11","journal":"Nature Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1185494400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17033621"],"pmid":"17033621","pubdate":"2006-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Loss of DMP1 causes rickets and osteomalacia and identifies a role for osteocytes in mineral metabolism.","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/loss-dmp1-causes-rickets-osteomalacia-identifies-role-osteocytes-mineral-metabolism"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627006,"mean":4.9509722374284,"rank":2018660,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":931387,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627006,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2724909,"mean":5.2341667740732,"rank":1477917,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":737561,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2724909,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3770,"mean":12.610422923852,"rank":2977,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":291,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3770,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3767,"mean":12.602081784387,"rank":2974,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":291,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3767,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Researcher":24,"Student  > Ph.
