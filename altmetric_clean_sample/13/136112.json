We identified an important component for controlled actin assembly, abelson interacting protein-1 (Abi-1), as a binding partner for the postsynaptic density (PSD) protein ProSAP2\/Shank3. During early neuronal development, Abi-1 is localized in neurites and growth cones; at later stages, the protein is enriched in dendritic spines and PSDs, as are components of a trimeric complex consisting of Abi-1, Eps8 and Sos-1. Abi-1 translocates upon NMDA application from PSDs to nuclei. Nuclear entry depends on abelson kinase activity. Abi-1 co-immunoprecipitates with the transcription factor complex of Myc\/Max proteins and enhances E-box-regulated gene transcription. Downregulation of Abi-1 by small interfering RNA results in excessive dendrite branching, immature spine and synapse morphology and a reduction of synapses, whereas overexpression of Abi-1 has the opposite effect. Data show that Abi-1 can act as a specific synapto-nuclear messenger and is essentially involved in dendrite and synapse formation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027b6","authors":["Christian Proepper","Svenja Johannsen","Stefan Liebau","Janine Dahl","Bianca Vaida","Juergen Bockmann","Michael R Kreutz","Eckart D Gundelfinger","Tobias M Boeckers"],"doi":"10.1038\/sj.emboj.7601569","issns":["0261-4189"],"issue":"5","journal":"EMBO Journal","last_mentioned_on":1259995761,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17304222","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1817621"],"pmid":"17304222","pubdate":"2007-03-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"Abelson interacting protein 1 (Abi-1) is essential for dendrite morphogenesis and synapse formation","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/abelson-interacting-protein-1-abi1-essential-dendrite-morphogenesis-synapse-formation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632750,"mean":4.9231796234803,"rank":680288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":2928787,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632750,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2729309,"mean":5.2116503084336,"rank":553740,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":2154475,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2729309,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3999,"mean":3.1875772886443,"rank":394,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":3455,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3999,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2669,"mean":2.7892046476762,"rank":270,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":2253,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2669,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
