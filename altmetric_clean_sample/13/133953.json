The tonB1 mutant was also found to produce significantly lower cell-free and cell-associated levels of the quorum sensing (QS) signal molecule 3-oxo-C12-AHL. Altered biofilm and motility phenotypes were restored to wildtype with the addition of exogenous N-acylhomoserine lactones. These functions were independent of the role of TonB1 in iron uptake. This is the first time that a link has been established between TonB1 activity and QS.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028c4","authors":["Abdelhamid Abbas","Claire Adams","Norma Scully","Jeremy Glennon","Fergal O'Gara"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1574-6968.2007.00845.x","issns":["0378-1097","03781097","15746968"],"issue":"2","journal":"FEMS Microbiology Letters","last_mentioned_on":1185235200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17623027"],"pmid":"17623027","pubdate":"2007-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"A role for TonB1 in biofilm formation and quorum sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/femsle\/article-lookup\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1574-6968.2007.00845.x","volume":"274","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-tonb1-biofilm-formation-quorum-sensing-pseudomonas-aeruginosa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628371,"mean":4.9417862081361,"rank":2017336,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":935783,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628371,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2726601,"mean":5.2276790523025,"rank":1477348,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":741127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2726601,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":801,"mean":2.380765,"rank":481,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":202,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":801,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":487,"mean":2.1936872427984,"rank":225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":159,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":487,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
