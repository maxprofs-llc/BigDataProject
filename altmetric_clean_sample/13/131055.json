Ligand binding induces presenilin-dependent cleavage of the receptor and a subsequent nuclear translocation of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). In the nucleus, NICD binds to the recombination signal sequence-binding protein J (RBP-J)\/CBF-1 transcription factor to induce expression of Notch target genes. Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of RBP-J interacting and tubulin associated (RITA) (C12ORF52) as a novel RBP-J\/CBF-1-interacting protein. RITA is a highly conserved 36 kDa protein that, most interestingly, binds to tubulin in the cytoplasm and shuttles rapidly between cytoplasm and nucleus. This shuttling RITA exports RBP-J\/CBF-1 from the nucleus. Functionally, we show that RITA can reverse a Notch-induced loss of primary neurogenesis in Xenopus laevis. Furthermore, RITA is able to downregulate Notch-mediated transcription. Thus, we propose that RITA acts as a negative modulator of the Notch signalling pathway, controlling the level of nuclear RBP-J\/CBF-1, where its amounts are limiting.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027b6","authors":["Stephan Armin Wacker","Cristobal Alvarado","G\u00f6tz von Wichert","Uwe Knippschild","J\u00f6rg Wiedenmann","Karen Clauss","Gerd Ulrich Nienhaus","Horst Hameister","Bernd Baumann","Tilman Borggrefe","Walter Kn\u00f6chel","Franz Oswald"],"doi":"10.1038\/emboj.2010.289","issns":["1460-2075"],"issue":"1","journal":"EMBO Journal","last_mentioned_on":1298851200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21102556"],"pmid":"21102556","pubdate":"2011-01-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"RITA, a novel modulator of Notch signalling, acts via nuclear export of RBP-J.","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rita-novel-modulator-notch-signalling-acts-via-nuclear-export-rbpj"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630679,"mean":4.9289340563991,"rank":2015494,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":942523,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630679,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2728238,"mean":5.2160185819674,"rank":1475930,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":746491,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2728238,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3999,"mean":3.1896458229115,"rank":2499,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":558,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3999,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2669,"mean":2.7922451274363,"rank":1301,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":445,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2669,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
