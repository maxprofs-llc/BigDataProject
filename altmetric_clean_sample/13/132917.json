Here we describe a genome-wide association scan for sequence variants affecting eosinophil counts in blood of 9,392 Icelanders. The most significant SNPs were studied further in 12,118 Europeans and 5,212 East Asians. SNPs at 2q12 (rs1420101), 2q13 (rs12619285), 3q21 (rs4857855), 5q31 (rs4143832) and 12q24 (rs3184504) reached genome-wide significance (P = 5.3 x 10(-14), 5.4 x 10(-10), 8.6 x 10(-17), 1.2 x 10(-10) and 6.5 x 10(-19), respectively). A SNP at IL1RL1 associated with asthma (P = 5.5 x 10(-12)) in a collection of ten different populations (7,996 cases and 44,890 controls). SNPs at WDR36, IL33 and MYB that showed suggestive association with eosinophil counts were also associated with atopic asthma (P = 4.2 x 10(-6), 2.2 x 10(-5) and 2.4 x 10(-4), respectively). We also found that a nonsynonymous SNP at 12q24, in SH2B3, associated significantly (P = 8.6 x 10(-8)) with myocardial infarction in six different populations (6,650 cases and 40,621 controls).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003164","authors":["Daniel F Gudbjartsson","Unnur S Bjornsdottir","Eva Halapi","Anna Helgadottir","Patrick Sulem","Gudrun M Jonsdottir","Gudmar Thorleifsson","Hafdis Helgadottir","Valgerdur Steinthorsdottir","Hreinn Stefansson","Carolyn Williams","Jennie Hui","John Beilby","Nicole M Warrington","Alan James","Lyle J Palmer","Gerard H Koppelman","Andrea Heinzmann","Marcus Krueger","H Marike Boezen","Amanda Wheatley","Janine Altmuller","Hyoung Doo Shin","Soo-Taek Uh","Hyun Sub Cheong","Brynja Jonsdottir","David Gislason","Choon-Sik Park","Linda M Rasmussen","Celeste Porsbjerg","Jakob W Hansen","Vibeke Backer","Thomas Werge","Christer Janson","Ulla-Britt J\u00f6nsson","Maggie C Y Ng","Juliana Chan","Wing Yee So","Ronald Ma","Svati H Shah","Christopher B Granger","Arshed A Quyyumi","Allan I Levey","Viola Vaccarino","Muredach P Reilly","Daniel J Rader","Michael J A Williams","Andre M van Rij","Gregory T Jones","Elisabetta Trabetti","Giovanni Malerba","Pier Franco Pignatti","Attilio Boner","Lydia Pescollderungg","Domenico Girelli","Oliviero Olivieri","Nicola Martinelli","Bjorn R Ludviksson","Dora Ludviksdottir","Gudmundur I Eyjolfsson","David Arnar","Gudmundur Thorgeirsson","Klaus Deichmann","Philip J Thompson","Matthias Wjst","Ian P Hall","Dirkje S Postma","Thorarinn Gislason","Jeffrey Gulcher","Augustine Kong","Ingileif Jonsdottir","Unnur Thorsteinsdottir","Kari Stefansson","Gudbjartsson DF","Bjornsdottir US","Halapi E","Helgadottir A","Sulem P","Jonsdottir GM","Thorleifsson G","Helgadottir H","Steinthorsdottir V","Stefansson H","Williams C","Hui J","Beilby J","Warrington NM","James A","Palmer LJ","Koppelman GH","Heinzmann A","Krueger M","Boezen HM","Wheatley A","Altmuller J","Shin HD","Uh ST","Cheong HS","Jonsdottir B","Gislason D","Park CS","Rasmussen LM","Porsbjerg C","Hansen JW","Backer V","Werge T","Janson C","J\u00f6nsson UB","Ng MC","Chan J","So WY","Ma R","Shah SH","Granger CB","Quyyumi AA","Levey AI","Vaccarino V","Reilly MP","Rader DJ","Williams MJ","van Rij AM","Jones GT","Trabetti E","Malerba G","Pignatti PF","Boner A","Pescollderungg L","Girelli D","Olivieri O","Martinelli N","Ludviksson BR","Ludviksdottir D","Eyjolfsson GI","Arnar D","Thorgeirsson G","Deichmann K","Thompson PJ","Wjst M","Hall IP","Postma DS","Gislason T","Gulcher J","Kong A","Jonsdottir I","Thorsteinsdottir U","Stefansson K"],"doi":"10.1038\/ng.323","endpage":"347","handle":"2440\/88475","handles":["2440\/88475"],"issns":["1546-1718","1061-4036"],"issue":"3","journal":"Nature Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1298592000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19198610","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/ng.323","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1038\/ng.323"],"pmid":"19198610","pubdate":"2009-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"342","subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Sequence variants affecting eosinophil numbers associate with asthma and myocardial infarction","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/ng.323","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sequence-variants-affecting-eosinophil-numbers-associate-asthma-myocardial-infarction-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":18.08,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":18.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3930654,"mean":5.018001926844,"rank":163442,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":3763758,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3930654,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2965370,"mean":5.4994043652858,"rank":140305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":2826367,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2965370,"percentile":95},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3873,"mean":13.245063565891,"rank":574,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":3296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3873,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3871,"mean":13.236289038263,"rank":573,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":3295,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3871,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":24,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":11,"Researcher":45,"Student  > Ph.
