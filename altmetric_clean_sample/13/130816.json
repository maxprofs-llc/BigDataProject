Western diets are deficient in omega-3 fatty acids, and have excessive amounts of omega-6 fatty acids compared with the diet on which human beings evolved and their genetic patterns were established. Excessive amounts of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and a very high omega-6\/omega-3 ratio, as is found in today's Western diets, promote the pathogenesis of many diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, whereas increased levels of omega-3 PUFA (a low omega-6\/omega-3 ratio) exert suppressive effects. In the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, a ratio of 4\/1 was associated with a 70% decrease in total mortality. A ratio of 2.5\/1 reduced rectal cell proliferation in patients with colorectal cancer, whereas a ratio of 4\/1 with the same amount of omega-3 PUFA had no effect. The lower omega-6\/omega-3 ratio in women with breast cancer was associated with decreased risk. A ratio of 2-3\/1 suppressed inflammation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and a ratio of 5\/1 had a beneficial effect on patients with asthma, whereas a ratio of 10\/1 had adverse consequences. These studies indicate that the optimal ratio may vary with the disease under consideration. This is consistent with the fact that chronic diseases are multigenic and multifactorial. Therefore, it is quite possible that the therapeutic dose of omega-3 fatty acids will depend on the degree of severity of disease resulting from the genetic predisposition. A lower ratio of omega-6\/omega-3 fatty acids is more desirable in reducing the risk of many of the chronic diseases of high prevalence in Western societies, as well as in the developing countries, that are being exported to the rest of the world.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023ec","authors":["A P Simopoulos","Simopoulos, A P","A.P Simopoulos"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0753-3322(02)00253-6","endpage":"379","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0753-3322","07533322"],"issue":"8","journal":"Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1505904289,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12442909","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.sci-hub.org\/pubmed\/12442909?utm_content=buffer8b87b&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.sci-hub.org\/pubmed\/12442909?utm_content=buffer88c85&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12442909?utm_source=yahoo-food&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=content-partnerships","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12442909?utm_content=buffer9e02c&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12442909","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/12442909\/","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0753332202002536","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12442909\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/12442909\/"],"pmid":"12442909","pubdate":"2002-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"365","subjects":["medicine","biology","drugtherapy"],"title":"The importance of the ratio of omega-6\/omega-3 essential fatty acids.","type":"article","volume":"56","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/importance-ratio-omega6omega3-essential-fatty-acids"},"altmetric_score":{"score":598.21,"score_history":{"1y":202.98,"6m":65.75,"3m":44.5,"1m":3,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":598.21},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8440508,"mean":7.0976499018281,"rank":5778,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":8434755,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8440508,"percentile":99},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7807913,"mean":7.419736019046,"rank":5748,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":7802165,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7807913,"percentile":99},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":956,"mean":2.4534890052356,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":955,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":956,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":928,"mean":1.8359460625674,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":927,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":928,"percentile":99}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":77,"researcher":3,"practitioner":23,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":77,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":23,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":11,"Professor > Associate Professor":31,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":117,"Student  > Doctoral Student":56,"Student  > Ph.
