Sialic acid analogs are antiviral therapeutics as well as crucial tools in bacterial pathogenesis research, immunobiology and development of cancer diagnostic imaging. The scarce supply of sialic acid hinders production of these materials. We have developed an efficient, rapid and cost effective fermentation route to access sialic acid. Our approach uses low cost feedstock, produces an industrially relevant amount of sialic acid and is scalable to manufacturing levels. We have also shown that precursor directed biosynthesis can be used to produce a N-acyl sialic acid analog. This work demonstrates the feasibility of engineering manufacturing-friendly bacteria to produce complex, unavailable small molecules.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f6100083f3","authors":["Benjamin R Lundgren","Christopher N Boddy"],"doi":"10.1039\/b703519e","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1477-0520"],"issue":"12","journal":"Organic and Biomolecular Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1182124800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17551639"],"pmid":"17551639","pubdate":"2007-06-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"title":"Sialic acid and N-acyl sialic acid analog production by fermentation of metabolically and genetically engineered Escherichia coli.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sialic-acid-nacyl-sialic-acid-analog-production-fermentation-metabolically-genetically-engineered-es"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628302,"mean":4.942517914036,"rank":2017439,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":935509,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628302,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2726546,"mean":5.2281533934,"rank":1477429,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":740919,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2726546,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":997,"mean":3.1088955823293,"rank":521,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":288,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":997,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":681,"mean":2.8641823529412,"rank":312,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":216,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":681,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
