Germline mutations cause lethal autoimmune diseases in males. Serendipitously, we observed that female mice heterozygous for the \"scurfin\" mutation of the Foxp3 gene (Foxp3(sf\/+)) developed cancer at a high rate. The majority of the cancers were mammary carcinomas in which the wild-type Foxp3 allele was inactivated and HER-2\/ErbB2 was overexpressed. Foxp3 bound and repressed the HER-2\/ErbB2 promoter. Deletion, functionally significant somatic mutations, and downregulation of the FOXP3 gene were commonly found in human breast cancer samples and correlated significantly with HER-2\/ErbB2 overexpression, regardless of the status of HER-2 amplification. Our data demonstrate that FOXP3 is an X-linked breast cancer suppressor gene and an important regulator of the HER-2\/ErbB2 oncogene.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c1","authors":["Tao Zuo","Lizhong Wang","Carl Morrison","Xing Chang","Huiming Zhang","Weiquan Li","Yan Liu","Yin Wang","Xingluo Liu","Michael W Y Chan","Jin-Qing Liu","Richard Love","Chang-Gong Liu","Virginia Godfrey","Rulong Shen","Tim H-M Huang","Tianyu Yang","Bae Keun Park","Cun-Yu Wang","Pan Zheng","Yang Liu","Michael W.Y.
