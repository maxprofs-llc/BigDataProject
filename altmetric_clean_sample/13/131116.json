We show that a distinct population expressing CD133 (Prominin-1), which is highly enriched after administration of a chemotherapeutic drug, dacarbazine, has enhanced metastatic potential in vivo. CD133(+) tumor cells are located close to tumor-associated lymphatic vessels in metastatic organs such as the regional lymph nodes and lung. Lymphatic endothelial cells promote the migratory activity of a CD133(+) subset to target organs and regulation of lymphatic growth efficiently modulates the metastasis of CD133(+) tumor cells. We found that lymphatic vessels in metastatic tissues stimulate chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4)(+)\/CD133(+) cell metastasis to target organs by secretion of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1). The CXCR4(+)\/CD133(+) cells exhibited higher metastatic activity compared with CXCR4(-)\/CD133(+) cells and, importantly, blockade of CXCR4 coupled with dacarbazine efficiently inhibited both tumor growth and metastasis; dacarbazine alone could not attenuate tumor metastasis. The current study demonstrates a previously unidentified role of the lymphatic microenvironment in facilitating metastasis of chemoresistant melanoma cells via a specific chemotactic axis, SDF-1\/CXCR4. Our findings suggest that targeting the SDF-1\/CXCR4 axis in addition to dacarbazine treatment could therapeutically block chemoresistant CD133(+) cell metastasis toward a lymphatic metastatic niche.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dd4","authors":["Minah Kim","Young Jun Koh","Kyung Eun Kim","Bong Ihn Koh","Do-Hyun Nam","Kari Alitalo","Injune Kim","Gou Young Koh"],"doi":"10.1158\/0008-5472.can-10-2591","issns":["1538-7445"],"issue":"24","journal":"Cancer Research","last_mentioned_on":1297900800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21056990"],"pmid":"21056990","pubdate":"2010-12-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"CXCR4 signaling regulates metastasis of chemoresistant melanoma cells by a lymphatic metastatic niche.","type":"article","volume":"70","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cxcr4-signaling-regulates-metastasis-chemoresistant-melanoma-cells-lymphatic-metastatic-niche"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628118,"mean":4.9440792284301,"rank":2017648,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":934809,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628118,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2726417,"mean":5.2299040696678,"rank":1477572,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":740404,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2726417,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4930,"mean":4.09398214648,"rank":3174,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":984,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4930,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3517,"mean":3.9924982935154,"rank":2064,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":776,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3517,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":30,"Student  > Ph.
