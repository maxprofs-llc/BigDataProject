The ability to create synthetic riboswitches that control gene expression in response to any desired small-molecule ligand will enable the development of sensitive genetic screens that can detect the presence of small molecules, as well as designer genetic control elements to conditionally modulate cellular behavior. Herein, we present an automated high-throughput screening method that identifies synthetic riboswitches that display extremely low background levels of gene expression in the absence of the desired ligand and robust increases in expression in its presence. Mechanistic studies reveal how these riboswitches function and suggest design principles for creating new synthetic riboswitches. We anticipate that the screening method and design principles will be generally useful for creating functional synthetic riboswitches.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024f0","authors":["Sean A Lynch","Shawn K Desai","Hari Krishna Sajja","Justin P Gallivan"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.chembiol.2006.12.008","issns":["1074-5521"],"issue":"2","journal":"Chemistry & Biology","last_mentioned_on":1175731200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17317571"],"pmid":"17317571","pubdate":"2007-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry","biology","biochemistry"],"title":"A high-throughput screen for synthetic riboswitches reveals mechanistic insights into their function.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highthroughput-screen-synthetic-riboswitches-reveals-mechanistic-insights-function"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627387,"mean":4.9489064262842,"rank":2018370,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":932350,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627387,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2725249,"mean":5.2328001855268,"rank":1477746,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":738356,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2725249,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":767,"mean":4.1810939947781,"rank":450,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":140,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":767,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":563,"mean":3.4650854092527,"rank":289,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":126,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":563,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":33,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
