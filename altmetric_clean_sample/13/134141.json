With no lysine (K) (WNK) protein kinases interact with and activate the mammalian GCK-VI kinases proline-alanine-rich Ste20-related kinase (PASK) and oxidative stress-responsive 1 (OSR1). We demonstrate here for the first time that GCK-VI kinases play an essential role in whole animal osmoregulation. RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown of the single C. elegans GCK-VI kinase, GCK-3, dramatically inhibits systemic volume recovery and survival after hypertonic shrinkage. Tissue-specific RNAi suggests that GCK-3 functions primarily in the hypodermis and intestine to mediate volume recovery. The single C. elegans WNK kinase, WNK-1, binds to GCK-3, and wnk-1 knockdown gives rise to a phenotype qualitatively similar to that of gck-3(RNAi) worms. Knockdown of the two kinases together has no additive effect, suggesting that WNK-1 and GCK-3 function in a common pathway. We postulate that WNK-1 functions upstream of GCK-3 in a manner similar to that postulated for its mammalian homologs. Phylogenetic analysis of kinase functional domains suggests that the interaction between GCK-VI and WNK kinases first occurred in an early metazoan and therefore likely coincided with the need of multicellular animals to tightly regulate transepithelial transport processes that mediate systemic osmotic homeostasis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000220d","authors":["Keith P Choe","Kevin Strange"],"doi":"10.1152\/ajpcell.00126.2007","issns":["0363-6143"],"issue":"3","journal":"American Journal of Physiology: Cell Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1185148800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17596296"],"pmid":"17596296","pubdate":"2007-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","physiology"],"title":"Evolutionarily conserved WNK and Ste20 kinases are essential for acute volume recovery and survival after hypertonic shrinkage in Caenorhabditis elegans.","type":"article","volume":"293","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evolutionarily-conserved-wnk-ste20-kinases-essential-acute-volume-recovery-survival-after-hypertonic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628077,"mean":4.9442940120368,"rank":2017746,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":934545,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628077,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2726361,"mean":5.2301165847531,"rank":1477639,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":740190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2726361,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":635,"mean":2.230785488959,"rank":359,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":132,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":635,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":352,"mean":2.0361937321937,"rank":134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":352,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
