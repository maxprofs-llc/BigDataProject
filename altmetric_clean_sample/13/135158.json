In vivo, H-NS selectively silences specific genes of the bacterial chromosome. However, many studies have concluded that H-NS binds sequence-independently to DNA, leaving the molecular basis for its selectivity unexplained. We show that the negative regulatory element (NRE) of the supercoiling-sensitive Escherichia coliproU gene contains two identical high-affinity binding sites for H-NS. Cooperative binding of H-NS is abrogated by changes in DNA superhelical density and temperature. We further demonstrate that the high-affinity sites nucleate cooperative binding and establish a nucleoprotein structure required for silencing. Mutations in these sites result in loss of repression by H-NS. In this model, silencing at proU, and by inference at other genes directly regulated by H-NS, is tightly controlled by the cooperativity between bound H-NS molecules.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f61000316f","authors":["Emeline Bouffartigues","Malcolm Buckle","Cyril Badaut","Andrew Travers","Sylvie Rimsky"],"doi":"10.1038\/nsmb1233","issns":["1545-9993"],"issue":"5","journal":"Nature Structural & Molecular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1177632000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17435766"],"pmid":"17435766","pubdate":"2007-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"H-NS cooperative binding to high-affinity sites in a regulatory element results in transcriptional silencing.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hns-cooperative-binding-highaffinity-sites-regulatory-element-results-transcriptional-silencing"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628883,"mean":4.937418267118,"rank":2016407,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":938340,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628883,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2727159,"mean":5.2235668325814,"rank":1476735,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":743227,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2727159,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1507,"mean":5.2986401062417,"rank":910,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1507,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1499,"mean":5.2872483311081,"rank":902,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1499,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
