It is thought that the coordinated action of nuclear and cytoplasmic components of the localization machinery is required for the efficient export and subsequent subcellular localization of these mRNAs in the cytoplasm. Using quantitative poly(A)(+) and transcript-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization, we analyzed different nonessential nucleoporins and nuclear pore-associated proteins for their potential role in mRNA export and localization. We found that Nup60p, a nuclear pore protein located on the nucleoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex, was required for the mRNA localization pathway. In a \u0394nup60 background, localized mRNAs were preferentially retained within the nucleus compared to nonlocalized transcripts. However, the export block was only partial and some transcripts could still reach the cytoplasm. Importantly, downstream processes were also affected. Localization of ASH1 and IST2 mRNAs to the bud was impaired in the \u0394nup60 background, suggesting that the assembly of a localization competent mRNP (\"locasome\") was inhibited when NUP60 was deleted. These results demonstrate transcript specificity of a nuclear mRNA retention defect and identify a specific nucleoporin as a functional component of the localization pathway in budding yeast.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f610008844","authors":["Erin A Powrie","Daniel Zenklusen","Robert H Singer"],"doi":"10.1261\/rna.1210411","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["1469-9001"],"issue":"1","journal":"RNA","last_mentioned_on":1298851200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21036941"],"pmid":"21036941","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Lab","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"A nucleoporin, Nup60p, affects the nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of ASH1 mRNA in S. cerevisiae.","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nucleoporin-nup60p-affects-nuclear-cytoplasmic-localization-ash1-mrna-s-cerevisiae"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626860,"mean":4.9517239589446,"rank":2018748,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":931019,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626860,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2724803,"mean":5.2345594028507,"rank":1477970,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":737280,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2724803,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1316,"mean":2.8615817490494,"rank":1034,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":128,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1316,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":926,"mean":2.8473340540541,"rank":685,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":106,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":926,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
