Insulin and hypoglycemic agents have been used as standard therapeutic strategies. However, these are characterized by limited efficacy and adverse side effects, making the development of new therapeutic alternatives mandatory. Inhibition of glucose reabsorption in the kidney, mediated by SGLT1 or SGLT2, represents a promising therapeutic approach. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of thioglycosides on human SGLT1 and SGLT2. For this purpose, stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing human SGLT1 and SGLT2 were used. The inhibitory effect of thioglycosides was assessed in transport studies and membrane potential measurements, using alpha-methyl-glucoside uptake and fluorescence resonance energy transfer, respectively. We found that some thioglycosides inhibited hSGLT more strongly than phlorizin. Specifically, thioglycoside I (phenyl-1'-thio-beta-D-glucopyranoside) inhibited hSGLT2 stronger than hSGLT1 and to a larger extent than phlorizin. Thioglycoside VII (2-hydroxymethyl-phenyl-1'-thio-beta-D-galacto-pyranoside) had a pronounced inhibitory effect on hSGLT1 but not on hSGLT2. Kinetic studies confirmed the inhibitory effect of these thioglycosides on hSGLT1 or hSGLT2, demonstrating competitive inhibition as the mechanism of action. Therefore, these thioglycosides represent promising therapeutic agents for the control of hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f610007947","authors":["Francisco Castaneda","Antje Burse","Wilhelm Boland","Rolf K-H Kinne"],"issns":["1449-1907"],"issue":"3","journal":"International Journal of Medical Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1265177932,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17505558","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1868657"],"pmid":"17505558","pubdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Ivyspring International Publisher","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Thioglycosides as inhibitors of hSGLT1 and hSGLT2: Potential therapeutic agents for the control of hyperglycemia in diabetes","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/thioglycosides-inhibitors-hsglt1-hsglt2-potential-therapeutic-agents-control-hyperglycemia-diabetes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629479,"mean":4.9344089205159,"rank":816480,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290193,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629479,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2727373,"mean":5.2214520358827,"rank":657209,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":1718393,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2727373,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175,"mean":2.0728735632184,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":120,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171,"mean":2.0981176470588,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
