In rheumatoid arthritis, the synovium is the site of inflammation, and it participates in an organized tissue response that damages cartilage and bone. We identified cadherin-11 as essential for the development of the synovium. Cadherin-11-deficient mice have a hypoplastic synovial lining, display a disorganized synovial reaction to inflammation, and are resistant to inflammatory arthritis. Cadherin-11 therapeutics prevent and reduce arthritis in mouse models. Thus, synovial cadherin-11 determines the behavior of synovial cells in their proinflammatory and destructive tissue response in inflammatory arthritis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2007Sci...315.1006L","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["David M Lee","Hans P Kiener","Sandeep K Agarwal","Erika H Noss","Gerald F M Watts","Osamu Chisaka","Masatoshi Takeichi","Michael B Brenner"],"doi":"10.1126\/science.1137306","issns":["1095-9203"],"issue":"5814","journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":1173225600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17255475"],"pmid":"17255475","pubdate":"2007-02-16T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Cadherin-11 in synovial lining formation and pathology in arthritis.","type":"article","volume":"315","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cadherin11-synovial-lining-formation-pathology-arthritis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635015,"mean":4.9193540767705,"rank":2016539,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":947203,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635015,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2730856,"mean":5.2093996935061,"rank":1476322,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":750152,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2730856,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27897,"mean":20.958724404933,"rank":22406,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":3206,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27897,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23306,"mean":24.068342587428,"rank":18218,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":2818,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23306,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":30,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
