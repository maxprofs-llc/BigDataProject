The detection of human ATM protein at site-specific DSBs required functional NBS1 protein, ATM kinase activity and ATM autophosphorylation on Ser 1981. DSB formation led to the localized disruption of nucleosomes, a process that depended on both functional NBS1 and ATM. These two proteins were also required for efficient recruitment of the repair cofactor XRCC4 to DSBs, and for efficient DSB repair. These results demonstrate the functional importance of ATM kinase activity and phosphorylation in the response to DSBs, and support a model in which ordered chromatin structure changes that occur after DNA breakage depend on functional NBS1 and ATM, and facilitate DNA DSB repair.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003163","authors":["Elijahu Berkovich","Raymond J Monnat","Michael B Kastan","Berkovich E","Monnat RJ Jr","Kastan MB","Raymond J.
