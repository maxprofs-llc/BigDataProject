However, the assumption that these sensations are pleasurable was not tested and may have biased the results.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033ea","authors":["Reuven Dar","Rachel Kaplan","Lior Shaham","Hanan Frenk"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00213-006-0662-2","issns":["0033-3158"],"issue":"2","journal":"Psychopharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1176940800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17235611"],"pmid":"17235611","pubdate":"2007-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["psychiatry","pharmacology"],"title":"Euphoriant effects of nicotine in smokers: fact or artifact?","type":"article","volume":"191","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/euphoriant-effects-nicotine-smokers-fact-artifact"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629660,"mean":4.9331369641107,"rank":2015916,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":940279,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629660,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2727527,"mean":5.2197869791197,"rank":1476209,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":744745,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2727527,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1780,"mean":3.7351512085441,"rank":1134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":428,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1780,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1503,"mean":3.9583781624501,"rank":904,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":387,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1503,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
