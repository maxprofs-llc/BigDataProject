Phosphoisoforms of Rb and LAP2alpha are down-regulated in G(0). Although RbS780 phosphoform and LAP2alpha are up-regulated upon reentry into G(1) and colocalize in the nucleoplasm, RbS795 migrates between nucleoplasmic and speckle compartments. In HDFs, which are null for lamins A\/C, LAP2alpha is mislocalized within nuclear aggregates, and this is correlated with cell cycle arrest and accumulation of Rb within speckles. Nuclear retention of nucleoplasmic Rb during G(1) phase but not of speckle-associated Rb depends on lamin A\/C. siRNA knock down of LAP2alpha or lamin A\/C in HDFs leads to accumulation of Rb in speckles and G(1) arrest, probably because of activation of a cell cycle checkpoint. Our results suggest that LAP2alpha and lamin A\/C are involved in controlling Rb localization and phosphorylation, and a lack or mislocalization of either protein leads to cell cycle arrest in HDFs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002ce3","authors":["Vanja Pekovic","Jens Harborth","Jos L V Broers","Frans C S Ramaekers","Baziel van Engelen","Martin Lammens","Thomas von Zglinicki","Roland Foisner","Chris Hutchison","Ewa Markiewicz","Pekovic V","Harborth J","Broers JL","Ramaekers FC","van Engelen B","Lammens M","von Zglinicki T","Foisner R","Hutchison C","Markiewicz E","Jos L.V.
