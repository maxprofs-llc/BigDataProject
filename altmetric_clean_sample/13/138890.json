The complete sequence of this plasmid allowed the mapping of previously known functions including replication, conjugation, bacteriocin resistance, heavy metal tolerance, and bacteriophage resistance. In addition, functions for cold shock adaptation and DNA damage repair were identified, further confirming pNP40's contribution to environmental stress protection. A plasmid cointegration event appears to have been part of the evolution of pNP40, resulting in a \"stockpiling\" of bacteriophage resistance systems.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cba","authors":["Jonathan O'Driscoll","Frances Glynn","Gerald F Fitzgerald","Douwe van Sinderen"],"doi":"10.1128\/jb.00672-06","issns":["0021-9193"],"issue":"18","journal":"Journal of Bacteriology","last_mentioned_on":1163116800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16952955"],"pmid":"16952955","pubdate":"2006-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society for Microbiology","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["bacteriology"],"title":"Sequence analysis of the lactococcal plasmid pNP40: a mobile replicon for coping with environmental hazards.","type":"article","volume":"188","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sequence-analysis-lactococcal-plasmid-pnp40-mobile-replicon-coping-environmental-hazards"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629660,"mean":4.9331369641107,"rank":2015930,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":940245,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629660,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2727520,"mean":5.2199146051818,"rank":1476217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":744721,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2727520,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3028,"mean":2.725710604559,"rank":1922,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":613,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3028,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2238,"mean":2.6606115333035,"rank":1237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":549,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2238,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Ph.
