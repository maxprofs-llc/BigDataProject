Iterative structure-based design was supported by protein-ligand structure determinations using a PKA-PKB \"chimera\" and a final protein-ligand structure of a lead compound in PKBbeta itself.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e47","authors":["Gordon Saxty","Steven J Woodhead","Valerio Berdini","Thomas G Davies","Marcel L Verdonk","Paul G Wyatt","Robert G Boyle","David Barford","Robert Downham","Michelle D Garrett","Robin A Carr","Gordon Saxty,\u2021"],"doi":"10.1021\/jm070091b","endpage":"2296","issns":["0022-2623","1520-4804"],"issue":"10","journal":"Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1385995440,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17451234","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jm070091b"],"pmid":"17451234","pubdate":"2007-05-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"ACS Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"2293","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Identification of Inhibitors of Protein Kinase B Using Fragment-Based Lead Discovery\u2020","type":"article","volume":"50","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-inhibitors-protein-kinase-b-using-fragmentbased-lead-discovery-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.808,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.808},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8015599,"mean":6.7744178899646,"rank":577931,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7438033,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8015599,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7379639,"mean":7.0980552720842,"rank":561754,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":6817868,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7379639,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3945,"mean":4.3449219066937,"rank":166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":3779,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3945,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3725,"mean":4.3773646616541,"rank":159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":3566,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3725,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":30,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
