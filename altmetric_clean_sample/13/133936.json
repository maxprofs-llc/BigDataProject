Thus, the use of selective beta3-AR agonists in the pharmacological treatment of overactive bladder is being explored. The present studies investigated the effects of a novel selective beta3-AR agonist, (R)-3'-[[2-[[2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]amino]ethyl]amino]-[1,1'-biphenyl]-3-carboxylic acid (GW427353; solabegron) on bladder function in the dog using in vitro and in vivo techniques. GW427353 stimulated cAMP accumulation in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the human beta3-AR, with an EC50 value of 22 +\/- 6 nM and an intrinsic activity 90% of isoproterenol. At concentrations of 10,000 nM, GW427353 produced a minimal response in cells expressing either beta1-ARs or beta2-ARs (maximum response <10% of that to isoproterenol). In dog isolated bladder strips, GW427353 evoked relaxation that was attenuated by the nonselective beta-AR antagonist bupranolol and 1-(2-ethylphenoxy)-3-[[(1S)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthalenyl]amino]-(2S)-2-propanol (SR59230A) (reported to have beta3-AR antagonist activity). The relaxation was unaffected by atenolol, a selective beta1-AR antagonist, or (+\/-)-1-[2,3-(dihydro-7-methyl-1H-inden-4-yl)oxy]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-butanol (ICI 118551), a selective beta2-AR antagonist. GW427353 increased the volume required to evoke micturition in the anesthetized dog following acetic acid-evoked bladder irritation, without affecting the ability of the bladder to void. GW427353-evoked effects on bladder parameters in vivo were inhibited by bupranolol. The present study demonstrates that selective activation of beta3-AR with GW427353 evokes bladder relaxation and facilitates bladder storage mechanisms in the dog.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007de2","authors":["Alexandra Hicks","Gerald P McCafferty","Erin Riedel","Nambi Aiyar","Mark Pullen","Christopher Evans","Trudy D Luce","Robert W Coatney","Gian C Rivera","Timothy D Westfall","J Paul Hieble"],"doi":"10.1124\/jpet.107.125757","issns":["0022-3565"],"issue":"1","journal":"The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1294092800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17626794"],"pmid":"17626794","pubdate":"2007-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"GW427353 (solabegron), a novel, selective beta3-adrenergic receptor agonist, evokes bladder relaxation and increases micturition reflex threshold in the dog.","type":"article","volume":"323","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gw427353-solabegron-novel-selective-beta3adrenergic-receptor-agonist-evokes-bladder-relaxation-incre"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3931246,"mean":5.0178691345573,"rank":748547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":3152478,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3931246,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2965444,"mean":5.4985725040938,"rank":621196,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":2323437,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2965444,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1610,"mean":2.8662013673089,"rank":151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":1437,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1610,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1122,"mean":2.9148153434434,"rank":137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":967,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1122,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
