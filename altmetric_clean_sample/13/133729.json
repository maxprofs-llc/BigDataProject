However, partly due to a lack of structural information on the Bax homo-oligomerization and apoptosis inducing domain(s), this hypothesis has remained difficult to test. In this study, we identified a three-helix unit, comprised of the BH3 (helix 2) and BH1 domains (helix 4 and helix 5), as the homo-oligomerization domain of Bax. When targeted to mitochondria, this minimum oligomerization unit induced apoptosis in Bax(-\/-)Bak(-\/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (DKO). Strikingly, the central helix of Bax (helix 5), when replacing the corresponding helix (helix 5) of Bcl-xL, an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein structurally homologous to Bax, converted Bcl-xL into a Bax-like molecule capable of forming oligomers and causing apoptosis in the DKO cells. Finally, a series of systematic mutagenesis analyses revealed that homo-oligomerization is both necessary and sufficient for the apoptotic activity of Bax. These results suggest that active Bax causes mitochondrial damage through homo-oligomers of a three-helix functional unit.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f61000293c","authors":["Nicholas M George","Jacquelynn J D Evans","Xu Luo"],"doi":"10.1101\/gad.1553607","issns":["0890-9369"],"issue":"15","journal":"Genes & Development","last_mentioned_on":1188950400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17671092"],"pmid":"17671092","pubdate":"2007-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"A three-helix homo-oligomerization domain containing BH3 and BH1 is responsible for the apoptotic activity of Bax.","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/threehelix-homooligomerization-domain-containing-bh3-bh1-responsible-apoptotic-activity-bax"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3616992,"mean":4.9289391557822,"rank":2015379,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":924739,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3616992,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2715211,"mean":5.1653902283823,"rank":1474082,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":731958,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2715211,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2541,"mean":3.0136763779528,"rank":1421,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":276,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2541,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1717,"mean":2.8058939393939,"rank":714,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":185,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1717,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
