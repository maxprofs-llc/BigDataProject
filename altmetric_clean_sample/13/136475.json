Here, we report that MARCH-I, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, plays a pivotal role in the post-translational regulation of MHC II in B cells. MARCH-I expression was particularly high in B cells, and the forced expression of MARCH-I induced the ubiquitination of MHC II. In B cells from MARCH-I-deficient mice (MARCH-I KO), the half-life of surface MHC II was prolonged and the ubiquitinated form of MHC II completely disappeared. In addition, MARCH-I-deficient B cells highly expressed exogenous antigen-loaded MHC II on their surface and showed high ability to present exogenous antigens. These results suggest that the function of MHC II in B cells is regulated through ubiquitination by MARCH-I.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027b6","authors":["Yohei Matsuki","Mari Ohmura-Hoshino","Eiji Goto","Masami Aoki","Mari Mito-Yoshida","Mika Uematsu","Takanori Hasegawa","Haruhiko Koseki","Osamu Ohara","Manabu Nakayama","Kiminori Toyooka","Ken Matsuoka","Hak Hotta","Akitsugu Yamamoto","Satoshi Ishido"],"doi":"10.1038\/sj.emboj.7601556","issns":["0261-4189"],"issue":"3","journal":"EMBO Journal","last_mentioned_on":1457308800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17255932"],"pmid":"17255932","pubdate":"2007-02-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"Novel regulation of MHC class II function in B cells.","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-regulation-mhc-class-ii-function-b-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4869733,"mean":5.7965197477024,"rank":2583702,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1627085,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4869733,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3845973,"mean":6.539166921656,"rank":2117260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1193932,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3845973,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3915,"mean":4.1748226877874,"rank":2628,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3915,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2973,"mean":4.2345753701211,"rank":1714,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2973,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
