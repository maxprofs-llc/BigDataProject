CHL1 gene ablation resulted in reduced targeting of Hsc70 to the synaptic plasma membrane and synaptic vesicles, suggesting CHL1 as a synapse-targeting cue for Hsc70. CHL1 accumulates in presynaptic membranes and, in response to synapse activation, is targeted to synaptic vesicles by endocytosis. CHL1 deficiency or disruption of the CHL1\/Hsc70 complex results in accumulation of abnormally high levels of clathrin-coated synaptic vesicles with a reduced ability to release clathrin. Generation of new clathrin-coated synaptic vesicles in an activity-dependent manner is inhibited when the CHL1\/Hsc70 complex is disrupted, resulting in impaired uptake and release of FM dyes in synaptic boutons. Abnormalities in clathrin-dependent synaptic vesicle recycling may thus underlie brain malfunctions in humans and mice that carry mutations in the CHL1 gene.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f61000319c","authors":["Iryna Leshchyns'ka","Vladimir Sytnyk","Melanie Richter","Aksana Andreyeva","Dmytro Puchkov","Melitta Schachner","Leshchyns'ka I","Sytnyk V","Richter M","Andreyeva A","Puchkov D","Schachner M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neuron.2006.10.020","endpage":"1025","issns":["0896-6273","08966273"],"issue":"6","journal":"Neuron","last_mentioned_on":1169769600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17178404"],"pmid":"17178404","pubdate":"2006-12-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"1011","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"The adhesion molecule CHL1 regulates uncoating of clathrin-coated synaptic vesicles.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0896627306008208","volume":"52","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adhesion-molecule-chl1-regulates-uncoating-clathrincoated-synaptic-vesicles"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629283,"mean":4.9355109985986,"rank":2016298,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":939011,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629283,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2727251,"mean":5.2224236304003,"rank":1476535,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":743742,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2727251,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3775,"mean":10.061395866455,"rank":2366,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":642,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3775,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2904,"mean":8.5186923871857,"rank":1607,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":547,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2904,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
