Here we demonstrate that absence of the gene encoding the forkhead transcription factor Foxp1 resulted in a profound defect in early B cell development. Foxp1 deficiency was associated with decreased expression of all B lineage genes in B220+ fetal liver cells as well as with a block in the transition from pro-B cell to pre-B cell involving diminished expression of recombination-activating genes 1 and 2. Foxp1 bound to the Erag enhancer and was involved in controlling variable-(diversity)-joining recombination of the gene encoding immunoglobulin heavy chain in a B cell lineage-specific way. Our results identify Foxp1 as an essential participant in the transcriptional regulatory network of B lymphopoiesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003165","authors":["Hui Hu","Bin Wang","Madhuri Borde","Julie Nardone","Shan Maika","Laura Allred","Philip W Tucker","Anjana Rao"],"doi":"10.1038\/ni1358","issns":["1529-2908"],"issue":"8","journal":"Nature Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1174521600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16819554"],"pmid":"16819554","pubdate":"2006-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Foxp1 is an essential transcriptional regulator of B cell development.","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/foxp1-essential-transcriptional-regulator-b-cell-development"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635033,"mean":4.9228440290343,"rank":2018184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":945358,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635033,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2731475,"mean":5.2136327707703,"rank":1477824,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":748955,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2731475,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1557,"mean":4.8513547557841,"rank":798,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1557,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1553,"mean":4.7300412371134,"rank":794,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1553,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":24,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
