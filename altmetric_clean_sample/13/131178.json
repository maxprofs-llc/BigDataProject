The initial steps that govern Bak activation are poorly understood. To further clarify these pivotal events, we have investigated whether post-translational modifications of Bak impinge on its activation potential. In this study, we report that on apoptotic stimulation Bak undergoes dephosphorylation at tyrosine residue 108 (Y108), a critical event that is necessary but not sufficient for Bak activation, but is required both for early exposure of the occluded N-terminal domain and multimerisation. RNA interference (RNAi) screening identified non-receptor tyrosine phosphatases (PTPNs) required for Bak dephosphorylation and apoptotic induction through chemotherapeutic agents. Specifically, modulation of PTPN5 protein expression by siRNA and overexpression directly affected both Bak-Y108 phosphorylation and the initiation of Bak activation. We further show that MEK\/ERK signalling directly affects Bak phosphorylation through inhibition of PTPN5 to promote cell survival. We propose a model of Bak activation in which the regulation of Bak dephosphorylation constitutes the initial step in the activation process, which reveals a previously unsuspected mechanism controlling the initiation of mitochondrial apoptosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027b6","authors":["Joanna L Fox","Ferina Ismail","Abul Azad","Nicola Ternette","Sabrina Leverrier","Mariola J Edelmann","Benedikt M Kessler","Irene M Leigh","Sarah Jackson","Alan Storey"],"doi":"10.1038\/emboj.2010.244","issns":["1460-2075"],"issue":"22","journal":"EMBO Journal","last_mentioned_on":1295222400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20959805"],"pmid":"20959805","pubdate":"2010-11-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"Tyrosine dephosphorylation is required for Bak activation in apoptosis.","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tyrosine-dephosphorylation-required-bak-activation-apoptosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626596,"mean":4.9527436744422,"rank":2018812,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":930718,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626596,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2724675,"mean":5.2351794269724,"rank":1477990,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":737042,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2724675,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3998,"mean":3.2004968726545,"rank":2511,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":537,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3998,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2668,"mean":2.8070026246719,"rank":1309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":428,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2668,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
