Like apoptosis in earlier developmental stages, this unique communal form of cell death is controlled through the apoptosome proteins, Dronc and Dark, together with the IAP antagonists, Reaper, Grim, and Hid. Genetic lesions in these pathways caused intervein epithelial cells to persist, prompting a characteristic late-onset blemishing phenotype throughout the wing blade. We leveraged this phenotype in mosaic animals to discover relevant genes and establish here that homeodomain interacting protein kinase (HIPK) is required for collective death of the wing epithelium. Extra cells also persisted in other tissues, establishing a more generalized requirement for HIPK in the regulation of cell death and cell numbers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002ce3","authors":["Nichole Link","Po Chen","Wan-Jin Lu","Kristi Pogue","Amy Chuong","Miguel Mata","Joshua Checketts","John M Abrams"],"doi":"10.1083\/jcb.200702125","issns":["0021-9525"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1187136000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17682052"],"pmid":"17682052","pubdate":"2007-08-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Rockefeller University Press|1","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"A collective form of cell death requires homeodomain interacting protein kinase.","type":"article","volume":"178","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/collective-form-cell-death-requires-homeodomain-interacting-protein-kinase"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635018,"mean":4.9199431259457,"rank":2017903,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":945542,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635018,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2731429,"mean":5.2114730054857,"rank":1477575,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":749129,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2731429,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4073,"mean":3.2528069744597,"rank":2402,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":475,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4073,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2421,"mean":2.9342462809917,"rank":952,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":313,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2421,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
