The underlying mechanism is largely unknown, but transfer is believed to occur through large-surface interfaces, called virological or infectious synapses. Here, we report the direct visualization of cell-to-cell transmission of retroviruses in living cells. Our results reveal a mechanism of virus transport from infected to non-infected cells, involving thin filopodial bridges. These filopodia originate from non-infected cells and interact, through their tips, with infected cells. A strong association of the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env) in an infected cell with the receptor molecules in a target cell generates a stable bridge. Viruses then move along the outer surface of the filopodial bridge toward the target cell. Our data suggest that retroviruses spread by exploiting an inherent ability of filopodia to transport ligands from cell to cell.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003163","authors":["Nathan M Sherer","Maik J Lehmann","Luisa F Jimenez-Soto","Christina Horensavitz","Marc Pypaert","Walther Mothes"],"doi":"10.1038\/ncb1544","issns":["1465-7392"],"issue":"3","journal":"Nature Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1314040860,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17293854"],"pmid":"17293854","pubdate":"2007-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Retroviruses can establish filopodial bridges for efficient cell-to-cell transmission.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/retroviruses-establish-filopodial-bridges-efficient-celltocell-transmission"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.336,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.336},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3684317,"mean":4.9089888017246,"rank":489837,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":3194353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3684317,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2768741,"mean":5.2497286021825,"rank":403356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":2365263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2768741,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1997,"mean":5.7300320641283,"rank":377,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":1620,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1997,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1992,"mean":5.766408839779,"rank":374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":1618,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1992,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":13,"Researcher":45,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
