We now show that a component of the pathway, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (Uch-L1), is required for normal synaptic and cognitive function. Transduction of Uch-L1 protein fused to the transduction domain of HIV-transactivator protein (TAT) restores normal enzymatic activity and synaptic function both in hippocampal slices treated with oligomeric Abeta and in the APP\/PS1 mouse model of AD. Moreover, intraperitoneal injections with the fusion protein improve the retention of contextual learning in APP\/PS1 mice over time. The beneficial effect of the Uch-L1 fusion protein is associated with restoration of normal levels of the PKA-regulatory subunit IIalpha, PKA activity, and CREB phosphorylation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c1","authors":["Bing Gong","Zixuan Cao","Ping Zheng","Ottavio V Vitolo","Shumin Liu","Agnieszka Staniszewski","Donna Moolman","Hong Zhang","Michael Shelanski","Ottavio Arancio"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cell.2006.06.046","issns":["0092-8674"],"issue":"4","journal":"Cell","last_mentioned_on":1257249997,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16923396","http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0092-8674(06)00963-9"],"pmid":"16923396","pubdate":"2006-08-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Ubiquitin hydrolase Uch-L1 rescues beta-amyloid-induced decreases in synaptic function and contextual memory.","type":"article","volume":"126","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ubiquitin-hydrolase-uchl1-rescues-%CE%B2amyloidinduced-decreases-synaptic-function-contextual-memory"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3636263,"mean":4.9213309833055,"rank":681210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":2931239,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3636263,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2732029,"mean":5.2142496804606,"rank":554659,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":2156237,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2732029,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7728,"mean":10.600584444157,"rank":2161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":5196,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7728,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6217,"mean":9.843241956242,"rank":1791,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":4059,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6217,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":19,"Researcher":39,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
