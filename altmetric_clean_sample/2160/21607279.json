Expressions of miR-107, Dkk-1, LRP5, \u03b2-catenin, and c-Myc were detected by the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. The dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was performed to observe the relationship between miR-107 and Dkk-1.Transfected cells were divided into different investigating groups designated as Inhibitor, Mimic, siRNA, Inhibitor + siRNA, negative control (NC), and blank groups. qRT-PCR and Western blotting were used to detect expressions of miR-107, Dkk-1, \u03b2-catenin, Bcl-2, c-Myc, Caspase-3, and PARP. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), flow cytometry (FCM), colony-formation efficiency (CFE), and subcutaneous tumorigenicity assays were all utilized for to determine cell proliferation, apoptosis, colony-forming, and tumorigenic abilities.\nDkk-1 is the target gene of miR-107. Decreased expressions of miR-107, LRP5, \u03b2-catenin, and c-Myc, and increased expressions of Dkk-1 were found in OS tissues. The Mimic and siRNA groups exhibited decreased proliferation rates, colony-forming abilities, and tumorigenicity and increased apoptosis rates, whereas the inhibitor group showed opposite trends when compared to the blank group. On the other hand, expressions of miR-107, LRP5, \u03b2-catenin, c-Myc, Caspase-3, and PARP were all elevated in the mimic group, whereas expressions of Dkk-1 and Bcl-2 were reduced; opposite trends were observed in the inhibitor group.\nWe conclude that miR-107 is likely to inhibit the occurrence and development of OS by down-regulating Dkk-1 via the Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, providing us with a new therapeutic target for the treatment of OS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b27","authors":["Zhang, Zhi-Cai","Liu, Jian-Xiang","Shao, Zeng-Wu","Pu, Fei-Fei","Wang, Bai-Chuan","Wu, Qiang","Zhang, Yu-Kun","Zeng, Xian-Lin","Guo, Xiao-Dong","Yang, Shu-Hua","He, Tong-Chuan"],"doi":"10.1097\/md.0000000000007245","first_seen_on":"2017-07-07T14:15:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1536-5964"],"issue":"27","journal":"Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1499436935,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28682874?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28682874","pubdate":"2017-07-07T22:01:43+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"In vitro effect of microRNA-107 targeting Dkk-1 by regulation of Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in osteosarcoma.","type":"article","volume":"96","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vitro-effect-microrna107-targeting-dkk1-regulation-wnt%CE%B2catenin-signaling-pathway-osteosarcoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8172783,"mean":6.915960179526,"rank":7072731,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8172783,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176228,"mean":11.486763152071,"rank":142815,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176228,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4073,"mean":2.9615785854617,"rank":3098,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4073,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":183,"mean":1.3126923076923,"rank":110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":183,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
