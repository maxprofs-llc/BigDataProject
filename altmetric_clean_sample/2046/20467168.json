This process is instrumental for the maintenance of Ca(2+) homeostasis. Therefore, all aspects of TRPV5 function are tightly regulated by the calciotropic parathyroid hormone (PTH). Rabbit (rb)TRPV5 channel activity was shown to be stimulated upon PTH-mediated protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation. Since there is incomplete conservation of the PKA consensus motif (RR\/QxT) across species, the aim of this study was to extend these findings to humans and characterize the expression and function of human (h)TRPV5. Functional differences between rbTRPV5 and hTRPV5 upon PTH stimulation were investigated using (45)Ca(2+) uptake assays, Fura-2 Ca(2+) imaging, and cell surface biotinylation. While PTH treatment enhanced rbTRPV5 channel activity, it did not stimulate hTRPV5 activity. Mutation of the human RQxT motif into rabbit RRxT (hTRPV5 Q706R) partially restored the sensitivity to PTH. An ancestral sequence reconstruction of TRPV5 orthologues demonstrated that the change in the RRxT motif coincides with the creation of another putative PKA motif (RGAS to RRAS) in the amino terminus of hTRPV5. Interestingly, a constitutively phosphorylated hTRPV5 mutant (hTRPV5 S141D) displayed significantly decreased channel function, while its plasma membrane abundance was increased. Taken together, PTH-mediated stimulation of TRPV5, via PKA, is not conserved in humans. Our data suggest that PTH regulation of TRPV5 is altered in humans, an important observation for future studies that may add to new concepts on the role of PTH in renal Ca(2+) handling.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032d7","authors":["van Goor, Mark K","Verkaart, Sjoerd","van Dam, Teunis J","Huynen, Martijn A","van der Wijst, Jenny"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00424-017-1996-9","first_seen_on":"2017-05-25T01:13:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1432-2013"],"journal":"Pflugers Archiv European Journal of Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1495620129,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28534087?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28534087","pubdate":"2017-05-25T22:03:58+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Physiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Molecular Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Receptors","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Interspecies differences in PTH-mediated PKA phosphorylation of the epithelial calcium channel TRPV5.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interspecies-differences-pthmediated-pka-phosphorylation-epithelial-calcium-channel-trpv5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8261086,"mean":6.9752528681095,"rank":7144884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8261086,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237559,"mean":12.114855235353,"rank":192646,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237559,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":732,"mean":2.8505253077975,"rank":632,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":732,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":0.95526315789474,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
