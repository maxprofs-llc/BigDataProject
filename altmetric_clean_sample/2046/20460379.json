However the elevated thresholds described may be due to a number of potential mechanisms as current paradigms test not only temporal discrimination but also extraneous sensory and decision-making parameters. In this study two paradigms designed to better quantify temporal processing are presented and a decision-making model is used to assess the influence of decision strategy.\n22 patients with cervical dystonia and 22 age-matched controls completed two tasks (i) temporal resolution (a randomized, automated version of existing TDT paradigms) and (ii) interval discrimination (rating the length of two consecutive intervals).\nIn the temporal resolution task patients had delayed (P\u00a0=\u00a00.021) and more variable (P\u00a0=\u00a00.013) response times but equivalent discrimination thresholds. Modelling these effects suggested this was due to an increased perceptual decision boundary in dystonia with patients requiring greater evidence before committing to decisions (P\u00a0=\u00a00.020). Patient performance on the interval discrimination task was normal.\nOur work suggests that previously observed abnormalities in TDT may not be due to a selective sensory deficit of temporal processing as decision-making itself is abnormal in cervical dystonia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002840","authors":["Sadnicka, A.","Daum, C.","Cordivari, C.","Bhatia, K.
