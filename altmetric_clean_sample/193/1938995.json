In the biomedical field, MALDI-MSI is being more frequently recognized as a new method for the discovery of biomarkers and targets of treatment, classification of diseased and healthy tissues, or prediction of the outcome of a pathology. The technology has been used to study the localization of proteolytic peptides directly on tissue sections. A direct correlation between the detected peptides and the distribution and identity of the original precursor protein is the ultimate goal of any MALDI-MSI experiment. Enzymatic digestion protocols are commonly used to reveal the protein signature of these complex tissues. Considerations that pertain to methods of sample preparation, on-tissue digestion, data analysis, and visualization will be addressed. This review will also discuss selected applications of on-tissue digestion combined with the MALDI-MSI technology in biomedicine.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e0f","authors":["Berta Cillero-Pastor","Ron M.A. Heeren"],"doi":"10.1021\/pr400743a","first_seen_on":"2013-11-27T17:38:29+00:00","issns":["1535-3893","1535-3907"],"journal":"Journal of Proteome Research","last_mentioned_on":1427745362,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/pr400743a","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/pr400743a"],"pmid":"24087847","pubdate":"2013-10-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"131002061804002","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Mass Spectrometry Imaging for Peptide and Protein Analyses: A Critical Review of On-Tissue Digestion","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/matrixassisted-laser-desorption-ionization-mass-spectrometry-imaging-peptide-protein-analyses-critic-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4937419,"mean":5.8572788457487,"rank":1116761,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":3799978,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4937419,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127452,"mean":7.2698306643338,"rank":30917,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":95992,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127452,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2242,"mean":2.9585720660419,"rank":305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":1916,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2242,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148,"mean":2.3546666666667,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
