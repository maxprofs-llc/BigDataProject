In type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance plays a pivotal role in hyperglycaemia. In this study, we tried to fi nd the relation between insulin resistance and carbonyl stress.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9283cf058f61000dd2e","authors":["Pinaki Sarkar","Kaushik Kar","Mohan Chandra Mondal","Indrani Chakraborty","Manoj Kar"],"first_seen_on":"2013-11-27T21:21:36+00:00","issns":["0304-4602"],"issue":"12","journal":"Annals of the Academy of Medicine Singapore","last_mentioned_on":1407605814,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21274487"],"pmid":"21274487","pubdate":"2010-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Elevated level of carbonyl compounds correlates with insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes.","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/elevated-level-carbonyl-compounds-correlates-insulin-resistance-type-2-diabetes-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":2294769,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2718398,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":129146,"mean":7.261083123621,"rank":50546,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":77754,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":129146,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147,"mean":2.0550410958904,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":94,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.125,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Computer Science":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"PT":1,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/renesugar\/status\/405808452770861057","license":"public","citation_ids":[1939446],"posted_on":"2013-11-27T21:20:49+00:00","author":{"name":"Rene Sugar","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/752034702152724480\/AR70UFzp_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"renesugar","tweeter_id":"27602245","geo":{"lt":37.25022,"ln":-119.75126,"country":"US"},"followers":1184},"tweet_id":"405808452770861057"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/johnwhitley\/status\/405811585051947008","license":"public","rt":["renesugar"],"citation_ids":[1939446],"posted_on":"2013-11-27T21:33:16+00:00","author":{"name":"John Whitley","url":"http:\/\/bangpath.org\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/748297413249507329\/ATGARc0v_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"johnwhitley","tweeter_id":"14249456","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":86},"tweet_id":"405811585051947008"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Elevated level of carbonyl compounds ...
