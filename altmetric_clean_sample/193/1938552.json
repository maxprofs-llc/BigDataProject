In 31 patients, a regular laboratory and immunological assessment was made. During clinical benefit, as opposed to progression, a significant increase in the total number of lymphocytes, CD4+, CD8+, NK cells, CRP and IL-12 was confirmed. Also, a significant CEA, TPA, CA15.3 decrease occurred 24-72h after interleukin-2 administration. At the progression, both basally and after interleukin-2 stimulation, the mean values of CD4+ plus CD25+ cells were more than twice higher than during clinical benefit, with a decrease of CD4+ plus CD8+ (Teffector)\/CD4+CD25+ (Treg) ratio. Moreover, a significant increase for CEA and for all 3 markers (standardized values) was found 24-72h after interleukin-2 administration. In patients who survived less than 5years, the Treg cell increase occurred at a significantly shorter time interval than in those who survived longer than 5years (20 vs 45.5months, respectively; P=0.001). These data show laboratory evidence of the effect of immunotherapy as well as that of hormone resistance occuring concomitantly with a laboratory pattern compatible with immune inhibition.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023ec","authors":["Andrea Nicolini","Giuseppe Rossi","Paola Ferrari","Angelo Carpi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.biopha.2013.11.005","first_seen_on":"2013-11-27T14:44:10+00:00","issns":["07533322"],"journal":"Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1416388953,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0753332213001340","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24491318?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24491318","pubdate":"2013-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Masson SAS","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"title":"Clinical and laboratory patterns during immune stimulation in hormone responsive metastatic breast cancer.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-laboratory-patterns-during-immune-stimulation-hormone-responsive-metastatic-breast-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.524,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.524},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":674252,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":4361917,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":129312,"mean":7.2531571328041,"rank":18568,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":110670,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":129312,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320,"mean":2.7450971786834,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":308,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":3.1644,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
