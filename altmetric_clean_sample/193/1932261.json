Chemokines are involved in the growth of many cancers including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, melanoma, lung cancer, gastric cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, colon cancer, non-small lung cancer, non-hodgkin's lymphoma, etc. The expression of chemokines and their receptors is altered in many malignancies and leads to aberrant chemokine receptor signaling. This review focuses on the role of chemokines in key processes that facilitate tumor progression including proliferation, senescence, angiogenesis, epithelial mesenchymal transition, immune evasion and metastasis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Purvaba J Sarvaiya","Donna Guo","Ilya Ulasov","Patrik Gabikian","Maciej S Lesniak","Sarvaiya PJ","Guo D","Ulasov I","Gabikian P","Lesniak MS","Sarvaiya, Purvaba J","Guo, Donna","Ulasov, Ilya","Gabikian, Patrik","Lesniak, Maciej S"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.1426","endpage":"2185","first_seen_on":"2013-11-26T00:12:51+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1949-2553",""],"issue":"12","journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1415935892,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24259307","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24259307?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC3926818","pmid":"24259307","pubdate":"2013-11-09T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"2171","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Chemokines in tumor progression and metastasis.","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chemokines-tumor-progression-metastasis-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4504707,"mean":4.9856818325943,"rank":3076760,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1321768,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4504707,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118936,"mean":6.8926765207888,"rank":80871,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":35754,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118936,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2117,"mean":1.4639470699433,"rank":652,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":1333,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2117,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":1.3029411764706,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
