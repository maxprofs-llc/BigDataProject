Previous studies on the consistent benefits of glycemic control in diabetic nephropathy focused primarily on delaying microalbuminuria. However, this effect on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) remains controversial. This study aims to establish a model that explains the controversial effects of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) on GFR.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f610006982","authors":["Chia-Lin Lee","Tsai-Chung Li","Shih-Yi Lin","Jun-Sing Wang","I-Te Lee","Li-Nien Tseng","Yuh-Min Song","Shang-Feng Tsai","Wayne H-H Sheu"],"doi":"10.1159\/000351803","first_seen_on":"2013-11-27T05:59:33+00:00","issns":["1421-9670","0250-8095"],"issue":"1","journal":"American Journal of Nephrology","last_mentioned_on":1385531939,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23817017"],"pmid":"23817017","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nephrology"],"title":"Dynamic and dual effects of glycated hemoglobin on estimated glomerular filtration rate in type 2 diabetic outpatients.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.karger.com?doi=10.1159\/000351803","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dynamic-dual-effects-glycated-hemoglobin-estimated-glomerular-filtration-rate-type-2-diabetic-outpat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3065349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":943952,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120061,"mean":7.1298382308848,"rank":78539,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":26847,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120061,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":296,"mean":1.8607661016949,"rank":171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":80,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":296,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.7125,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/egfr_news\/status\/405576466449969152","license":"public","citation_ids":[1937190],"posted_on":"2013-11-27T05:58:59+00:00","author":{"name":"egfr_news","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000796310011\/3dccbde55e5e20aaa0d9c47cfcf40ff7_normal.png","id_on_source":"egfr_news","tweeter_id":"2213921569","followers":5},"tweet_id":"405576466449969152"}]}}
