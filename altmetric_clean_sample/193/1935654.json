The unsupported Re NPs convert secondary and benzylic alcohols to ketones and aldehydes, respectively, through catalytic acceptorless dehydrogenation (AD). The oxidant- and acceptor-free neat dehydrogenation of alcohols to obtain dihydrogen gas is a green and atom-economical process for making carbonyl compounds. Secondary aliphatic alcohols give quantitative conversion and yield. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Re K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), and X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data confirmed the characterization of the Re NPs as metallic rhenium with surface oxidation to rhenium(IV) oxide (ReO2). Isotope labeling experiments revealed a novel \u03b3-CH activation mechanism for AD of alcohols.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Yi, Jing","Miller, Jeffrey T.","Zemlyanov, Dmitry Y.","Zhang, Ruihong","Dietrich, Paul J.","Ribeiro, Fabio H.","Suslov, Sergey","Abu\u2010Omar, Mahdi M."],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201307665","endpage":"836","first_seen_on":"2013-11-26T20:55:32+00:00","issns":["1521-3773","1433-7851"],"issue":"3","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
