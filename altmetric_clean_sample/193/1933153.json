Macrovascular alterations are featured by arterial stiffening, disturbed wave reflection and altered central to peripheral pulse pressure amplification. Microvascular alterations, including altered wall-to-lumen ratio of larger arterioles, vasomotor tone abnormalities and network rarefaction, lead to disturbed tissue perfusion and susceptibility to ischemia. Central arterial stiffness and microvascular alterations are common denominators of organ damages. Vascular alterations are intercorrelated, amplifying the haemodynamic load and causing further damage in the arterial network. A plausible precursor role of vascular alterations in incident hypertension provides new insights for preventive and therapeutic strategies targeting macro and microvasculature. Cumulative metabolic burden and oxidative stress lead to chronic endothelial injury, promoting structural and functional vascular alterations, especially in the microvascular network. Pathophysiology of hypertension may then be revisited, based on both macrovascular and microvascular alterations, with a precursor role of endothelial dysfunction for the latter.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a49","doi":"10.1097\/hjh.0000000000000021","first_seen_on":"2013-11-26T03:37:33+00:00","issns":["0263-6352"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Hypertension","last_mentioned_on":1390873255,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jhypertension\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Pathophysiology_of_hypertension___interactions.98692.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jhypertension\/Abstract\/2014\/02000\/Pathophysiology_of_hypertension__interactions.3.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jhypertension\/9000\/00000\/Pathophysiology_of_hypertension___interactions.98692.pdf","pmid":"24270179","pubdate":"2013-11-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"","title":"Pathophysiology of hypertension: interactions between macro and microvascular alterations through endothelial dysfunction","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pathophysiology-hypertension-interactionsbetween-macro-andmicrovascular-alterations-through-endothel"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":3079527,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":959353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118960,"mean":7.1461038340943,"rank":79077,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":26892,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118960,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1756,"mean":1.9685891737892,"rank":938,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":224,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1756,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98,"mean":3.1948865979381,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JHypertension\/status\/404980892197601280","license":"public","citation_ids":[1933153],"posted_on":"2013-11-25T14:32:23+00:00","author":{"name":"J Hypertension","url":"http:\/\/www.jhypertension.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1694937141\/HJH_cover_square_normal.jpg","description":"The Journal contains primary papers from world-renowned experts and authoritative reviews that summarize and evaluate the most significant recent developments.","id_on_source":"JHypertension","tweeter_id":"437628033","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":989},"tweet_id":"404980892197601280"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JHypertension\/status\/427979569862176768","license":"public","citation_ids":[1933153],"posted_on":"2014-01-28T01:40:55+00:00","author":{"name":"J Hypertension","url":"http:\/\/www.jhypertension.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1694937141\/HJH_cover_square_normal.jpg","description":"The Journal contains primary papers from world-renowned experts and authoritative reviews that summarize and evaluate the most significant recent developments.","id_on_source":"JHypertension","tweeter_id":"437628033","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":989},"tweet_id":"427979569862176768"}]}}
