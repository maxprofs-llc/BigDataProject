They reported all signs of disorder they noticed during their walk together with their associated emotional response. Based on recent evidence that odors reflexively direct visual attention to (either semantically or affectively) congruent visual objects, we hypothesized that participants would notice more signs of disorder in the presence of ambient tar odor (since this odor may bias attention to unpleasant and negative features), and less signs of disorder in the presence of ambient grass odor (since this odor may bias visual attention toward the vegetation in the environment and away from the signs of disorder). Contrary to our expectations the results provide no indication that the presence of an ambient odor affected the participants' visual attention for signs of disorder or their emotional response. However, the paradigm used in present study does not allow us to draw any conclusions in this respect. We conclude that a closer affective, semantic, or spatiotemporal link between the contents of a desktop VE and ambient scents may be required to effectively establish diagnostic associations that guide a user's attention. In the absence of these direct links, ambient scent may be more diagnostic for the physical environment of the observer as a whole than for the particular items in that environment (or, in this case, items represented in the VE).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc1b","authors":["Alexander Toet","Martin G. van Schaik"],"doi":"10.3389\/fpsyg.2013.00883","first_seen_on":"2013-11-26T20:55:13+00:00","issns":["1664-1078"],"journal":"Frontiers in Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1385483846,"links":["http:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fpsyg.2013.00883\/abstract?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/DownloadFile\/1\/66235\/68276\/1\/21\/fpsyg-04-00883_pdf","pmid":"24324453","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Visual attention for a desktop virtual environment with ambient scent","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/visual-attention-desktop-virtual-environment-ambient-scent"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6229233,"mean":5.9658211095702,"rank":4606693,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":935322,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6229233,"percentile":15},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":137902,"mean":7.2737031058514,"rank":91351,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":26272,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":137902,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5862,"mean":10.224739805494,"rank":4729,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":580,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5862,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187,"mean":8.7800860215054,"rank":155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
