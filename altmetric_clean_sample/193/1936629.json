To address this, we performed a functional siRNA screen of the human kinome in human mammary epithelial cells that demonstrate a robust AT1R-EGFR transactivation. We identified a suite of genes encoding proteins that both positively and negatively regulate AT1R-EGFR transactivation. Many candidates are components of EGFR signalling networks, whereas others, including TRIO, BMX and CHKA, have not been previously linked to EGFR transactivation. Individual knockdown of TRIO, BMX or CHKA attenuated tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR by angiotensin II stimulation, but this did not occur following direct stimulation of the EGFR with EGF, indicating that these proteins function between the activated AT1R and the EGFR. Further investigation of TRIO and CHKA revealed that their activity is likely to be required for AT1R-EGFR transactivation. CHKA also mediated EGFR transactivation in response to another G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) ligand, thrombin, indicating a pervasive role for CHKA in GPCR-EGFR crosstalk. Our study reveals the power of unbiased, functional genomic screens to identify new signalling mediators important for tissue remodelling in cardiovascular disease and cancer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002ce4","authors":["Amee J George","Brooke W Purdue","Cathryn M Gould","Daniel W Thomas","Yanny Handoko","Hongwei Qian","Gregory A Quaife-Ryan","Kylie A Morgan","Kaylene J Simpson","Walter G Thomas","Ross D Hannan","George AJ","Purdue BW","Gould CM","Thomas DW","Handoko Y","Qian H","Quaife-Ryan GA","Morgan KA","Simpson KJ","Thomas WG","Hannan RD","A.
