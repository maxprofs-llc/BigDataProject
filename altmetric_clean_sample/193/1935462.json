Unlike previous treatments, we simulate all phases of the collision, including the equilibration of the system. For the simulation, we use numerical relativity solutions to anti-de Sitter space\/conformal field theory for the preequilibrium stage, viscous hydrodynamics for the plasma equilibrium stage, and kinetic theory for the low-density hadronic stage. Our preequilibrium stage provides initial conditions for hydrodynamics, resulting in sizable radial flow. The resulting light particle spectra reproduce the measurements from the ALICE experiment at all transverse momenta.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008519","authors":["Wilke van der Schee","Paul Romatschke","Scott Pratt","van der Schee, Wilke","Romatschke, Paul","Pratt, Scott"],"doi":"10.1103\/physrevlett.111.222302","first_seen_on":"2013-11-26T19:28:48+00:00","issns":["0031-9007","1079-7114"],"issue":"22","journal":"Physical Review Letters","last_mentioned_on":1385494079,"links":["http:\/\/prl.aps.org\/abstract\/PRL\/v111\/i22\/e222302"],"pmid":"24329444","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Fully Dynamical Simulation of Central Nuclear Collisions","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.aps.org\/doi\/10.1103\/PhysRevLett.111.222302","volume":"111","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fully-dynamical-simulation-central-nuclear-collisions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5030073,"mean":5.9653562811812,"rank":4187992,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5030073,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128320,"mean":7.2420657112356,"rank":103430,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128320,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13443,"mean":9.3198928730843,"rank":11374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13443,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252,"mean":11.897139442231,"rank":171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
