The number of C\uf8feO and C\uf8ffO functional groups on the surface of rGO might play a major role in controlling the particle size. The strong steric-hindrance effect of C\uf8feO resulted in the growth of large particles, whereas C\uf8ffO contributed to the formation of small particles. The particle size of Ag0.04 @Co0.48 @Ni0.48 NPs supported on rGO with different reduction degrees decreased as the number of C\uf8feO functional groups decreased. The decrease in the particle size probably led to the increase in the catalytic activity towards the hydrolysis of ammonia borane (AB). The enhanced catalytic activity largely stemmed from the increasing active sites on the surface of catalysts owing to the decreasing particle size.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e58","authors":["Qiu, Fangyuan","Li, Li","Liu, Guang","Xu, Changchang","An, Cuihua","Xu, Yanan","Wang, Ying","Huang, Yanan","Chen, Chengcheng","Wang, Yijing","Jiao, Lifang","Yuan, Huatang"],"doi":"10.1002\/asia.201301034","endpage":"493","first_seen_on":"2013-11-25T11:05:05+00:00","issns":["1861-471X","1861-4728"],"issue":"2","journal":"Chemistry - An Asian Journal","last_mentioned_on":1385452548,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201301034\/abstract;jsessionid=7225553414E55D29DB0FF23308DBFE00.f02t02","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/asia.201301034"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201301034\/pdf","pmid":"24273129","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"487","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Synthesis of Size\u2010Controlled Ag@Co@Ni\/Graphene CoreShell Nanoparticles for the Catalytic Hydrolysis of Ammonia Borane","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-sizecontrolled-agconigraphene-coreshell-nanoparticles-catalytic-hydrolysis-ammonia-borane"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6295457,"mean":5.9774125734497,"rank":4425557,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1643729,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6295457,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138327,"mean":7.261264086289,"rank":86127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":46778,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138327,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1380,"mean":1.3047701232777,"rank":260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":1038,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1380,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":0.96785714285714,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
