We used a retrospective chart review and a follow-up telephone interview of snakebite victims who were admitted to a tertiary care center between 1985 and 1994. The data collected included demographics, intent of exposure and host and environmental factors. I performed descriptive analysis. Twenty-four males and six females ranging in age from 2 to 93 years sustained bites from a variety of snakes including rattlesnakes, copperheads, and Egyptian cobra, and others. Sixty-seven percent (20\/30) of all bites resulted from intentional exposures to snakes: professional snake handlers (7), snake hunts (8), and playing with (aggravating) snakes in the wild (5). Sixty-five percent (13\/20) of intentional exposures involved novices in a recreational\/home setting, and 35% (7\/20) occurred in an occupational setting. Unintentional exposures occurred while victims were walking in wooded areas, fishing by streams, gardening, and washing dishes indoors. Forty percent (12\/30) of all victims had consumed alcohol before the snakebite, 92% (11\/12) of whom were nonprofessionals with intentional exposures. Only eight victims (seven of whom were professional handlers) were using protective equipment. I concluded that the majority of snakebite injuries resulted from intentional exposures to snakes in which a variety of factors such as the use of alcohol and lack of protective equipment likely played a role.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f610006798","authors":["Neil Morandi","Janet Williams"],"doi":"10.1580\/1080-6032(1997)008[0152:sicfai]2.3.co;2","endpage":"155","first_seen_on":"2013-11-27T19:00:37+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["10806032"],"issue":"3","journal":"Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (Allen Press Publishing Services Inc.)","last_mentioned_on":1385569200,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S108060329770958X"],"pmid":"11990155","pubdate":"1997-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Commerce, Management, Tourism And Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"152","title":"Snakebite injuries: Contributing factors and intentionality of exposure ","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/snakebite-injuries-contributing-factors-intentionality-exposure"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.44,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.44},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4534060,"mean":5.2893790400115,"rank":715924,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":3817046,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4534060,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120262,"mean":7.2549116006021,"rank":21323,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":98929,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120262,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":318,"mean":4.9527255520505,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":246,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":318,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":6.324,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":{"Medicine":1,"Biological Sciences":10,"Environmental Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":4}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"The Truth About Snakebite","url":"http:\/\/snakesarelong.blogspot.com\/2013\/11\/the-truth-about-snakebite.html","license":"public","citation_ids":[1864778,1939015,1939148,1630770,838988,633586,1939149,1977268,633586,1939151,1939152,783952,1864778,1630770,1939148,838988,1939149,1939152,783952],"posted_on":"2013-11-27T16:20:00+00:00","summary":"Click here to read this article in Spanish!Haga clic aqu&iacute; para leer este art&iacute;culo en espa&ntilde;ol!Many people live in fear of snakes, especially of venomous species that can inflict a lethal bite.
