The relationship between the development of carcinoids and ulcerative colitis has been an unclear and controversial one. The association of ulcerative colitis and the development of ileal-pouch carcinoids has not, however, been well documented. We report a case of carcinoid tumor arising in an ileoanal pouch and discuss its unique diagnostic and therapeutic considerations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9173cf058f61000d1ac","authors":["Murray Resnick","Victor Pricolo","Sonja Chen"],"first_seen_on":"2013-11-27T00:38:24+00:00","issns":["0363-7913"],"issue":"1","journal":"Rhode Island medical journal","last_mentioned_on":1385512672,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23638456"],"pmid":"23638456","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Carcinoid tumor of the ileoanal pouch in a patient with ulcerative colitis.","type":"article","volume":"96","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/carcinoid-tumor-ileoanal-pouch-patient-ulcerative-colitis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3074572,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":952505,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120059,"mean":7.1244114178149,"rank":79552,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":27174,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120059,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":0.9125,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.58333333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Psychology":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/_carcinoid_news\/status\/405495653020610561","license":"public","citation_ids":[1936220],"posted_on":"2013-11-27T00:37:52+00:00","author":{"name":"_carcinoid_news","image":"http:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_0_normal.png","id_on_source":"_carcinoid_news","tweeter_id":"2209654909","followers":6},"tweet_id":"405495653020610561"}]}}
