The enzyme is an important target for the treatment of breast and prostate cancers that proliferate in response to estrogens and androgens. Despite the ample experimental mutagenesis data, the molecular origin and the structural motifs for the enzymatic activities deficiencies have not been rationalized at the atomic resolution. To this end, we have investigated the effects on structural characteristics and tunnel geometry upon single point mutations in CYP17A1. The MD simulation results combined with PMF calculations and MM-GBSA calculations render an \"access mechanism\" which encapsulates the effects of mutations on the changes in both structural flexibility and tunnel dynamics, bridging the gap between the theory and the experimentally observed results of enzymatic activity decrease. The underlying molecular mechanism of the heterogeneities in open\/closed conformational changes, as well as the wider opening of their respective major tunnels between wt17A1 and two mutants, may be attributed to the closer distances of hydrophobic residues or the disruption of a hydrophobic core. The knowledge of ligand binding characteristics and key residues contributions could guide future experimental and computational work on CYPs so that desirable changes in their enzymatic activities may be achieved. The present study provides important insights into the structure-function relationships of CYP17A1 protein, which could contribute to further understanding about 17-hydroxylase deficiencies and may also improve the understanding of polycystic ovary disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5723cf058f610004c74","authors":["Ying-Lu Cui","Qing-Chuan Zheng","Ji-Long Zhang","Qiao Xue","Yan Wang","Hong-Xing Zhang"],"doi":"10.1021\/ci400553w","first_seen_on":"2013-11-26T21:19:50+00:00","issns":["1549-9596","1549-960X"],"journal":"Journal of Chemical Information & Modeling","last_mentioned_on":1385500755,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ci400553w"],"pmid":"24205838","pubdate":"2013-11-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Theoretical And Computational Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Computation Theory And Mathematics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Social Sciences","Physical Sciences","Computer Science"],"startpage":"131118070313005","subjects":["chemistry","medicalinformatics"],"title":"Molecular Dynamic Investigations of the Mutational Effects on Structural Characteristics and Tunnel Geometry in CYP17A1","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-dynamic-investigations-mutational-effects-structural-characteristics-tunnel-geometry-cyp17"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3066823,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":944833,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118963,"mean":7.1489230510585,"rank":78416,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":26744,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118963,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":980,"mean":2.982633299285,"rank":594,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":260,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":980,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":2.9502105263158,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
