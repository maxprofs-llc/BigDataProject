Using 2-deoxy-2-((18)F)fluoro-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG) as the radiopharmaceutical, PET\/CT has demonstrated its efficacy and its utility in the management of patients with advanced melanoma. Nonetheless, challenges remain in the early stage evaluation of melanoma and in the development of novel radiotracers to better characterize lesions found on PET\/CT. This chapter focuses on the advantages and limitations of this imaging modality in melanoma. We also detail and describe the approach to perform (18)F-FDG PET\/CT, the methods to accurately quantify lesions, as well as the pearls\/pitfalls of image interpretation. Finally, an overview of preclinical and investigational clinical radiopharmaceuticals is presented.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd3b","authors":["Khun Visith Keu","Andrei H Iagaru"],"doi":"10.1007\/978-1-62703-727-3_30","first_seen_on":"2013-11-27T00:28:23+00:00","issns":["1940-6029"],"journal":"Methods in molecular biology","last_mentioned_on":1385512087,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24258999"],"pmid":"24258999","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"The Clinical Use of PET\/CT in the Evaluation of Melanoma.","type":"article","volume":"1102","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-petct-evaluation-melanoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628014,"mean":4.9445414826282,"rank":2904821,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75153,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628014,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110684,"mean":6.9738977801471,"rank":86664,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":393,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110684,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2357,"mean":1.4212045840407,"rank":1443,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2357,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":337,"mean":1.0649345238095,"rank":184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":337,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
