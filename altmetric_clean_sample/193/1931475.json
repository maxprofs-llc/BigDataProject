Occasionally, the presence of extra-abdominal disease complicates the ability to obtain a complete surgery, considering some locations of the metastatic disease as unresectable. The objective of the study was to estimate the survival impact of pelvic retroperitoneal invasion and extrapelvic and aortic distant nodal metastases in EOC patients. The anatomical landmarks of primary cytoreductive surgery will be discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100035fa","authors":["Augusto Pereira","Tirso P\u00e9rez-Medina","Javier F Magrina","Paul M Magtibay","Ana Rodr\u00edguez-Tapia","Federico P\u00e9rez-Mil\u00e1n","Lu\u00eds Ortiz-Quintana"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.suronc.2013.10.005","first_seen_on":"2013-11-25T20:35:20+00:00","issns":["1879-3320"],"journal":"Surgical Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1385411429,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24183480"],"pmid":"24183480","pubdate":"2013-10-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms","generalsurgery"],"title":"The impact of pelvic retroperitoneal invasion and distant nodal metastases in epithelial ovarian cancer.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-pelvic-retroperitoneal-invasion-distant-nodal-metastases-epithelial-ovarian-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3563496,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":137648,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118189,"mean":7.1790400209838,"rank":91845,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":841,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118189,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":1.176875,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
