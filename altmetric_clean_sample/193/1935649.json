Especially the high photostability of indigo has been the subject of intensive research. Recently, it was proposed that after photoexcitation an intramolecular proton transfer followed by a nonradiative relaxation to the ground state promote photostability. In indigo the hydrogen bond and the proton transfer occur between the opposing hemiindigo parts. Here, we provide experimental and theoretical evidence that a hydrogen transfer within one hemiindigo or hemithioindigo part is sufficient to attain photostability. This concept can serve as an interesting strategy towards new photostable dyes for the visible part of the spectrum.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Dittmann, Marc","Graupner, Franziska F.","Maerz, Benjamin","Oesterling, Sven","de\u2005Vivie\u2010Riedle, Regina","Zinth, Wolfgang","Engelhard, Martin","L\u00fcttke, Wolfgang"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201307016","endpage":"594","first_seen_on":"2013-11-26T20:54:59+00:00","issns":["1521-3773","1433-7851"],"issue":"2","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
