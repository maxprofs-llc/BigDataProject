Separate production sites became possible with a hypothalamic development, which, interestingly, is triggered by the same transcription factors that underlie the development of various subcortical regions where vasopressin and oxytocin receptors are adjacently expressed and which are connected by inhibitory circuits. The opposite modulation of their output by vasopressin and oxytocin could thus create a dynamic equilibrium for rapid responsiveness to external stimuli. At the level of the individual, nurturing early in life can long-lastingly program oxytocin signaling, maintaining a capability of learning and sensitivity to external stimuli that contributes to development of social behavior in adulthood. Oxytocin and vasopressin are thus important for the development of a vertebrate brain that supports bonding between individuals and building of an interactive community.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022a2","authors":["Stoop, Ron","Hegoburu, Chlo\u00e9","van den Burg, Erwin"],"doi":"10.1146\/annurev-neuro-071714-033904","first_seen_on":"2015-07-11T10:15:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1545-4126","0147-006X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Annual Review of Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1460802246,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26154981?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26154981?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26154981","pubdate":"2015-07-11T22:13:06+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"New Opportunities in Vasopressin and Oxytocin Research: A Perspective from the Amygdala.","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-opportunities-vasopressin-oxytocin-research-perspective-amygdala"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7556298,"mean":6.524637537139,"rank":3349045,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4132790,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7556298,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":224172,"mean":8.1010977958792,"rank":92508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":127281,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":224172,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":354,"mean":8.2672124645892,"rank":296,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":354,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":11.176105263158,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
