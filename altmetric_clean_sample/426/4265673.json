(Oecologia)"],"citation":{"abstract":"Plants, herbivores and parasitoids affect each other directly and indirectly; however, feedback effects mediated by host plant traits have rarely been demonstrated in these tritrophic interactions. Brood-site pollination mutualisms (e.g. those involving figs and fig wasps) represent specialised tritrophic communities where the progeny of mutualistic pollinators and of non-mutualistic gallers (both herbivores) together with that of their parasitoids develop within enclosed inflorescences called syconia (hence termed brood-sites or microcosms). Plant reproductive phenology (which affects temporal brood-site availability) and inflorescence size (representing brood-site size) are plant traits that could affect reproductive resources, and hence relationships between trees, pollinators and non-pollinating wasps. Analysing wasp and seed contents of syconia, we examined direct, indirect, trophic and non-trophic relationships within the interaction web of the fig-fig wasp community of Ficus racemosa in the context of brood site size and availability. We demonstrate that in addition to direct resource competition and predator-prey (host-parasitoid) interactions, these communities display exploitative or apparent competition and trait-mediated indirect interactions. Inflorescence size and plant reproductive phenology impacted plant-herbivore and plant-parasitoid associations. These plant traits also influenced herbivore-herbivore and herbivore-parasitoid relationships via indirect effects. Most importantly, we found a reciprocal effect between within-tree reproductive asynchrony and fig wasp progeny abundances per syconium that drives a positive feedback cycle within the system. The impact of a multitrophic feedback cycle within a community built around a mutualistic core highlights the need for a holistic view of plant-herbivore-parasitoid interactions in the community ecology of mutualisms.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003233","authors":["Krishnan, Anusha","Ghara, Mahua","Kasinathan, Srinivasan","Pramanik, Gautam Kumar","Revadi, Santosh","Borges, Renee M"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00442-015-3372-9","first_seen_on":"2015-07-11T22:15:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-1939"],"journal":"Oecologia","last_mentioned_on":1470377831,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26160003?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00442-015-3372-9"],"pmid":"26160003","pubdate":"2015-07-12T22:01:48+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ecology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Hydrology\/Water Resources","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ecology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Plant reproductive traits mediate tritrophic feedback effects within an obligate brood-site pollination mutualism","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/plant-reproductive-traits-mediate-tritrophic-feedback-effects-within-obligate-broodsite-pollination"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8170298,"mean":6.9145785001388,"rank":3848663,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4139835,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8170298,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227481,"mean":8.3293201248463,"rank":100355,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":118813,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227481,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2404,"mean":4.7053949230129,"rank":1659,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":653,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2404,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":4.3782608695652,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
