This cross-sectional study aims at investigating the relationship between health literacy and three years of medication costs (2009-2011) in a sample of patients with type 2 diabetes.\n391 patients from the German-speaking part of Switzerland who were insured with the same health insurer were interviewed. Health literacy was measured by a validated screening question and interview records were subsequently matched with data on medication costs. A bootstrap regression analysis was applied to investigate the relationship between health literacy and medication costs.\nIn 2010 and 2011 lower levels of health literacy were significantly associated with higher medication costs (p<.05).\nThe results suggest that diabetic patients with lower health literacy will create higher medication costs.\nBesides being sensitive towards patients' health literacy levels, healthcare providers may have to take into account its potential impact on patients' medication regimen, misuse and healthcare costs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032a1","authors":["Mantwill, Sarah","Schulz, Peter J"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pec.2015.07.006","first_seen_on":"2015-07-13T07:46:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0738-3991","1873-5134"],"journal":"Patient Education & Counseling","last_mentioned_on":1438829731,"links":["http:\/\/www.pec-journal.com\/article\/S0738-3991(15)30015-X\/abstract?rss=yes","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S073839911530015X","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26198546?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26198546"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pec-journal.com\/article\/S073839911530015X\/pdf","pmid":"26198546","pubdate":"2015-07-23T11:28:51+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nursing"],"title":"Low health literacy associated with higher medication costs in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: Evidence from matched survey and health insurance data.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/low-health-literacy-associated-higher-medication-costs-patients-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-evidence-ma-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5450695,"mean":6.347149723687,"rank":917651,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":4530025,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5450695,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187702,"mean":8.5601023116554,"rank":40743,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":146816,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187702,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1179,"mean":4.1052716468591,"rank":189,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":989,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1179,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":5.0507462686567,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":55,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
