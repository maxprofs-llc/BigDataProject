Since nanoscopy depends not only on special optics but also on 'smart' photophysical properties of photocontrollable fluorescent probes, including photoactivatability, photoswitchability and repeated blinking, it is important for biologists to understand the advantages and disadvantages of fluorescent probes and to choose appropriate ones for their specific requirements. Here, we summarize the characteristics of currently available fluorescent probes based on both proteins and synthetic compounds applicable to nanoscopy and provide a guideline for selecting optimal probes for specific applications.","authors":["Uno, Shin-Nosuke","Tiwari, Dhermendra K","Kamiya, Mako","Arai, Yoshiyuki","Nagai, Takeharu","Urano, Yasuteru","Shin-nosuke Uno","Dhermendra K.
