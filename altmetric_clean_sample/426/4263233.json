No difference was found in death or BPD at 36\u2005weeks corrected age (adjusted OR 0.88 (95% CI 0.57 to\u00a01.35)). More deaths occurred in infants receiving bilevel NIPPV (9.4%) than in CMV NIPPV (2.3%) (adjusted OR 5.01: 95% CI 1.74 to 14.4). There was a corresponding but not statistically significant decrease in BPD in the bilevel NIPPV group (30% vs 37%) (adjusted OR 0.64 (95% CI 0.41 to 1.02)). No difference was observed in extubation failure or age at last extubation. A post hoc test of interaction between device type and synchronisation was not statistically significant.\nWe did not observe a statistically significant difference in the composite outcome of death or BPD between infants who received mostly bilevel NIPPV compared with mostly CMV NIPPV. Differences in component outcomes of morbidity and BPD may be due to the competing nature of these outcomes or differences in baseline characteristics of infants.\nNCT00433212.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002304","authors":["David Millar","Brigitte Lemyre","Haresh Kirpalani","Aaron Chiu","Bradley A Yoder","Robin S Roberts"],"doi":"10.1136\/archdischild-2014-308123","first_seen_on":"2015-07-11T00:31:51+00:00","funders":["niehs","cihr"],"issns":["1468-2052"],"journal":"Archives of Disease in Childhood -- Fetal & Neonatal Edition","last_mentioned_on":1436686131,"links":["http:\/\/fn.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/07\/10\/archdischild-2014-308123.short?rss=1","http:\/\/fn.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/07\/10\/archdischild-2014-308123.short?g=w_fn_ahead_tab"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/fn.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/07\/10\/archdischild-2014-308123.full.pdf","pmid":"26162889","pubdate":"2015-07-12T07:29:35+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["perinatology","pediatrics"],"title":"A comparison of bilevel and ventilator-delivered non-invasive respiratory support","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-bilevel-ventilatordelivered-noninvasive-respiratory-support"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5342881,"mean":6.2522347045059,"rank":3538403,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1582250,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5342881,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185841,"mean":8.5407521631512,"rank":120597,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":56392,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185841,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":725,"mean":4.6580165745856,"rank":543,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":160,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":725,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":7.9928888888889,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
