Lower eukaryotes play important ecological roles, contributing to nutrient recycling and organic matter mineralization. Yeasts have developed physiological adaptations to optimize their metabolism in low-temperature environments, which affect the rates of biochemical reactions and membrane fluidity. Decreased saturation of fatty acids helps maintain membrane fluidity at low temperatures and the production of compounds that inhibit ice crystallization, such as antifreeze proteins, helps microorganisms survive at temperatures around the freezing point of water. Furthermore, the production of hydrolytic extracellular enzymes active at low temperatures allows consumption of available carbon sources. Beyond their ecological importance, interest in psychrophilic yeasts has increased because of their biotechnological potential and industrial uses. Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids have beneficial effects on human health, and antifreeze proteins are attractive for food industries to maintain texture in food preserved at low temperatures. Furthermore, extracellular cold-active enzymes display unusual substrate specificities with higher catalytic efficiency at low temperatures than their mesophilic counterparts, making them attractive for industrial processes requiring high enzymatic activity at low temperatures. In this minireview, we describe the physiological adaptations of several psychrophilic yeasts and their possible biotechnological applications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f610003740","authors":["Alca\u00edno, Jennifer","Cifuentes, V\u00edctor","Baeza, Marcelo"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11274-015-1900-8","first_seen_on":"2015-07-11T12:27:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-0972"],"journal":"World Journal of Microbiology & Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1436617595,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26160010?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26160010","pubdate":"2015-07-11T22:04:20+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Applied Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Engineering\/Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology","microbiology"],"title":"Physiological adaptations of yeasts living in cold environments and their potential applications.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/physiological-adaptations-yeasts-living-cold-environments-potential-applications"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5339107,"mean":6.2508935716959,"rank":4444493,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5339107,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185798,"mean":8.5398260251782,"rank":149704,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185798,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":418,"mean":1.3835971223022,"rank":249,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":418,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.35,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
