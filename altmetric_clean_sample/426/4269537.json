Headaches are one of the most common and disabling complaints following concussion in the acute phase and are pervasive in those who have prolonged symptoms following concussion. The body of evidence regarding the epidemiology of and risk factors for pediatric concussion and post-traumatic headache is growing rapidly, but there still is a distinct lack of strong scientific evidence to support the best treatment strategies for post-traumatic headaches in either children or adults. In this article, we will review the current evidence regarding the epidemiology of acute and chronic headaches following concussion in the pediatric population, as well as current recommendations for the management of acute and chronic pediatric post-traumatic headaches.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f61000707b","authors":["Blume, Heidi K"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11916-015-0516-x","first_seen_on":"2015-07-13T18:46:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1534-3081"],"issue":"9","journal":"Current Pain and Headache Reports","last_mentioned_on":1436984939,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26163164","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26163164\/"],"pmid":"26163164","pubdate":"2015-07-15T22:07:09+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pain Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"Headaches after Concussion in Pediatrics: a Review.","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/headaches-after-concussion-pediatrics-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5357318,"mean":6.2702967810214,"rank":1975500,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":3355930,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5357318,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185756,"mean":8.5595278404352,"rank":61562,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":122988,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185756,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":374,"mean":3.4207882037534,"rank":141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":230,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":374,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":3.7721,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
