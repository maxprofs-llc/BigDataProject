PVOH grades (DH > 70%) were able to solubilize HCT and CEL up to 15%, but required higher extrusion temperature, due to the crystalline nature of PVOH. The highest drug release rate was observed from hot-melt extruded PVOH samples with a high DH. While drug release from extrudates consisting of PVOH with a low DH was affected by ionic strength, there was no influence of pH and ionic strength on HCT release from PVOH samples with a higher DH. However, PVOH (DH > 70%) required higher extrusion temperatures, which could hamper its application for thermosensitive drugs. Therefore, the secondary purpose was to investigate the effect of sorbitol, a water-soluble plasticizer, on the thermal properties of hot-melt extruded PVOH (DH > 70%). The melting of PVOH\/sorbitol mixture was required to establish molecular interactions between PVOH and sorbitol. These molecular interactions were reflected in the HME behavior: whereas an extrusion temperature of 180\u00b0C was necessary to process physical mixtures of PVOH (DH > 70%) and sorbitol, only 140\u00b0C was necessary during re-extrusion (after quench cooling and cryomilling) of the PVOH\/sorbitol mixture. In addition, the in vitro and in vivo dug release of plasticized PVOH was examined; whereas the CEL\/PVOH\/sorbitol system was able to maintain supersaturation during in vitro dissolution (0.1N HCl) compared to Celebrex(\u00ae), the in vivo pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC0-24h, Cmax and Tmax) were highly comparable.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b89","authors":["Jaeghere, W De","Beer, T De","Bocxlaer, J Van","Remon, J P","Vervaet, C","De Jaeghere, W","De Beer, T","Van Bocxlaer, J","W.
