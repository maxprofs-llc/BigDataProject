While a number of innovative solutions have emerged, multicolor 3D techniques still face significant technical challenges. In this Letter we provide a straightforward approach to single-molecule localization microscopy imaging in three dimensions and two colors. We combine biplane imaging and spectral-demixing, which eliminates a number of problems, including color cross-talk, chromatic aberration effects, and problems with color registration. We present 3D dual-color images of nanoscopic structures in hippocampal neurons with a 3D compound resolution routinely achieved only in a single color.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c89","authors":["Winterflood, Christian M","Platonova, Evgenia","Albrecht, David","Ewers, Helge"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bpj.2015.05.026","first_seen_on":"2015-07-11T22:17:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1542-0086"],"issue":"1","journal":"Biophysical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1436609444,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26153696?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26153696","pubdate":"2015-07-12T22:08:02+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics"],"title":"Dual-Color 3D Superresolution Microscopy by Combined Spectral-Demixing and Biplane Imaging.","type":"article","volume":"109","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dualcolor-3d-superresolution-microscopy-combined-spectraldemixing-biplane-imaging"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5339107,"mean":6.2508935716959,"rank":4444493,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5339107,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185798,"mean":8.5398451320529,"rank":149704,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185798,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2325,"mean":3.5599148020654,"rank":2014,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2325,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93,"mean":2.6150652173913,"rank":77,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
