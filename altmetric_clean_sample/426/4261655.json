Age >85years, gender male, polypharmacy, non use of formal and\/or informal home-help services, history of falls, temporal disorientation, place of living, reasons and nature for ED admission, and use of psychoactive drugs composed the 10 items of BGA and were recorded at the ED admission. The prolonged LHS was defined as the top third of LHS. The ANNs were conducted using two feeds forward (multilayer perceptron [MLP] and modified MLP).\nThe best performance was reported with the modified MLP involving the 10 items (sensitivity=62.7%; specificity=96.6%; PPV=87.1; NPV=87.5; positive LR=18.2; AUC=90.5). In this model, presence of chronic conditions had the highest contributions (51.3%) in AUROC value.\nThe 10-item BGA appears to accurately predict prolonged LHS, using the ANN MLP method, showing the best criteria performance ever reported until now. Presence of chronic conditions was the main contributor for the predictive accuracy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002838","authors":["Launay, C P","Rivi\u00e8re, H","Kabeshova, A","Beauchet, O"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ejim.2015.06.002","first_seen_on":"2015-07-10T11:49:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-0828","0953-6205"],"journal":"European Journal of Internal Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1436544218,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0953620515002071","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26142183?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ejinme.com\/article\/S0953620515002071\/pdf","pmid":"26142183","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["internalmedicine"],"title":"Predicting prolonged length of hospital stay in older emergency department users: Use of a novel analysis method, the Artificial Neural Network.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/predicting-prolonged-length-hospital-stay-older-emergency-department-users-novel-analysis-method-art"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5337025,"mean":6.2508995271515,"rank":2186244,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":3123145,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5337025,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185166,"mean":8.5420615883132,"rank":71981,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":111737,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185166,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":678,"mean":2.4650073855244,"rank":184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":488,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":678,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.96,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
