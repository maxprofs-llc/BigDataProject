Single-crystal X-ray diffraction, together with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, shows that the ferrocene-isocoumarin conjugated compounds display better coplanarity than the corresponding ferrocenylethynyl terephthalates. All the compounds exhibit characteristic MLCT, ICT and \u03c0-\u03c0* transitions in the UV-visible range in solution, and and show higher oscillator strength of the absorption than and , which are verified by time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) theoretical calculations. The electrochemical properties are studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV), which are also in accord with the theoretical calculations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Yedong Peng","Linsen Zhou","Lili Chen","Lu Ma","Yue Zhao","Wen Wei Zhang","Jing-Lin Zuo","Ye-Dong Peng","Lin-Sen Zhou","Li-Li Chen","Wen-Wei Zhang"],"doi":"10.1039\/c5dt02169c","endpage":"14474","first_seen_on":"2015-07-13T10:31:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1477-9234"],"issue":"32","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1436784552,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2015\/DT\/C5DT02169C"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2015\/dt\/c5dt02169c","pmid":"26205806","pubdate":"2015-07-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"14465","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Ferrocene-Isocoumarin Conjugated Molecules: Synthesis, Structural Characterization, Electronic Properties, and DFT-TDDFT Computational Study","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ferroceneisocoumarin-conjugated-molecules-synthesis-structural-characterization-electronic-propertie-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5347664,"mean":6.258017654069,"rank":2441695,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2879583,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5347664,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185614,"mean":8.5571658450649,"rank":83301,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":101070,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185614,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9325,"mean":0.63539360789361,"rank":669,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":8596,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9325,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":498,"mean":0.52414486921529,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":460,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":498,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
