Pediatric neurosurgery has generally been neglected in international surgical initiatives. In Haiti, the poorest country in the Western hemisphere, neurosurgical needs are currently unmet. Project Medishare and Haiti Healthy Kids have treated more than 1400 children with hydrocephalus and congenital disorders for a 10-year period. To develop a sustainable model for improved neurosurgical health, a neurosurgical training program is currently being developed and implemented.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007c24","authors":["Weil, Alexander G","Fallah, Aria","Bhatia, Sanjiv","Ragheb, John","Weil, Alexander G."],"doi":"10.1097\/scs.0000000000001681","first_seen_on":"2015-07-11T20:43:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1536-3732","1049-2275"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Craniofacial Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1461051361,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jcraniofacialsurgery\/Abstract\/2015\/06000\/Pediatric_Neurosurgery_in_the_Developing_World__.18.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jcraniofacialsurgery\/2015\/06000\/Pediatric_Neurosurgery_in_the_Developing_World__.18.pdf","pmid":"26080124","pubdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1061","subjects":["dentistry","generalsurgery"],"title":"Pediatric Neurosurgery in the Developing World: The Haiti Experience","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jcraniofacialsurgery\/Fulltext\/2015\/06000\/Pediatric_Neurosurgery_in_the_Developing_World__.18.aspx","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pediatric-neurosurgery-developing-world"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7571218,"mean":6.5337981331095,"rank":6556922,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7571218,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":224252,"mean":8.1035910921246,"rank":186962,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":224252,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3292,"mean":0.6601774536615,"rank":975,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3292,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173,"mean":0.71453488372093,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Unspecified":6},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":6}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JCSOnline1\/status\/619970045855174656","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4265104],"posted_on":"2015-07-11T20:42:32+00:00","author":{"name":"JCS Online","url":"http:\/\/www.jcraniofacialsurgery.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1397343347\/JCranioSurg_square_normal.jpg","description":"The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery serves as a forum of communication for all those involved in craniofacial and maxillofacial surgery.","id_on_source":"JCSOnline1","tweeter_id":"317871694","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":118},"tweet_id":"619970045855174656"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JCSOnline1\/statuses\/722327879875371009","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4265104],"posted_on":"2016-04-19T07:36:01+00:00","author":{"name":"JCS Online","url":"http:\/\/www.jcraniofacialsurgery.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1397343347\/JCranioSurg_square_normal.jpg","description":"The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery serves as a forum of communication for all those involved in craniofacial and maxillofacial surgery.","id_on_source":"JCSOnline1","tweeter_id":"317871694","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":118},"tweet_id":"722327879875371009"}]}}
