This disease generally exhibits a very poor prognosis. Here we report the case of a 67-year-old man with a sarcomatoid carcinoma in the jejunum, who was hospitalized for diarrhea, fever, nausea, and vomiting. The tumor was located at the jejunum and had a large round shape with geographic necrosis. It involved the entire wall of the small intestine and had directly invaded the neighboring sigmoid colon. Both lobes of the liver had multiple metastases. The patient underwent surgical resection of the jejunum. On immunohistochemical analysis, the tumor was positive for epithelial and mesenchymal markers. The patient died from rapid progression of the liver metastases 6 weeks after the surgery.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8203cf058f61000bc47","authors":["Lee, Hyung Mo","Cho, Min-Sun","Kim, Yong Il"],"doi":"10.5230\/jgc.2015.15.2.143","first_seen_on":"2015-07-11T22:35:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2093-582X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Gastric Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1436623866,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26161289?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4496442","pmid":"26161289","pubdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"A Surgically Resected Large Sarcomatoid Carcinoma of the Jejunum: A Case Report and Literature Review.","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/surgically-resected-large-sarcomatoid-carcinoma-jejunum-case-report-literature-review-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5339107,"mean":6.2508935716959,"rank":4444492,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5339107,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185798,"mean":8.5398260251782,"rank":149703,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185798,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":0.95151515151515,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/status\/619871540117508096","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4265971],"posted_on":"2015-07-11T14:11:06+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":383},"tweet_id":"619871540117508096"}]}}
