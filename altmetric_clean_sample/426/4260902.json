AEoSIs included malignancy (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer), major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), serious infection, and all-cause mortality.<BR \/>\nCumulative rates of AEoSIs\/100 patient-years (PY) are reported for ustekinumab, infliximab, other biologics (mostly adalimumab\/etanercept), and non-biologics based on pre-specified analyses using attribution rules biased against ustekinumab. Risk factors for AEoSIs, including treatments, were determined using multivariate statistical analysis.<BR \/>\nA total of 12,093 patients (40,388 PY) were enrolled in PSOLAR. Overall incidence rates were 0.68\/100PY for malignancy, 0.33\/100PY for MACE, 1.60\/100PY for serious infection, and 0.46\/100PY for mortality. Unadjusted rates of serious infection for infliximab (2.91\/100PY) and other biologics (1.91\/100PY) were numerically higher compared with ustekinumab (0.93\/100PY). Exposure to the combined group of biologics other than ustekinumab was significantly associated with serious infection (hazard ratio=1.96, P<.001). None of the biologics was associated with increased risk of malignancy, MACE, or mortality.<BR \/>\nObservational data have inherent biases.<BR \/>\nAnalysis of 2014 PSOLAR data identified no increased risk of malignancy, MACE, serious infection, or mortality with ustekinumab.<BR \/><BR \/> <EM>J Drugs Dermatol<\/EM>. 2015;14(7):706-714.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa7053cf058f61000a4d4","authors":["Papp, Kim","Gottlieb, Alice B","Naldi, Luigi","Pariser, David","Ho, Vincent","Goyal, Kavitha","Fakharzadeh, Steven","Chevrier, Marc","Calabro, Stephen","Langholff, Wayne","Krueger, Gerald"],"first_seen_on":"2015-07-10T06:38:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1545-9616"],"issue":"7","journal":"Journal of Drugs in Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1476285394,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26151787","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26151787"],"pmid":"26151787","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Safety Surveillance for Ustekinumab and Other Psoriasis Treatments From the Psoriasis Longitudinal Assessment and Registry (PSOLAR).","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/safety-surveillance-ustekinumab-other-psoriasis-treatments-psoriasis-longitudinal-assessment-registr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":15.5,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":15.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7529066,"mean":6.5069445313556,"rank":464875,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7062732,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7529066,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":223504,"mean":8.0945120647152,"rank":19720,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":203730,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":223504,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":515,"mean":2.3993346303502,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":503,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":515,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.3214285714286,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
