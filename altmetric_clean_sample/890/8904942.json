In this mini-review, we recapitulate the initial reports that delineate T-bet and Eomes as master regulators of NK cell development, maturation, and function. We discuss how T-bet and Eomes expression is regulated during NK cell development and peripheral maturation. Furthermore, we summarize the current literature on the role of T-bet and Eomes in the transcriptional regulation of NK cell function and review possible effects of T-box transcription factor anomalies during aging, infection, cancer, and after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. We discuss how the current data argue in favor of a model of T-bet and Eomes synergy in transcriptional regulation of NK cell function and identify T-box transcription factors as potential targets for therapeutic interventions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90c3cf058f61000cb02","authors":["Simonetta, Federico","Pradier, Amandine","Roosnek, Eddy"],"doi":"10.3389\/fimmu.2016.00241","first_seen_on":"2016-06-20T11:12:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1664-3224"],"journal":"Frontiers in immunology","last_mentioned_on":1467811808,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fimmu.2016.00241\/full?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27379101?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27379101?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fimmu.2016.00241\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4913100","pmid":"27379101","pubdate":"2016-06-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"T-bet and Eomesodermin in NK Cell Development, Maturation, and Function","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tbet-eomesodermin-nk-cell-development-maturation-function-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8002013,"mean":6.750266627688,"rank":3619223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4303719,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8002013,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263388,"mean":11.542767927042,"rank":113195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":145685,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263388,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3355,"mean":2.8569230769231,"rank":1279,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":1972,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3355,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123,"mean":2.505262295082,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":59,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
