Recent developments in plant molecular signaling and crosstalk between nutritional, hormonal and environmental stress cues are however revealing a more complex picture of inclusive toxicity. Herbicides induce large-scale metabolic and gene-expression effects that go far beyond the expected consequences of unilinear herbicide-target-damage mechanisms. Moreover, groundbreaking studies have revealed that herbicide action and responses strongly interact with hormone signaling pathways, with numerous regulatory protein-kinases and -phosphatases, with metabolic and circadian clock regulators and with oxidative stress signaling pathways. These interactions are likely to result in mechanisms of adjustment that can determine the level of sensitivity or tolerance to a given herbicide or to a mixture of herbicides depending on the environmental and developmental status of the plant. Such regulations can be described as rheostatic and their importance is discussed in relation with herbicide use strategies, environmental risk assessment and global change assessment challenges.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100034e7","authors":["Alberto, Diana","Serra, Anne-Antonella","Sulmon, C\u00e9cile","Gouesbet, Gwenola","Cou\u00e9e, Ivan"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2016.06.064","endpage":"1628","first_seen_on":"2016-06-20T10:15:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-1026","00489697"],"journal":"Science of the Total Environment","last_mentioned_on":1475500593,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27318518?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0048969716312372"],"pmid":"27318518","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1618","subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Herbicide-related signaling in plants reveals novel insights for herbicide use strategies, environmental risk assessment and global change assessment challenges","type":"article","volume":"569-570","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/herbiciderelated-signaling-plants-reveals-novel-insights-herbicide-strategies-environmental-risk-ass"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7474500,"mean":6.4836868429538,"rank":3301337,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4099854,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7474500,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257556,"mean":11.51518175147,"rank":110765,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":142428,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257556,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4467,"mean":4.7971003134796,"rank":2556,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":1880,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4467,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":215,"mean":6.0849906542056,"rank":100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":215,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
