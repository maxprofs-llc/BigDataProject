We now report inversion effects for isolated facial features: forehead, eyes, nose, mouth, and chin. This shows that configurational information extracted from a whole face (i.e., from spatial relationships among the facial features) is not necessary for obtaining the inversion effects. Other factors, such as \"upright-orientation,\" mental rotation, and feature saliency, account for the inversion effects both in a whole face and in its isolated features. We propose a simple formula that satisfactorily predicts the recognition of a whole face and the inversion effects for that face on the basis of its individual features.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032bf","authors":["Rakover, S S","Teucher, B"],"first_seen_on":"2016-12-02T20:53:41+00:00","issns":["0031-5117"],"issue":"5","journal":"Perception & Psychophysics","last_mentioned_on":1480972910,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9259642"],"pmid":"9259642","pubdate":"1997-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["psychophysiology","psychology"],"title":"Facial inversion effects: parts and whole relationship.","type":"article","volume":"59","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/facial-inversion-effects-parts-whole-relationship"},"altmetric_score":{"score":24.08,"score_history":{"1y":24.08,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":24.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7849747,"mean":6.6509658923939,"rank":323524,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":7526115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7849747,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251614,"mean":12.164110439444,"rank":19219,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":232392,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251614,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":293,"mean":3.8513698630137,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":290,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":293,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
