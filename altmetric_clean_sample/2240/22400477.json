Infants were categorised by presence or absence of hypoxia (SaO(2) <\/= 90%).\nThe respiratory rate was >\/= 50\/min in 120 (60%), >\/= 60\/min in 101 (50. 5%), and >\/= 70\/min in 58 (29%) infants. Hypoxia (SaO(2) <\/= 90%) was seen in 77 (38.5%) infants. Respiratory rate and SaO(2) showed a significant negative correlation (r = -0.39). Respiratory rate >\/= 60\/min predicted hypoxia with 80% sensitivity and 68% specificity.\nThese results indicates that a respiratory rate > 60\/min is a good predictor of hypoxia in infants under 2 months of age brought to the emergency service of an urban hospital for any symptom(s) of acute illness.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002302","authors":["V T Rajesh","Sunit Singhi","Sudha
