Among 42,110 inborn infants, 757 male (3.54%) and 326 female (1.57%) newborns were G6PD-deficient. Compared to the occurrence of hyperbilirubinemia in G6PD-normal newborns (1.41% in male, 1.44% in female) in the well-baby nursery, a significantly higher incidence was observed in both G6PD-deficient male (11.36%) and female (7.06%) newborns. Further analyses demonstrated that the enzyme activity of G6PD in G6PD-deficient male newborns with hyperbilirubinemia (1.56+\/-1.37 U\/g Hb) were significantly lower than the subjects without hyperbilirubinemia (2.01+\/-1.7 U\/g Hb). No significant difference was observed in G6PD-deficient female newborns with hyperbilirubinemia (6.91+\/-2.76 U\/g Hb) compared to those without hyperbilirubinemia (7.81+\/-2.84 U\/g Hb). These data suggest that the G6PD-deficient neonates are at increased risk for hyperbilirubinemia even in the nursery free from agents that can potentially cause hemolysis to G6PD-deficient red cells. The lower G6PD enzyme activity was associated with the neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in G6PD-deficient male neonates.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002742","authors":["Yi-Hao Weng","Yi-Hung Chou","Rey-In Lien"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0378-3782(03)00002-1","first_seen_on":"2017-07-26T04:02:40+00:00","issns":["03783782"],"issue":"2","journal":"Early Human Development","last_mentioned_on":1325376000,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0378-3782(03)00002-1"],"pmid":"12663150","pubdate":"2003-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["embryology","perinatology","pediatrics"],"title":"Hyperbilirubinemia in healthy neonates with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency","type":"article","volume":"71","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hyperbilirubinemia-healthy-neonates-glucose6phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8087762,"mean":6.89417901097,"rank":2038621,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4955748,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8087762,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96817,"mean":10.91619271608,"rank":29989,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":65821,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96817,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":744,"mean":3.9571467025572,"rank":161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":744,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":3.6472222222222,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
