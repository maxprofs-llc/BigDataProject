In addition, microbiologic cultures and physicochemical parameters were measured. The systems were sampled over an 18-month period (1997-1999), resulting in a total of 212 samples for the different analyses.\nTwenty-one percent of the samples (16\/77) were positive for H. pylori; of these, 42% (5\/12) were confirmed for cagA gene detection by PCR hybridization. Microbiologic samples (n = 74) yielded Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas caviae, Aeromonas veronii, and Vibrio fluvialis. In the samples for physicochemical analyses (n = 61), low concentrations of dissolved oxygen were detected and residual chlorine was less than the inactivation dose, both providing conditions for potential survival of H. pylori and other enteric pathogens in these environments.\nThe results of this study suggest that, in Mexico City, water used for human consumption and irrigation may play an important role as a vehicle in the transmission of H. pylori as well as infection by other known enteric pathogens.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002308","authors":["Marisa Mazari-Hiriart","Yolanda L\u00f3pez-Vidal","Gonzalo Castillo-Rojas","Sergio Ponce de Le\u00f3n","Alejandro Cravioto"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0188-4409(01)00304-6","first_seen_on":"2017-07-26T03:54:45+00:00","issns":["01884409"],"issue":"5","journal":"Archives of Medical Research","last_mentioned_on":1041379200,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0188-4409(01)00304-6"],"pmid":"11578764","pubdate":"2001-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Helicobacter pylori and Other Enteric Bacteria in Freshwater Environments in Mexico City","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/helicobacter-pylori-other-enteric-bacteria-freshwater-environments-mexico-city"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8087762,"mean":6.89417901097,"rank":2038421,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4955799,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8087762,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96815,"mean":10.91614760262,"rank":29987,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":65821,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96815,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":301,"mean":3.4758266666667,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":183,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":301,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Design":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}}},"posts":{"policy":[{"title":"Health risks in aquifer recharge using reclaimed water: state of the art report \/edited by R.
