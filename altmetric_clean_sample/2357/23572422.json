All instances of arthroscopic Bankart repair from 2005 to 2014 from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program prospective database were analyzed. Both univariate analysis and binary logistic regression were performed to determine risk factors for admission following surgery. Of 2291 patients undergoing arthroscopic Bankart repair, 173 (7.6%) required inpatient hospital admission following surgery. Univariate analysis found the following to be associated with admission: female sex (P=.009), age older than 40 years (P<.001), white race (P=.002), body mass index greater than 30 kg\/m(2) (P=.001), and American Society of Anesthesiologists class greater than 3 (P<.001). Independent predictors of admission on multivariate analysis included female sex (odds ratio [OR], 1.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-2.10; P=.023), increasing age (per year) (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.04; P<.001), diabetes (OR, 2.70; 95% CI, 2.30-3.10; P=.006), and longer operation time (per minute) (OR, 1.010; 95% CI, 1.009-1.011; P<.001). This study identified a 7.6% rate of admission following arthroscopic Bankart repair, with diabetes, female sex, increasing age, and longer operation time being independent risk factors for admission. Knowledge of these risk factors is important when setting patient expectations preoperatively and for optimizing care to obtain the best short-term outcome.
