The eligible patients were at or above 50\u00a0years of age, and the outcomes of the typical elderly patients (\u226560\u00a0years) were analyzed individually.\nThe pooled estimates (95% confidence interval (CI)) for 1-year OS, EFS and NRM were 65 (55-74) \u00a0%, 50 (44-55) \u00a0% and 26 (21-30) \u00a0%, respectively; as for the patients\u00a0\u226560\u00a0years of age, these were 63 (53-72) %, 46 (41-50) \u00a0% and 28 (23-32) %, respectively. No significantly statistical difference achieved between MDS and AML patients in 1-year EFS and NRM [relative risk (RR) 0.91, 95% CI 0.80-1.04; P\u00a0=\u00a00.172 and RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.82-1.69; P\u00a0=\u00a00.365]. The patients with lower diseases risk had the possibility of higher OS rate at\u00a0\u2265\u00a03\u00a0years than those with higher diseases risk (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.95-1.97; P\u00a0=\u00a00.088). The patients had significantly higher 2-year OS and EFS rates in complete remission (CR, CR1 and CR2) at transplantation compared to those with advanced diseases (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).\nRIC-alloHSCT is a feasible treatment option for the patients older than 50\u00a0year of age with MDS and AML. Advanced diseases status and higher diseases risk may be the poor factors for prognosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cda","authors":["Zhi-hui Zhang","Xin-yue Lian","Dong-ming Yao","Pin-fang He","Ji-chun Ma","Zi-jun Xu","Hong Guo","Wei Zhang","Jiang Lin","Jun Qian"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00432-017-2429-z","first_seen_on":"2017-05-05T10:01:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0171-5216","1432-1335"],"journal":"Journal of Cancer Research & Clinical Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1493978440,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28470473?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28470473","pubdate":"2017-05-05T22:06:26+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Hematology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Reduced intensity conditioning of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia in patients older than 50\u00a0years of age: a systematic review and meta-analysis","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8160820,"mean":6.9113685834654,"rank":7063041,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8160820,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236493,"mean":12.551208903472,"rank":192288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236493,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":623,"mean":2.4431221864952,"rank":468,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":623,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":0.81583333333333,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/860434060220416000","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19869870],"posted_on":"2017-05-05T10:00:40+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":714},"tweet_id":"860434060220416000"}]}}
