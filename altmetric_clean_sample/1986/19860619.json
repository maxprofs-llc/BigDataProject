ANIMALS 8 healthy adult horses. PROCEDURES A 2.5 \u00d7 2.5-cm, full-thickness, cutaneous wound was created at the dorsal aspect of each metacarpus and metatarsus (1 wound\/limb\/horse), covered with nonadhesive dressing, and bandaged. Wounds were inoculated with bacteria and fungi the next day. Each wound on a given horse was randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups (SSC, TAO, HNE, or no topical treatment [control]). Bandage changes, culture of wound samples, treatments, photography for wound measurements, and biopsy were performed at predetermined time points. Time (days) until wound closure, number of EGT excisions, microbial counts, and scores for selected histologic characteristics were compared among groups. RESULTS Median time to wound closure for all groups was 42 days. Time to wound closure and histologic characteristics of wound healing did not differ among groups. Least squares mean microbial counts were significantly higher for HNE-treated wounds on days 9 and 21, compared with SSC-treated and TAO-treated wounds, but not controls. Proportions of SSC-treated (7\/8) or HNE-treated (5\/8) wounds needing EGT excision were significantly greater than that of TAO-treated (1\/8) wounds. The proportion of SSC-treated wounds with EGT excision was greater than that of controls (3\/8). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE None of the treatments resulted in more rapid wound closure, compared with that for untreated control wounds under the study conditions. When treatment is warranted, TAO may help to limit EGT formation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002221","authors":["Caroline C. Gillespie Harmon","Jan F.
