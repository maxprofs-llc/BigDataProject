Its drawbacks include increased bleeding risk and low recanalization rates. Mechanical thrombectomy is a new promising therapy option. Devices used for this procedure were substantially improved during recent years. New devices require extensive preclinical invivo testing. We therefore sought to translate the commonly used pig model to a simplified and cheaper rabbit model.\nWe performed thromboembolisation in eight intubated and sedated adult female New Zealand white rabbits. The thrombus was created by careful rotation of autologous blood in a silicone tube and addition of barium sulfate for radiopacity. We injected the artificial thrombus via a catheter through the cannulated femoral artery. After thromboembolisation, 2D-DSA was performed to evaluate location and thrombus dimensions.\nNone.\nNo complications or mortality were observed in our series. In seven cases (87.5%) the location of the thromboembolism was the maxillary artery and in one case (12.5%) the thrombus reached the occipital artery. The radiopaque thrombus had a length of 7.0\u00b14.55mm invivo. Vessel diameters in angiographic evaluation were 2.44\u00b10.21mm for the common carotid artery and 2.1\u00b10.16mm for the maxillary artery.\nThe novel small animal model for mechanical thrombectomy in rabbit is technically feasible and cheap. It offers comparable vessel diameters to cranial arteries and closely mimics human coagulation system.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e7a","authors":["T. Haider","R. Plasenzotti","H.
