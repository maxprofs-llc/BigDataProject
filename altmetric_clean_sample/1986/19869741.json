Natural bone has an ordered composition of organic fibers with dispersion of inorganic apatite among them. In this study, poly (lactic acid) (PLA) mats were fabricated with electrospinning and coated with chitosan (CH)\/calcium silicate (CS) mixer. The microstructure, chemical component, and contact angle of CS\/CH-PLA composites were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. In vitro, various CS\/CH-coated PLA mats increased the formation of hydroxyapatite on the specimens' surface when soaked in cell cultured medium. During culture, several biological characteristics of the human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) cultured on CS\/CH-PLA groups were promoted as compared to those on pure PLA mat. Increased secretion levels of Collagen I and fibronectin were observed in calcium silicate-powder content. Furthermore, with comparison to PLA mats without CS\/CH, CS10 and CS15 mats markedly enhanced the proliferation of hMSCs and their osteogenesis properties, which was characterized by osteogenic-related gene expression. These results clearly demonstrated that the biodegradable and electroactive CS\/CH-PLA composite mats are an ideal and suitable candidate for bone tissue engineering.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f6100041bc","authors":["Chu-Jung Su","Ming-Gene Tu","Li-Ju Wei","Tuan-Ti Hsu","Chia-Tze Kao","Tsui-Han Chen","Tsui-Hsien Huang"],"doi":"10.3390\/ma10050501","first_seen_on":"2017-05-05T09:55:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1996-1944"],"issue":"5","journal":"Materials (1996-1944)","last_mentioned_on":1502113158,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1996-1944\/10\/5\/501?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1996-1944\/10\/5\/501","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28772861"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1996-1944\/10\/5\/501\/pdf","pmid":"28772861","pubdate":"2017-05-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Calcium Silicate\/Chitosan-Coated Electrospun Poly (Lactic Acid) Fibers for Bone Tissue Engineering","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/calcium-silicatechitosancoated-electrospun-poly-lactic-acid-fibers-bone-tissue-engineering-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336644,"mean":7.0294968595789,"rank":4200042,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3922697,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336644,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246286,"mean":12.594022965264,"rank":124440,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":111460,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246286,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1190,"mean":0.96334230445753,"rank":195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":968,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1190,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268,"mean":0.75861423220974,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":221,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/P_Doggy_Bone\/statuses\/860432602976497664","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19869741],"posted_on":"2017-05-05T09:54:53+00:00","author":{"name":"Precious Daniel\u2122","url":"http:\/\/facebook.com\/precious.ogunleye","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/913708571468210177\/oIecAg-R_normal.jpg","description":"All I want is to be RICH and FAMOUS through God's blessings.
