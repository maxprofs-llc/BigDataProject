A total of 199 Hispanic, Korean and Russian participants were interviewed either in their own native language without an interpreter, or through an interpreter. Interviewees either lied or told the truth about a trip they made during the last twelve months. Half of the participants listened to a MS at the beginning of the interview. The dependent variables were 'detail', 'complications', 'common knowledge details', 'self-handicapping strategies' and 'ratio of complications'. In the MS-absent condition, the interviews resulted in less detail when an interpreter was present than when an interpreter was absent. In the MS-present condition, the interviews resulted in a similar amount of detail in the interpreter present and absent conditions. Truthful statements included more complications and fewer common knowledge details and self-handicapping strategies than deceptive statements, and the ratio of complications was higher for truth tellers than liars. The MS strengthened these results, whereas an interpreter had no effect on these results.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002165","authors":["Aldert Vrij","Sharon Leal","Samantha Mann","Gary Dalton","Eunkyung Jo","Alla Shaboltas","Maria Khaleeva","Juliana Granskaya","Kate Houston"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.actpsy.2017.04.011","first_seen_on":"2017-05-05T06:43:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["00016918","1873-6297"],"journal":"Acta Psychologica","last_mentioned_on":1493966568,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0001691816301998","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.actpsy.2017.04.011"],"pmid":"28477454","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Using the model statement to elicit information and cues to deceit in interpreter-based interviews","type":"article","volume":"177","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/using-model-statement-elicit-information-cues-deceit-interpreterbased-interviews"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8160820,"mean":6.9113685834654,"rank":7063036,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8160820,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236493,"mean":12.55125287959,"rank":192290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236493,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":690,"mean":6.5324905660377,"rank":600,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":690,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":3.7065789473684,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
