Curtailing expression of CAR through modification of T cells by in vitro-transcribed mRNA species is one strategy to mitigate such toxicity. We evaluated expression of an EGFR-specific CAR coded from introduced mRNA in human T cells numerically expanded ex vivo to clinically significant numbers through coculture with activating and propagating cells (AaPC) derived from K562 preloaded with anti-CD3 antibody. The density of AaPC could be adjusted to affect phenotype of T cells such that reduced ratio of AaPC resulted in higher proportion of CD8 and central memory T cells that were more conducive to electrotransfer of mRNA than T cells expanded with high ratios of AaPC. RNA-modified CAR T cells produced less cytokine, but demonstrated similar cytolytic capacity as DNA-modified CAR T cells in response to EGFR-expressing glioblastoma cells. Expression of CAR by mRNA transfer was transient and accelerated by stimulation with cytokine and antigen. Loss of CAR abrogated T-cell function in response to tumor and normal cells expressing EGFR. We describe a clinically applicable method to propagate and modify T cells to transiently express EGFR-specific CAR to target EGFR-expressing tumor cells that may be used to limit on-target, off-tissue toxicity to normal tissue.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cc8","authors":["Caruso, Hillary G","Torikai, Hiroki","Zhang, Ling","Maiti, Sourindra","Dai, Jianliang","Do, Kim-Anh","Singh, Harjeet","Huls, Helen","Lee, Dean A","Champlin, Richard E","Heimberger, Amy B","Cooper, Laurence J N","Caruso, Hillary G.","Lee, Dean A.","Champlin, Richard E.","Heimberger, Amy B.","Cooper, Laurence J.N.","Hillary G.
