The manifestations of this syndrome range from asymptomatic elevation of serum muscle enzymes to life-threatening cases associated with extremely high enzyme levels, electrolyte imbalance, and acute renal failure. Symptoms of rhabdomyolysis include dark urine, muscle weakness, and fatigue. Statins are commonly used drugs for the prevention and management of dyslipidemia. We present an interesting and critical case on statin-induced rhabdomyolysis with renal failure and previously undiagnosed idiopathic hypothyroidism.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002aa9","authors":["Ambapkar","Sachinkumar N Ambapkar","Naresh Shetty","Arpita Dwivedy","Harshad Onkarrao Malve"],"doi":"10.4103\/0972-5229.182210","first_seen_on":"2016-05-11T09:19:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0972-5229"],"issue":"5","journal":"Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1462958378,"links":["http:\/\/www.ijccm.org\/article.asp?issn=0972-5229;year%3D2016;volume%3D20;issue%3D5;spage%3D305;epage%3D307;aulast%3DAmbapkar#.VzL5Ibpi2HY.twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ijccm.org\/article.asp?issn=0972-5229;year=2016;volume=20;issue=5;spage=305;epage=307;aulast=Ambapkar;type=2","pmcid":"PMC4876655","pmid":"27275082","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medknow Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"305","title":"Statin-induced rhabdomyolysis in patient with renal failure and underlying undiagnosed hypothyroidism","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/statininduced-rhabdomyolysis-patient-renal-failure-underlying-undiagnosed-hypothyroidism"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7684314,"mean":6.5948576928038,"rank":3979391,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2159044,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7684314,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267934,"mean":11.424858027939,"rank":145556,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":96144,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267934,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246,"mean":2.7495755102041,"rank":96,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":126,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.7153846153846,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
