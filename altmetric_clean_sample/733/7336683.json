Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate the role of obesity and RYGB on the human skeletal muscle proteome. Basal muscle biopsies were obtained from seven obese (BMI >40 kg\/m2) female subjects (45.1\u00b13.6 years) pre and 3 months post-RYGB, and euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps were used to assess insulin sensitivity. Four age-matched (48.5\u00b14.7 years) lean (BMI <25 kg\/m2) females served as controls. We performed quantitative mass spectrometry and microarray analyses on protein and RNA isolated from the muscle biopsies. Significant improvements in FPG (104.2\u00b17.8 vs. 86.7\u00b13.1 mg\/dl) and BMI (42.1\u00b12.2 vs. 35.3\u00b11.8 kg\/m(2)) were demonstrated in the pre vs. post-RYGB, both P<0.05. Proteomic analysis identified 2,877 quantifiable proteins. Of these, 395 proteins were significantly altered in obesity before surgery, and 280 proteins differed significantly post-RYGB. Post-RYGB, 49 proteins were returned to normal levels after surgery. KEGG pathway analysis revealed a decreased abundance in ribosomal and oxidative phosphorylation proteins in obesity, and a normalization of ribosomal proteins post-RYGB. The transcriptomic data confirmed the normalization of the ribosomal proteins. Our results provide evidence that obesity and RYGB have a dynamic effect on the skeletal muscle proteome.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026f7","authors":["Latoya E. Campbell","Paul R.
