We show that the first-order transition from the stripe state to the paramagnet can be split, giving rise to an intermediate nematic phase in which algebraic correlations coexist with a broken symmetry. Furthermore, we demonstrate the emergence of several properties of a more topological nature such as fractional edge excitations in the stripe state, the proliferation of double domain walls in the nematic phase, and the Kasteleyn transition between them. Experimental implications are briefly discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008519","authors":["Andrew Smerald","Sergey Korshunov","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mila"],"doi":"10.1103\/physrevlett.116.197201","first_seen_on":"2016-05-11T02:57:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0031-9007","1079-7114"],"issue":"19","journal":"Physical Review Letters","last_mentioned_on":1462935433,"links":["http:\/\/journals.aps.org\/prl\/abstract\/10.1103\/PhysRevLett.116.197201"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.aps.org\/pdf\/10.1103\/PhysRevLett.116.197201","pmid":"27232039","pubdate":"2016-05-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Physical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Topological Aspects of Symmetry Breaking in Triangular-Lattice Ising Antiferromagnets","type":"article","volume":"116","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/topological-aspects-symmetry-breaking-triangularlattice-ising-antiferromagnets"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7684314,"mean":6.5948576928038,"rank":6648324,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7684314,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267934,"mean":11.424895350703,"rank":223863,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267934,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15656,"mean":10.75855483871,"rank":12990,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15656,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":356,"mean":27.640974647887,"rank":298,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":356,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
