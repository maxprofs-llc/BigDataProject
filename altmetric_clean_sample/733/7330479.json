When the molecular mechanics MM4 force field was developed beginning in the early 1990s, C-C bond lengths were not known very reliably for many important molecules, and bond lengths greater than 1.6 \u00c5 were quite poorly known experimentally. Quantum-mechanically computed values could not yet be obtained with useful accuracy in a general way. This paper examines structures now available from experiment and quantum-mechanical computations and extends the fit of the MM4 methodology to include new bond distances as long as 1.71 \u00c5.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bcd","authors":["Norman L.
