ApoA-I-Milano (M) is a mutated variant, which showed increased vasoprotective properties compared to ApoA-I-wild type in models of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular damage. We speculated that ApoA-I-M may also protect A\u03b2-affected vasculature and reverse some of the pathological features associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). For this purpose, we produced and characterized human recombinant ApoA-I-wild type and ApoA-I-M proteins. Both of them were able to avoid the aggregation of A\u03b2 in\u00a0vitro, even though recombinant ApoA-I-M was significantly more effective in protecting endothelial cells from A\u03b2(1-42)-toxicity. Next, we determined the effect of chronic intravenous administration of rApoA-I-M in the APP23-transgenic mouse model of AD. We found reduced cerebral A\u03b2 levels in mice that received rApoA-I-M, which were accompanied by a lower expression of astrocyte and microglia neuroinflammatory markers. Our results suggest an applicability of this molecule as a therapeutic candidate for protecting the brain in AD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f61000318e","authors":["Fern\u00e1ndez-de Retana, Sof\u00eda","Monta\u00f1ola, Alex","Marazuela, Paula","De La Cuesta, Maialen","Batlle, Aina","Fatar, Marc","Grudzenski, Saskia","Montaner, Joan","Hern\u00e1ndez-Guillamon, Mar","Sof\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez-de Retana","Alex Monta\u00f1ola","Paula Marazuela","Maialen De La Cuesta","Aina Batlle","Marc Fatar","Saskia Grudzenski","Joan Montaner","Mar Hern\u00e1ndez-Guillamon"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neurobiolaging.2017.08.028","first_seen_on":"2017-09-05T09:08:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0197-4580","01974580","1558-1497"],"journal":"Neurobiology of Aging","last_mentioned_on":1506340872,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0197458017302841","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?cmd=Search&term=(((Alzheimers+Disease)+AND+%222017%2F09%2F25+06.00%22%5BMHDA%5D%3A%222017%2F09%2F25+08.00%22%5BMHDA%5D))+NOT+((+(((%22alzheimer+disease%22%5BTIAB%5D+OR+(%22alzheimer%22%5BTIAB%5D+AND+%22disease%22%5BTIAB%5D)+OR+%22alzheimer+disease%22%5BTIAB%5D+OR+(%22alzheimers%22%5BTIAB%5D+AND+%22disease%22%5BTIAB%5D)+OR+%22alzheimers+disease%22%5BTIAB%5D)))+AND+%220001%22%5BEDAT%5D%3A%222017%2F09%2F25+06.00%22%5BEDAT%5D))&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+PubmedNeurobrain+(Pubmed%3A+Neurobrain)"],"pmid":"28941727","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology","geriatrics","neurology"],"title":"Intravenous treatment with human recombinant ApoA-I Milano reduces \u03b2-amyloid cerebral deposition in the APP23-transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer\u2019s disease","type":"article","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intravenous-treatment-human-recombinant-apoai-milano-reduces-%CE%B2amyloid-cerebral-deposition-app23trans"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0.75,"1m":0.75,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8461697,"mean":7.1088157534769,"rank":6116470,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2041514,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8461697,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167296,"mean":12.181670725365,"rank":108108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":49216,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167296,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2029,"mean":8.2625098619329,"rank":1679,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":312,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2029,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":14.175533333333,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BibliotecaHUVH\/statuses\/904994512346517504","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24792490],"posted_on":"2017-09-05T09:08:00+00:00","author":{"name":"BibliotecaHUVH.
