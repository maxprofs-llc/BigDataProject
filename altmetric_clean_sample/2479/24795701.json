A seminal paper of a mathematical model of speciation was published by Orr (1995), extended by Livingstone et\u00a0al. (2012) to incorporate interaction networks. Here, we further develop the model to take into account the possibility of different substitution rates for network nodes of different connectivity. Mathematically, this amounts to sampling nodes from an undirected graph where the inclusion probability for a given node depends on its degree (number of connecting edges). We establish formulas for the rate of speciation and identify a crucial parameter that is a measure of the deviation from simple random sampling.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5013cf058f610003067","authors":["Peter Olofsson","Kevin Livingstone","Joshua Humphreys","Douglas Steinman"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.mbs.2016.04.010","first_seen_on":"2017-09-05T10:11:22+00:00","issns":["00255564"],"journal":"Mathematical Biosciences","last_mentioned_on":1504615244,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27177943?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27177943","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Mathematics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Medicine","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["statisticsastopic"],"title":"The probability of speciation on an interaction network with unequal substitution rates","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":2.35,"6m":2.35,"3m":2.35,"1m":2.35,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366342,"mean":7.0541652571821,"rank":3483257,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4837607,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366342,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117791,"mean":12.053176942016,"rank":41604,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":75145,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117791,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":403,"mean":1.9822686567164,"rank":141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":262,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":403,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.58333333333333,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"CO":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/bionet_papers\/statuses\/905010396876070912","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24795701],"posted_on":"2017-09-05T10:11:07+00:00","author":{"name":"BioNetPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/848204009055948801\/lkerJJYd_normal.jpg","description":"A feed for papers in network biology.","id_on_source":"bionet_papers","tweeter_id":"2384073290","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":74},"tweet_id":"905010396876070912"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/speciation_pubs\/statuses\/905015931138580481","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24795701],"posted_on":"2017-09-05T10:33:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Speciation Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/523698250742644736\/gdXvh9Mn_normal.jpeg","description":"Bot aggregating papers and pre-prints dealing with the process of speciation.
