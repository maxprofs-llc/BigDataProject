Immune cells involved in both innate and adaptive immune responses regulate the progress of muscle regeneration. In this review, we discussed the roles of different immune cells in muscle regeneration. The immune cells regulate muscle regeneration through cytokine production, cell-cell contacts, and general immune environment regulation. We also describe the current known mechanism of how immune cells regulating muscle regeneration.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c9","authors":["Wenjun Yang","Ping Hu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cellimm.2017.08.006","first_seen_on":"2017-09-05T11:11:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["00088749","1090-2163"],"journal":"Cellular Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1504995363,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28867121?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28867121"],"pmid":"28867121","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Hierarchical signaling transduction of the immune and muscle cell crosstalk in muscle regeneration","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hierarchical-signaling-transduction-immune-muscle-cell-crosstalk-muscle-regeneration"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.75,"6m":1.75,"3m":1.75,"1m":1.75,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8389558,"mean":7.0669301492244,"rank":3863352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4442209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8389558,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128316,"mean":12.071505716401,"rank":54105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":72105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128316,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":550,"mean":2.1657413479053,"rank":214,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":328,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":550,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.70833333333333,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MuscleStemCell\/statuses\/905025485930766340","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24798671],"posted_on":"2017-09-05T11:11:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Satellite Cell Bot","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507221205141577729\/FQlptquo_normal.jpeg","description":"Tweeting articles on muscle stem cells from pubmed RSS feeds.","id_on_source":"MuscleStemCell","tweeter_id":"2788297100","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":228},"tweet_id":"905025485930766340"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MuscleStemCell\/statuses\/905034413506936832","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24798671],"posted_on":"2017-09-05T11:46:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Satellite Cell Bot","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507221205141577729\/FQlptquo_normal.jpeg","description":"Tweeting articles on muscle stem cells from pubmed RSS feeds.","id_on_source":"MuscleStemCell","tweeter_id":"2788297100","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":228},"tweet_id":"905034413506936832"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Loose_Lab_Rat\/statuses\/905046218543390720","license":"gnip","rt":["MuscleStemCell"],"citation_ids":[24798671],"posted_on":"2017-09-05T12:33:28+00:00","author":{"name":"Kelly A.
