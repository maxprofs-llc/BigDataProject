Scientists are consequently striving to identify mechanisms by which functional polymers were selected and further amplified from complex prebiotic mixtures. Here we show the instrumental role of non-enzymatic replication in the enrichment of certain product(s). To this end, we analyzed a complex web of reactions in \u03b2-sheet peptide networks, focusing on the formation of specific intermediate compounds and template-assisted replication. Remarkably, we find that the formation of several products in a mixture is not critically harmful, since efficient and selective template-assisted reactions serve as a backbone correction mechanism, namely, for keeping the concentration of the peptide containing the native backbone equal to, or even higher than, the concentrations of the other products. We suggest that these findings may shed light on molecular evolution processes that led to current biology.The synthesis of biopolymers in living cells is perfected by complex machinery, however this was not the case on early Earth. Here the authors show the role of non-enzymatic replication in the enrichment of certain products within prebiotically relevant mixtures.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Jayanta Nanda","Boris Rubinov","Denis Ivnitski","Rakesh Mukherjee","Elina Shtelman","Yair Motro","Yifat Miller","Nathaniel Wagner","Rivka Cohen-Luria","Gonen Ashkenasy"],"doi":"10.1038\/s41467-017-00463-1","first_seen_on":"2017-09-05T10:51:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2041-1723"],"issue":"1","journal":"Nature Communications","last_mentioned_on":1504781199,"links":["https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41467-017-00463-1","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28874657?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41467-017-00463-1.pdf","pmid":"28874657","pubdate":"2017-09-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"434","subjects":["science","biology"],"title":"Emergence of native peptide sequences in prebiotic replication networks","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/emergence-native-peptide-sequences-prebiotic-replication-networks"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.75,"6m":1.75,"3m":1.75,"1m":1.75,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8380430,"mean":7.062242681602,"rank":3858318,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4438222,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8380430,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123995,"mean":12.064396970821,"rank":52186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":69735,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123995,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13086,"mean":44.679893160107,"rank":10005,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":2891,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13086,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":417,"mean":48.684197115385,"rank":326,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":88,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":417,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1,"Earth and Planetary Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/YousefAbulHaija\/statuses\/905019890289057792","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24797767],"posted_on":"2017-09-05T10:48:50+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr Yousef Abul-Haija","url":"https:\/\/scholar.google.co.uk\/citations?user=JPVJzOsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/792499801237708800\/vMktU5yy_normal.jpg","description":"Postdoc @LeeCronin, PhD @UlijnGroup #supramolecular #systems #chemistry, #materials, #hydrogels, #peptide #nanotechnology.","id_on_source":"YousefAbulHaija","tweeter_id":"223608348","geo":{"lt":55.86515,"ln":-4.25763,"country":"GB"},"followers":319},"tweet_id":"905019890289057792"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/camglyco\/statuses\/905736689657593857","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24797767],"posted_on":"2017-09-07T10:17:09+00:00","author":{"name":"CamGlycoscience","url":"http:\/\/camglyco.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/819687021732040706\/xl7Kg5aF_normal.jpg","description":"Tweeting the latest science about #sugars, #carbohydrates, #CAZymes, etc.","id_on_source":"camglyco","tweeter_id":"819673058885664768","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":262},"tweet_id":"905736689657593857"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PrebioticChem\/statuses\/905744115761115137","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24797767],"posted_on":"2017-09-07T10:46:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Prebiotic Chemistry","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/892340287321903104\/0ax4MahG_normal.jpg","description":"RNA World to the origin of life - Highlights in Prebiotic Chemistry.","id_on_source":"PrebioticChem","tweeter_id":"862582016616919041","geo":{"lt":51.5,"ln":10.5,"country":"DE"},"followers":36},"tweet_id":"905744115761115137"}]}}
