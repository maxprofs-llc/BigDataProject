However, the molecular profile of the primary tumour from the initial surgical specimen might significantly differ from the molecular profile in a tumour sample obtained from a biopsy of a metastatic site.\nWe compare the genetic profile of primary tumours and paired metastases by using a large panel of cancer genes. Training and validation set including a total of 152 primary and metastatic tumour pairs were sequenced (up to 429 genes) focussing on variants described in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC).\nTraining and validation set including a total of 152 primary and metastatic tumour pairs were sequenced focussing on variants described in COSMIC. Agreement rate between the couples of primary and metastasis on COSMIC variants was 65% (24\/37) and 43% (49\/115) in the training and validation cohort, respectively. That rose to 74% (20\/27) and 58% (42\/73) when focussing on targetable mutations. In five cases, the discordance was related to appearance of secondary resistance mutation, giving a targetable refined agreement rate of 67% (67\/100).\nUp to 40% of paired primary tumour\/metastases have discordant molecular profile. Liquid biopsies may overcome, in the near future, the limits of tumour tissue genotyping.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008e9a","authors":["T. Grellety","C. Lucchesi","I. Hostein","C.
