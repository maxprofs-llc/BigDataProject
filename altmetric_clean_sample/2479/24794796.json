As a result, these debilitating parasitic diseases that used to be widely prevalent have been well controlled or eliminated. Consequently, less attention has been paid to parasitic infection during the rapid development of the economy, especially in developed areas. However, our investigations conducted in the parasitological laboratory of Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, Guangdong, China) show that emerging parasitic diseases still threaten many people's health, with 340 of 880 outpatients (38.6%) receiving a diagnosis of parasitic disease, among whom 201 (59.1%) had clonorchiasis and 120 (35.3%) had taeniasis\/cysticercosis. Furthermore, our doctors are not equipped with sufficient parasitology knowledge because this discipline is not able to maintain attraction. Many parasitic infections that result in severe consequences are treatable and preventable, but the phenomena of misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis are common and merit attention.","altmetric_jid":"508ef8443cf0581631000000","authors":["Lan-Gui Song","Xiao-Ying Zheng","Da-Tao Lin","Guang-Xi Wang","Zhong-Dao Wu"],"doi":"10.1186\/s40249-017-0332-0","first_seen_on":"2017-09-05T10:01:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2049-9957"],"issue":"1","journal":"Infectious Diseases of Poverty","last_mentioned_on":1504606595,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28866980?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28866980?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28866980","pubdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Parasitology should not be abandoned: data from outpatient parasitological testing in Guangdong, China","type":"article","volume":"6"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":1.25,"1m":1.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366342,"mean":7.0541652571821,"rank":4218410,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3932778,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366342,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117780,"mean":12.053997164181,"rank":57189,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":55274,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117780,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":316,"mean":3.9507047619048,"rank":169,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":133,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":316,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":2.7285714285714,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MalariaPapers\/statuses\/905007822940844032","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24794796],"posted_on":"2017-09-05T10:00:53+00:00","author":{"name":"Malaria Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/633328476070785024\/zGKHLt0g_normal.png","description":"I'm a bot tweeting papers about malaria as they appear on PubMed (& now preprints on BioRxiv). \n\nRun by @theosanderson.","id_on_source":"MalariaPapers","tweeter_id":"3428446343","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":136},"tweet_id":"905007822940844032"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Nematode_papers\/statuses\/905011771022295041","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24794796],"posted_on":"2017-09-05T10:16:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Nematode_papers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","description":"Twitter bot searching the web for new journal articles on #nematodes","id_on_source":"Nematode_papers","tweeter_id":"2882533695","geo":{"lt":54.58333,"ln":-5.93333,"country":"GB"},"followers":116},"tweet_id":"905011771022295041"}]}}
