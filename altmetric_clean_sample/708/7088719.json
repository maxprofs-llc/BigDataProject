Endoscopy was performed under conscious sedation\/general anesthesia after the informed consent was obtained.\nOne hundred and three patients aged 1-18 years were included in this study. There were 57 males and 46 females with male to female ratio 1.2:1; 43.69% presented with hematemesis, 31.07% had melena and 25.24% had both. The most common causes of UGIB were erosive gastritis (33.98%), followed by esophagitis (14.56%), duodenitis (11.65%), duodenal ulcer (10.68%), gastric ulcer (5.83%), esophageal varices (4.85%), Mallory-Weiss syndrome (1.94%); multiple etiologies counted for 16.50% cases. A certain bleeding source was found in 34.95% cases, a possible one in 39.81% of the patients; the source could not be ascertained in 25.24% of cases. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) consumption was documented in in 17.51% of patients. The incidence of H. pylori infection was 36.89%.\nThe most common cause of of upper GI bleeding in our series was gastritis, followed by oesophagitis and duodenitis. Most of the patients presented with hematemesis; previous consumption of NSAIDs and H. pylori infection were associated with gastroduodenal ulceration and bleeding. Early endoscopy was associated with a higher detection rate of the bleeding source.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081b8","authors":["Gimiga, Nicoleta","Olaru, Claudia","Diaconescu, Smaranda","Miron, Ingrith","Burlea, Marin"],"first_seen_on":"2016-04-30T10:06:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1827-1715"],"issue":"3","journal":"Minerva Pediatrica","last_mentioned_on":1504608503,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27125439?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27125439?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27125439","pubdate":"2016-04-30T22:01:47+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Upper gastrointestinal bleeding in children from a hospital center of Northeast Romania.","type":"article","volume":"68"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0.75,"1m":0.75,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366342,"mean":7.0541652571821,"rank":6049349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2017719,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366342,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271585,"mean":11.582819606457,"rank":173643,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":81939,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271585,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171,"mean":2.4281882352941,"rank":81,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":82,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.2555555555556,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IN":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/statuses\/726351691906314240","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7088719],"posted_on":"2016-04-30T10:05:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
