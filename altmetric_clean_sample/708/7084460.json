Here we present two examples [4-bromo-4'-nitrobiphenyl (BNBP) and 4-bromo-4'-cyanobiphenyl (BCNBP)] which develop into a bipolar final growth state. This means orientational disorder taking place at the crystal\/nutrient interface produces domains of opposite average polarity for as-grown crystals. The spatial inhomogeneous distribution of polarity was investigated by scanning pyroelectric microscopy (SPEM), phase-sensitive second harmonic microscopy (PS-SHM) and selected volume X-ray diffraction (SVXD). As a result, the acceptor groups (NO2 or CN) are predominantly present at crystal surfaces. However, the stochastic process of polarity formation can be influenced by adding a symmetrical biphenyl to a growing system. For this case, Monte Carlo simulations predict an inverted net polarity compared with the growth of pure BNBP and BCNBP. SPEM results clearly demonstrate that 4,4'-dibromobiphenyl (DBBP) can invert the polarity for both crystals. Phenomena reported in this paper belong to the most striking processes seen for molecular crystals, demonstrated by a stochastic process giving rise to symmetry breaking. We encounter here further examples supporting the general thesis that monodomain polar molecular crystals for fundamental reasons cannot exist.","altmetric_jid":"56b367f42a83eea9718b45b9","authors":["Burgener, M.","Burgener, M.","Aboulfadl, H.","Labat, G.C.","Bonin, M.","Sommer, M.","Sankolli, R.","W\u00fcbbenhorst, M.","Hulliger, J."],"doi":"10.1107\/s2052252516006709","endpage":"225","first_seen_on":"2016-04-30T00:00:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2052-2525"],"issue":"3","journal":"IUCrJ","last_mentioned_on":1497504585,"links":["http:\/\/journals.iucr.org\/m\/issues\/2016\/03\/00\/bi5055\/index.html"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.iucr.org\/m\/issues\/2016\/03\/00\/bi5055\/bi5055.pdf","pmcid":"PMC4856144","pmid":"27158508","pubdate":"2016-04-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"International Union of Crystallography","startpage":"219","title":"Peculiar orientational disorder in 4-bromo-4\u2032-nitrobiphenyl (BNBP) and 4-bromo-4\u2032-cyanobiphenyl (BCNBP) leading to bipolar crystals","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/peculiar-orientational-disorder-4bromo4nitrobiphenyl-bnbp-4bromo4cyanobiphenyl-bcnbp-leading-bipolar"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372629,"mean":7.0578283965246,"rank":6054324,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2018892,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372629,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271622,"mean":11.584757555564,"rank":173669,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":81955,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271622,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285,"mean":8.8865563380282,"rank":222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":10.938857142857,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
