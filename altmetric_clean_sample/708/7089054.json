Primary isolated rat MG cells were cocultured with 3T3 feeder cells and a Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibitor (Y-27632) for expansion. Passaged rat MG cells were cultured as planar sheets under air-liquid interface (ALI) conditions for gene expression and electrophysiologic studies. Passaged rat MG cells also were cultured in matrigel matrices to form spheroids, which were examined ultrastructurally by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and functionally using swelling assays.\nExpression of multiple ion channel\/transporter genes was detected in rat MG tissues. \u03b2-ENaC mRNA and protein were localized more to MG peripheral acinar cells than central acinar cells or ductular epithelial cells. Electrophysiologic studies of rat MG cell planar cultures demonstrated functional sodium, chloride, and potassium channels, and cotransporters activities. Transmission electron microscopic analyses of rat MG spheroids revealed highly differentiated MG cells with abundant lysosomal lamellar bodies. Rat MG spheroids culture-based measurements demonstrated active volume regulation by ion channels.\nThis study demonstrates the presence and function of ion channels and volume transport by rat MG. Two novel primary MG cell culture models that may be useful for MG research were established.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007a79","authors":["Yu, Dongfang","Davis, Richard M","Aita, Megumi","Burns, Kimberlie A","Clapp, Phillip W","Gilmore, Rodney C","Chua, Michael","O'Neal, Wanda K","Schlegel, Richard","Randell, Scott H","C Boucher, Richard"],"doi":"10.1167\/iovs.15-17945","first_seen_on":"2016-04-30T10:19:08+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["1552-5783"],"issue":"4","journal":"Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science","last_mentioned_on":1462011513,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27127933?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27127933","pubdate":"2016-04-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"2328","subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Characterization of Rat Meibomian Gland Ion and Fluid Transport","type":"article","volume":"57","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterization-rat-meibomian-gland-ion-fluid-transport"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7628277,"mean":6.5635637575213,"rank":3945621,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2140787,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7628277,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266354,"mean":11.392586161973,"rank":144548,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":95424,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266354,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2670,"mean":2.7200771824653,"rank":1153,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":1155,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2670,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123,"mean":4.4626393442623,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":68,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
