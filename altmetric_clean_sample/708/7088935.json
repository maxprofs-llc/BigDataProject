We investigated the impact of the anatomical location of the pancreas, especially in relation to the suprapancreatic lymph nodes, on the incidence of POPF after LG.\nWe retrospectively reviewed the preoperative computed tomography (CT) images of 246 patients who underwent LG with the suprapancreatic lymph node dissection between November 2008 and November 2015. The length between the levels of the pancreatic body surface and the root of the common hepatic artery (LPC) was measured on a CT image with an axial view. A receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine the cutoff LPC value. A multivariate analysis was performed to determine the predictive factors for POPF.\nPOPF occurred in 11 patients (4.5\u00a0%). The median LPC was significantly longer in the patients with POPF than in those without (26\u00a0mm vs. 21\u00a0mm, p\u00a0=\u00a00.026). The ROC curve analysis revealed that the optimal cutoff LPC value for predicting POPF was 25\u00a0mm. The POPF rate was significantly higher in the long LPC group than in the short LPC group (10 vs. 1.3\u00a0%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). A multivariate analysis demonstrated that a long LPC (p\u00a0=\u00a00.018) and dissection of the lymph nodes along the distal splenic artery (p\u00a0=\u00a00.042) were independent predictors of POPF. The amylase level in the drainage fluid on postoperative day 1 was significantly higher in the long LPC group than in the short LPC group.\nThe LPC is a simple and reliable predictor of POPF after LG. Surgeons should take the anatomical location of the pancreas into consideration when performing LG with suprapancreatic lymph node dissection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100035f7","authors":["Migita, Kazuhiro","Matsumoto, Sohei","Wakatsuki, Kohei","Ito, Masahiro","Kunishige, Tomohiro","Nakade, Hiroshi","Nakatani, Mitsuhiro","Kitano, Mutsuko","Nakajima, Yoshiyuki"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00464-016-4909-7","first_seen_on":"2016-04-30T10:14:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-2218","0930-2794"],"journal":"Surgical Endoscopy","last_mentioned_on":1462011157,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27126620?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27126620","pubdate":"2016-04-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Abdominal Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Gynecology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Hepatology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Proctology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgery","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","diagnosticimaging","gastroenterology"],"title":"The anatomical location of the pancreas is associated with the incidence of pancreatic fistula after laparoscopic gastrectomy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/anatomical-location-pancreas-associated-incidence-pancreatic-fistula-after-laparoscopic-gastrectomy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7628277,"mean":6.5635637575213,"rank":6602291,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7628277,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266354,"mean":11.392590854993,"rank":223049,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266354,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3088,"mean":2.5552529964367,"rank":2383,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3088,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126,"mean":3.1016,"rank":111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
