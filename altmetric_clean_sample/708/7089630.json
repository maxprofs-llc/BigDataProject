Here, we investigated the effect of preanalytical factors on neurofilament concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in a \"reverse\" round-robin with 15 centers across Europe\/U.S.\nSamples from ALS and control patients (5\/5 each center, n\u2009=\u2009150) were analyzed for phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (pNfH) and neurofilament light chain (NfL) at two laboratories.\nCSF pNfH was increased (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in ALS in 10 out of 15 centers and NfL in 5 out of 12 centers. The coefficient of variation (CV%) of pNfH measurements between laboratories was 18.7\u2009\u00b1\u200919.1%. We calculated a diagnostic cut-off of >568.5\u2009pg\/mL for pNfH (sensitivity 78.7%, specificity 93.3%) and >1,431pg\/mL for NfL (sensitivity 79.0%, specificity 86.4%).\nValues in ALS patients are already comparable between most centers, supporting eventual implementation into clinical routine. However, continuous quality control programs will be necessary for inclusion in the diagnostic work-up.","altmetric_jid":"56dd9b6e2a83ee7d288b456f","authors":["Patrick Oeckl","Claude Jardel","Fran\u00e7ois Salachas","Foudil Lamari","Peter M.
