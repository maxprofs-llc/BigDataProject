Although lymph node involvement by tumor yields the most accurate staging and prognostic information in patients with carcinomas of various genitourinary organs, the role of lymph node sampling (LNS) in patients with RCC to definitively establish nodal metastases remains unsettled.\nIn this retrospective study of 399 patients with RCC treated by total nephrectomy, 115 cases were subjected to lymph node dissection.\nThe corresponding primary tumors averaged\u2009>8\u2009cm. Twenty-nine showed positive lymph nodes (25%). The present review confirms that primary tumor size is a key indicator of nodal involvement. Clear cell and papillary tumors\u2009>4\u2009cm involve lymph nodes more commonly than other types of RCC. Sarcomatoid differentiation occurred in all major cell types and existed in numbers too few to predict the likelihood of nodal metastases.\nLNS in RCC for staging purposes may be warranted based on tumor size (>4\u2009cm) as determined by imaging as well as histologic cell type, the latter suggesting a selective role for preoperative fine needle aspiration or core biopsy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021f4","authors":["Mirza, Kamran M","Taxy, Jerome B","Antic, Tatjana"],"doi":"10.1093\/ajcp\/aqw059","first_seen_on":"2016-04-29T19:54:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1943-7722","0002-9173"],"journal":"American Journal of Clinical Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1462139986,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27124952"],"pmid":"27124952","pubdate":"2016-04-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"aqw059","subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Radical Nephrectomy for Renal Cell Carcinoma","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/radical-nephrectomy-renal-cell-carcinoma-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7663900,"mean":6.5828443049629,"rank":3745423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3723282,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7663900,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267087,"mean":11.397499209992,"rank":133397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":123276,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267087,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1245,"mean":4.3281221864952,"rank":693,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":498,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1245,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":5.1870967741935,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/adnan_bakri\/statuses\/726139723991912449","license":"gnip","rt":["PatardJean"],"citation_ids":[7082510],"posted_on":"2016-04-29T20:02:55+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr Adnan El Bakri","url":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/dr-adnan-el-bakri-404869a6\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/859110600110198784\/hKGP5BJg_normal.jpg","description":"MD,PhD candidate.
