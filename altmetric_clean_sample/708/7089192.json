The size of agents is an important factor to the delivery outcome using this method. Liposomes are important drug carriers with controllable sizes in a range of nanometers. However, discrepancies among deliveries of intact liposomes with different sizes, especially those larger than 50\u00a0nm, across the BBB opened by FUS with microbubbles remain unexplored. In the present study, rhodamine-labeled long-circulating pegylated liposomes with diameters of 55\u00a0nm, 120\u00a0nm and 200\u00a0nm were delivered to mice brains after BBB disruption by pulsed FUS with microbubbles. Four groups of peak rarefactional pressure and microbubble dosages were used: 0.53\u00a0MPa with 0.1\u00a0\u03bcL\/g (group 1), 0.53\u00a0MPa with 0.5\u00a0\u03bcL\/g (group 2), 0.64\u00a0MPa with 0.1\u00a0\u03bcL\/g (group 3) and 0.64\u00a0MPa with 0.5\u00a0\u03bcL\/g (group 4). The delivery outcome was observed using fluorescence imaging of brain sections. It was found that the delivery of 55-nm liposomes showed higher success rates than 120-nm or 200-nm liposomes from groups 1-3. The result indicated that it may be more difficult to deliver larger liposomes (>120\u00a0nm) passively than 55-nm liposomes after BBB opening by FUS with microbubbles. The relative fluorescence area of 55-nm liposomes to the total area of the sonicated region was statistically larger than that of the 120-nm or 200-nm liposomes. Increasing peak rarefactional pressure amplitude or microbubble dose could induce more accumulation of liposomes in the brain using FUS with microbubbles. Moreover, the distribution pattern of delivered liposomes was heterogeneous and characterized by separated fluorescence spots with cloud-like periphery surrounding a bright center, indicating confined diffusion in the extracellular matrix after extravasation from the microvasculature. These findings are expected to provide useful information for developing FUS with microbubbles as an effective trans-BBB liposomal drug delivery strategy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036d2","authors":["Shen, Yuanyuan","Guo, Jinxuan","Chen, Gaoshu","Chin, Chien Ting","Chen, Xin","Chen, Jian","Wang, Feng","Chen, Shiguo","Dan, Guo"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ultrasmedbio.2016.01.019","first_seen_on":"2016-04-30T10:23:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-291X"],"journal":"Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology","last_mentioned_on":1462011815,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27126236?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27126236","pubdate":"2016-04-30T22:01:24+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Delivery of Liposomes with Different Sizes to Mice Brain after\u00a0Sonication by Focused Ultrasound in the Presence of\u00a0Microbubbles.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/delivery-liposomes-different-sizes-mice-brain-after-sonication-focused-ultrasound-presence-microbubb"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7628277,"mean":6.5635637575213,"rank":3945621,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2140787,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7628277,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266354,"mean":11.392585223369,"rank":144548,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":95424,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266354,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":534,"mean":2.1714671669794,"rank":229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":230,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":534,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":2.040625,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
