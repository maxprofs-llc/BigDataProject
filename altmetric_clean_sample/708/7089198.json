Our previous study has shown that spironolactone could ameliorate podocytic adhesive capacity in diabetic rats. Autophagy has been reported to have a protective role against renal injury. The present study investigated the underlying mechanisms by which spironolactone reduced adhesive capacity damage in\u00a0podocytes\u00a0under mechanical stress, focusing on the involvement of\u00a0autophagy.\nHuman conditional immortalized podocytes exposed to mechanical stress were treated with spironolactone,\u00a0LY294002 or rapamycin for 48h. The accumulation of LC3 puncta was detected by immunofluorescence staining. Podocyte expresssion of MR, integrin \u03b21, LC3, Atg5, p85PI3K, p-Akt, p-mTOR were detected by Western blotting. Podocyte adhesion to collagen type IV was also performed with spectrophotometry.\nImmunofluorescence staining showed that the normal level of autophagy was reduced in podocytes under mechanical stress. Decreased integrin \u03b21, LC3, Atg5 and abnormal activation of the PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR pathway were also detected in podocytes under mechanical stress. Spironolactone upregulated integrin \u03b21,\u00a0LC3, Atg5 expression, downregulated p85-PI3K, p-Akt, p-mTOR expression and reduced podocytic adhesive capacity damage.\nOur data demonstrated that spironolactone inhibited mechanical-stress-induced podocytic adhesive capacity damage through blocking PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR pathway and restoring\u00a0autophagy activity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f6","authors":["Li, Dong","Yan, Tiekun","Xu, Zhongwei","Jia, Junya","Zheng, Zhenfeng","Lin, Shan","Dong Li","Zhenyu Lu","Zhongwei Xu","Junya Ji","Zhenfeng Zheng","Shan Lin","Tiekun Yan"],"doi":"10.1042\/bsr20160086","endpage":"e00355","first_seen_on":"2016-04-30T10:24:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-4935","0144-8463"],"issue":"4","journal":"Bioscience Reports","last_mentioned_on":1474032895,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27129295?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.bioscirep.org\/content\/36\/4\/e00355.large.jpg?rss=1","http:\/\/www.bioscirep.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/36\/4\/e00355?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.bioscirep.org\/content\/ppbioscirep\/36\/4\/e00355.full.pdf","pmid":"27129295","pubdate":"2016-04-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Portland Press Limited","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e00355","subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"Spironolactone Promotes Autophagy via Inhibiting PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR Pathway and Reduce Adhesive Damage in Podocytes under Mechanical Stress","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/spironolactone-promotes-autophagy-via-inhibiting-pi3kaktmtor-signalling-pathway-reduce-adhesive-capa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8389481,"mean":7.0670107241375,"rank":4233391,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3940136,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8389481,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271746,"mean":11.586377346409,"rank":135740,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":125377,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271746,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":522,"mean":1.7031938579655,"rank":186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":318,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":522,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.175,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
