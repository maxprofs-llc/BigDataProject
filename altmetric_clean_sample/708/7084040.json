The ability to characterize molecular processes noninvasively during a relatively fast whole-body scan is the major advantage of this technology. We reviewed the literature in an attempt to clarify the usefulness of PET\/CT in patient with a renal mass.\nA Pubmed\u00ae search was carried for articles published through September 2015 using the keywords: \"renal,\" \"kidney,\" \"mass,\" \"tumor,\" \"cancer,\" and \"PET\/CT\".\nA total of 158 relevant articles were included in the review. Most diagnostic studies used 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), a marker of glucose metabolism, as radiotracer. The results were quite disappointing, with sensitivity rates in the range of 31.5%-77% for diagnosis of renal cell carcinomas. There were higher success rates for the diagnosis of clear cell carcinomas. Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), an enzyme expressed in 95% of the clear cell carcinomas but neither in normal renal tissue nor in benign or non-clear cell malignancies. A chimeric mouse-human antibody to CAIX labeled with 124I (cG250-girentuximab) was shown to diagnose clear cell tumors with sensitivity of 86.2% and specificity of 85.9%. For diagnosis of metastases, PET\/CT with FDG was shown to be more accurate than CT (94% vs. 89%). Studies with other tracers also show encouraging results. PET\/CT holds a great promise in predicting prognosis and response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Current TKI treatments usually induce only mild lesion shrinkage; thus, assessment of response based on changes in the size of metastases is insufficient. Low FDG uptake before treatment and decreased uptake after 2 cycles of treatment are associated with better survival. Using labeled medications as radiotracers before actual treatment could possibly assist in selecting the most effective medication for a specific patient.\nPET\/CT with FDG currently has lower sensitivity compared to enhanced CT for diagnosis of primary renal masses, but better sensitivity for diagnosis of metastases. Predicting and monitoring response to targeted therapy could direct the clinician toward drug selection or modification during therapy. The possibility of treating patients with advanced RCC with cG250-girentuximab attached to 177Lu-a strong \u03b2-emitter is investigated.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f12","authors":["Ofer N.
