The purpose of this study was to predict the probability of beta-lactam target attainment (PTA) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in adult CF patients based on local microbiological data.\nCF-specific pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained from published data for aztreonam, cefepime, ceftazidime, meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam. Pharmacodynamic modeling was used to determine the PTA for bolus, prolonged infusion, and continuous infusion regimens.\nProlonged infusion of meropenem 2g every 8h performed the best among all regimens tested, with a PTA of 83%. The PTA was increased with both prolonged and continuous infusion; however, no regimen reached the target PTA of >90% against P.aeruginosa in CF patients at our institution.\nProlonged and continuous infusion provided higher PTA than bolus for all regimens. Further investigation of novel regimens in CF patients is needed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d49","authors":["R. Zachary Thompson","Craig A. Martin","Donna R. Burgess","W.
