Little is known about the impact of migration-related separation on mental health of these rural migrants in urban China.\nSurvey data from a random sample of rural-to-urban migrants (n = 1113, aged 18-45) from Wuhan were analyzed. The Domestic Migration Stress Questionnaire (DMSQ), an instrument with four subconstructs, was used to measure migration-related stress. The relationship between spouse\/child separation and stress was assessed using survey estimation methods to account for the multi-level sampling design.\n16.46% of couples were separated from their spouses (spouse-separation only), 25.81% of parents were separated from their children (child separation only). Among the participants who married and had children, 5.97% were separated from both their spouses and children (double separation). Spouse-separation only and double separation did not scored significantly higher on DMSQ than those with no separation. Compared to parents without child separation, parents with child separation scored significantly higher on DMSQ (mean score = 2.88, 95% CI: [2.81, 2.95] vs. 2.60 [2.53, 2.67], p < .05). Stratified analysis by separation type and by gender indicated that the association was stronger for child-separation only and for female participants.\nChild-separation is an important source of migration-related stress, and the effect is particularly strong for migrant women. Public policies and intervention programs should consider these factors to encourage and facilitate the co-migration of parents with their children to mitigate migration-related stress.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Yan Guo","Xinguang Chen","Jie Gong","Fang Li","Chaoyang Zhu","Yaqiong Yan","Liang Wang"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0154252","first_seen_on":"2016-04-29T19:02:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"4","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1462697404,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0154252","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0154252&utm_content=buffera4485&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0154252?journalAlert"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0154252.PDF","pmid":"27124768","pubdate":"2016-04-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0154252","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Association between Spouse\/Child Separation and Migration-Related Stress among a Random Sample of Rural-to-Urban Migrants in Wuhan, China","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-between-spousechild-separation-migrationrelated-stress-among-random-sample-ruraltourban"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7667486,"mean":6.5863981409766,"rank":3747678,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3724476,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7667486,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267110,"mean":11.398619492417,"rank":133416,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":123270,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267110,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109024,"mean":10.243332416096,"rank":57055,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":46616,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109024,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4993,"mean":13.087732371795,"rank":2864,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":1850,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4993,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Psychology":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Unscriptedmhood\/statuses\/726124450752557056","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7081934],"posted_on":"2016-04-29T19:02:14+00:00","author":{"name":"DiSheen Smith","url":"http:\/\/www.disheensmith.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/808912797681811457\/KoQS_Mm7_normal.jpg","description":"Believer.
