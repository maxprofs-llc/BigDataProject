The primary aim of this project was to evaluate the impact of physical activity on the quality and quantity of life of lung cancer survivors.\nBetween January 1, 1997, and December 31, 2009, a total of 1466 lung cancer survivors completed a questionnaire with patient-reported outcomes for quality of life (QOL), demographics, disease and clinical characteristics, and a measure of physical activity (Baecke Questionnaire). Chi-square tests compared lung cancer survivors who reported being physically active versus not on a variety of the other covariates. Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox models evaluated the prognostic importance of physical activity level on Overall Survival (OS).\nRoughly half of the lung cancer survivors had advanced stage disease at the time of survey. Treatment prevalence rates were 61, 54, and 33\u00a0% for surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, respectively. The majority (77\u00a0%) of survivors reported themselves as physically active. Physically active survivors reported greater activity across all individual Baecke items. Lung cancer survivor-reported QOL indicated the benefits of physical activity in all domains. Survivors receiving chemotherapy or radiation at the time of questionnaire completion were less likely to be physically active (74 and 73\u00a0% respectively). In contrast, 84\u00a0% of surgical patients were physically active. Disease recurrence rates were the same for physically active and inactive patients (81\u00a0% vs 82\u00a0%, p\u2009=\u20090.62). Physically active patients survived an average of 4 more years than those who were not physically active (8.4\u00a0years versus 4.4\u00a0years respectively, log rank p\u2009<\u20090.0001).\nBeing physically active was related to profound advantages in QOL and survival in a large sample of lung cancer survivors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000082d","authors":["Jeff A.
