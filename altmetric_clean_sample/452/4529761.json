This process, however, may upset ELF's redox balance, which is deemed to be expressed by the ratio of the major antioxidant glutathione (GSH) to its putative oxidation product GSSG. Previously, we found that at physiological pH O3(g) rapidly oxidizes GS(2-)(aq) (but not GSH(-)) to GSO3(-) rather than GSSG. Here, we report that in moderately acidic pH \u2264 5 media \u00b7OH(g) oxidizes GSH(-)(aq) to sulfenic GSOH(-), sulfinic GSO2(-), and sulfonic GSO3(-) acids via \u00b7OH specific additions to reduced S-atoms. The remarkable specificity of \u00b7OH on water versus its lack of selectivity in bulk water implicates an unprecedented steering process during [OH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7GSH] interfacial encounters. Thus, both O3 and \u00b7OH oxidize GSH to GSOH(-) under most conditions, and since GSOH(-) is reduced back to GSH in vivo by NADPH, redox balance may be in fact signaled by GSH\/GSOH ratios.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dea","authors":["Shinichi Enami","Michael R.
