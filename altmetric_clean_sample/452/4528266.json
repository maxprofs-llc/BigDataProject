In the literature, there are only few cases reported about aural myiasis. It is more common to occur in tropical regions, where humidity and warm weather provide a good environment for this infestation. In this paper, a 12-year-old boy is reported to have unilateral earache for 3-day duration. Examination of the painful ear showed a tympanic membrane perforation with larvae (maggots) in the middle ear. They were removed by using a forceps and gentle irrigation of ear to expel any remnant. Further management included assessment of hearing, computed tomography (CT) scan, and outpatient follow-up.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa7ee3cf058f61000b633","authors":["Al Jabr, Ibrahim"],"doi":"10.1155\/2015\/219529","first_seen_on":"2015-09-18T11:11:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2090-6765"],"journal":"Case Reports in Otolaryngology","last_mentioned_on":1442574663,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26380140?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26380140","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Aural Myiasis, a Rare Cause of Earache.","type":"article","volume":"2015","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aural-myiasis-rare-cause-earache"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6364199,"mean":5.83819851048,"rank":3000031,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1907359,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6364199,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":198838,"mean":9.8421597087062,"rank":107366,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":71455,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":198838,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146,"mean":1.2736551724138,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1.5,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OTO_docs\/statuses\/644830992927059968","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4528266],"posted_on":"2015-09-18T11:11:03+00:00","author":{"name":"OTOdocs","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/451475015045615617\/pvQ7oTD5_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Otolaryngology papers in #PubMed and #arXiv.","id_on_source":"OTO_docs","tweeter_id":"2424371810","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":385},"tweet_id":"644830992927059968"}]}}
