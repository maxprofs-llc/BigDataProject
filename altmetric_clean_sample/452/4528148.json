However, biological screening and chemical analysis of marine extracts pose specific technical constraints and require adequate sample preparation. Here we report an improved method on Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) to fractionate organic extracts containing high concentration of salt that hampers the recovery of secondary metabolites. The procedure uses a water suspension to load the extracts on a poly(styrene-divynylbenzene)-based support and a stepwise organic solvent elution to effectively desalt and fractionate the organic components. The novel protocol has been tested on MeOH-soluble material from three model organisms (Reniera sarai, Dendrilla membranosa and Amphidinium carterae) and was validated on a small panel of 47 marine samples, including sponges and protists, within discovery programs for identification of immuno-stimulatory and anti-infective natural products.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f61000668a","authors":["Cutignano, Adele","Nuzzo, Genoveffa","Ianora, Adrianna","Luongo, Elvira","Romano, Giovanna","Gallo, Carmela","Sansone, Clementina","Aprea, Susanna","Mancini, Francesca","D'Oro, Ugo","Fontana, Angelo"],"doi":"10.3390\/md13095736","first_seen_on":"2015-09-18T10:41:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1660-3397"],"issue":"9","journal":"Marine Drugs","last_mentioned_on":1465500157,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26378547?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-3397\/13\/9\/5736","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26378547?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26378547","pubdate":"2015-09-18T22:00:44+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["biology","pharmacology"],"title":"Development and Application of a Novel SPE-Method for Bioassay-Guided Fractionation of Marine Extracts","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-application-novel-spemethod-bioassayguided-fractionation-marine-extracts"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7876706,"mean":6.669712343671,"rank":3551557,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4246850,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7876706,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233793,"mean":9.2836909047358,"rank":94917,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":134528,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233793,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":998,"mean":3.4914523570712,"rank":381,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":588,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":998,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":2.646275,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
