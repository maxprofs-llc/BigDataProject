Analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) using age, sex, and years of education as covariates compared cognitive performance for the proposed genotypes in patients and controls. ANCOVAs also tested for the epistatic effect of COMT and DRD3 genotype combinations on cognitive performance.\nFor executive functioning, COMT Val\/Val patients performed in a similar range as controls (30.70-33.26 vs. 35.53-35.67), but as COMT Met allele frequency increased, executive functioning worsened. COMT Met\/Met patients carrying the DRD3 Ser\/Ser genotype performed poorest (16.184 vs. 27.388-31.824). Scores of carriers of this COMT\/DRD3 combination significantly differed from all DRD3 Gly\/Gly combinations (p < 0.05), from COMT Val\/Met DRD3 Ser\/Gly (p = 0.02), and from COMT Val\/Val DRD3 Ser\/Ser (p = 0.01) in patients. It also differed significantly from all control scores (p < 0.001).\nCombined genetic polymorphisms related to dopamine neurotransmission might influence executive function in schizophrenia. Looking at the effects of multiple genes on a single disease trait (epistasis) provides a comprehensive and more reliable way to determine genetic effects on endophenotypes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5323cf058f6100044ca","authors":["Loch, Alexandre A","van de Bilt, Martinus T","Bio, Danielle S","Prado, Carolina M do","Sousa, Rafael T de","Valiengo, Leandro L","Moreno, Ricardo A","Zanetti, Marcus V","Gattaz, Wagner F"],"doi":"10.1590\/1516-4446-2014-1553","first_seen_on":"2015-09-17T10:14:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1809-452X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Revista Brasileira de Psiquiatria","last_mentioned_on":1457611103,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26376054?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26376054"],"pmid":"26376054","pubdate":"2015-09-17T22:00:12+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Epistasis between COMT Val158Met and DRD3 Ser9Gly polymorphisms and cognitive function in schizophrenia: genetic influence on dopamine transmission.","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epistasis-between-comt-val158met-drd3-ser9gly-polymorphisms-cognitive-function-schizophrenia-genetic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7377175,"mean":6.4096998099772,"rank":3349722,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3862779,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7377175,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230265,"mean":9.197326494806,"rank":98506,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":123513,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230265,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":1.3856140350877,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":2.86,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
