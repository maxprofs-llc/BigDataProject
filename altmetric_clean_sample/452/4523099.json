Here, we reported two penaeidin isoforms from Litopenaeus vannamei, which were named as Lva-PEN 2 and Lva-PEN 3 according to the respective structure features. The results of amino acid sequence multiple alignments showed that high similarities existed among these penaeidins. A signal peptide sequence and a cysteine-rich domain which contained six cysteine amino acid residues existed in each penaeidin at the same time. Besides, there was a proline-rich motif which was composed of eight proline residues existed in each penaeidin. After the expression profile analysis was studied, we found that both Lva-pen 2 and Lva-pen 3 transcripts were up-regulated at 48\u00a0h after bacteria challenge. Except for the antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria like other penaeidins, these two penaeidins could strongly bind to bacteria and possessed antiproteinase activity. It was speculated that these two penaeidins could prevent bacteria pervasion through bacteria-binding activity and antiproteinase activity. Meantime, the proline-rich motif played a crucial role in these biological processes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a88","authors":["Du, Zhi-Qiang","Jin, Yan-Hui"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12010-015-1840-7","first_seen_on":"2015-09-17T11:19:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1559-0291"],"journal":"Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1442488773,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26373944?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26373944","pubdate":"2015-09-17T22:00:57+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemistry","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology","biochemistry"],"title":"Molecular Characterization and Antibacterial Activity Analysis of Two Novel Penaeidin Isoforms from Pacific White Shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-characterization-antibacterial-activity-analysis-two-novel-penaeidin-isoforms-pacific-whit"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6361288,"mean":5.8388473131307,"rank":5419159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6361288,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":198192,"mean":9.8314577251238,"rank":158359,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":198192,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":658,"mean":1.2128432267884,"rank":356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":658,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":0.55566037735849,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
