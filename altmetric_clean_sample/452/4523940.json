FPSE utilizes a flexible fabric surface as the substrate platform for creating sol-gel hybrid organic-inorganic sorbent coatings. FPSE media can be introduced directly into the sample containing the target analyte(s), requiring no need for prior sample pre-treatment or clean-up. Benzodiazepines were selected as model analytes since they represent one of the most widely used therapeutic drugs in psychiatry and are also amongst the most frequently encountered drugs in forensic toxicology. The chromatographic separation of target analytes was performed on a LiChroCART-LiChrospher\u00ae100 RP-18e (5\u2009\u00b5m, 250\u2009\u00d7\u20094 mm) analytical column, operated at room temperature. Ternary gradient elution was applied with a mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile, methanol and ammonium acetate (0.05\u2009M), which was delivered at a flow rate of 1.0\u2009mL\/min. Diode array detection was performed with monitoring at 240 nm. FPSE was performed using cellulose fabric extraction media coated with sol-gel poly(ethylene glycol) (sol-gel PEG). Absolute recovery values at the equilibrium state for the examined benzodiazepines were found to be 27% for bromazepam, 63% for lorazepam, 42 % for diazepam and 39% for alprazolam.
