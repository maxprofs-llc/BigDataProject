Mononuclear [CoL(Cl)(TMEDA)] () and heterobimetallic [CoL2(\u03bc-Cl)Li(THF)3] () were obtained by direct metathetical reactions of anhydrous CoCl2 with one molar equivalent of [LiL(TMEDA)] () (TMEDA = Me2NCH2CH2NMe2) and [LiL(THF)3] (), respectively. Complex underwent facile ligand substitution reactions with LiMe and NaN3, yielding the corresponding mixed-ligand complexes [CoL(X)(TMEDA)] (X = Me , N3). Treatment of with NaOMe led to the heterobimetallic complex [CoL2(\u03bc-OMe)Na(TMEDA)] (). The solid-state structures of complexes were established by X-ray diffraction analysis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Shuang Yao","Dennis Yiu Sun Tam","Pak Shing Cheung","Chi-Keung Lam","Pei Guo","Sik Lok Lam","H K Lee","Hung Kay Lee"],"doi":"10.1039\/c5dt00796h","endpage":"17959","first_seen_on":"2015-09-18T10:32:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1477-9234"],"issue":"41","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1442573126,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2015\/DT\/C5DT00796H?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=inorganicnews"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2015\/dt\/c5dt00796h","pmid":"26418474","pubdate":"2015-09-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"17950","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"A Monodentate Arylamido System Featuring a Highly Electron-withdrawing C6F5 Substituent.
