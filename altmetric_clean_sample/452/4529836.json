This study investigates witnessed falls to correlate the fall characteristics with the extent of injury.\nCase-control study of children aged \u226448\u2005months who attended one hospital following a fall from <3\u2005m (10\u2005ft), comparing cases who sustained a skull fracture or intracranial injury (ICI) with controls, who had minor head injuries. Characteristics included: the mechanism of injury, surface of impact, site of impact to the head and fall height.\nForty-seven children had a skull fracture or ICI, while 416 children had minor head injuries. The mean fall height for minor head injuries was significantly lower than that causing skull fracture\/ICI (p<0.001). No skull fracture\/ICI was recorded in children who fell <0.6\u2005m (2\u2005ft), based on the height of the head centre of gravity. Skull fractures\/ICI were more likely in children aged \u226412\u2005months (p<0.001) from impacts to the temporal\/parietal or occipital region (p<0.001), impacts onto wood (p=0.004) and falls from a carer's arms, particularly when on stairs (p<0.001). No significant difference was reported between the mean fall heights of children who had a simple skull fracture (n=17) versus those who had a complex fracture or ICI (n=30).\nAn infant is more likely to sustain a skull fracture\/ICI from a fall above a 0.6\u2005m (2\u2005ft) threshold, based on the height of the head centre of gravity, or with a parietal\/temporal or occipital impact. These variables should be recorded when evaluating the likelihood of skull fracture\/ICI.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002302","authors":["Jonathon Hughes","Sabine Maguire","Michael Jones","Peter Theobald","Alison Kemp"],"doi":"10.1136\/archdischild-2014-306803","first_seen_on":"2015-09-18T19:38:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["14682044","1468-2044"],"journal":"Archives of Disease in Childhood","last_mentioned_on":1442769574,"links":["http:\/\/adc.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/09\/17\/archdischild-2014-306803.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/adc.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/09\/17\/archdischild-2014-306803.full.pdf","pmid":"26384509","pubdate":"2015-09-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd and Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"archdischild-2014-306803","title":"Biomechanical characteristics of head injuries from falls in children younger than 48\u2005months","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biomechanical-characteristics-head-injuries-falls-children-younger-48months"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6375336,"mean":5.8453546246599,"rank":2753613,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":3567221,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6375336,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":198957,"mean":9.8443573252378,"rank":95566,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":101316,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":198957,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2748,"mean":6.7184827084092,"rank":1680,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":1045,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2748,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":8.3788,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
