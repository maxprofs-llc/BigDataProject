A metaproteogenomic","Bacterial communities in freshwater sediments adapt to high metal levels w\/o broad changes in population structure"],"citation":{"abstract":"The aim of the study was to understand the effect of a long-term metal exposure (110 years) on sediment microbial communities. Two freshwater sites, F\u00e9rin and MetalEurop, differing by one order of magnitude in metal levels (MetalEurop: 3218\u2009mg\u2009Zn\u2009kg(-1) ; 913\u2009mg\u2009Pb\u2009kg(-1) ) were compared by shotgun metaproteogenomics. A total of 69-118\u2009Mpb of DNA and 943-1241 proteins were obtained. PhymmBL analysis of the DNA sequences indicated that the phylogenetic profile was similar in both stations and that \u03b2-Proteobacteria were dominant. However, subtle but significant changes were observed for some bacteria: e.g. Pseudomonas (+0.4%), Leptothrix (-0.4%), Thiobacillus (+0.36%) and Acidovorax (+0.48%). Using the stamp software, the two communities were found to be functionally very similar. However, significant genetic differences (10(-6) \u2009<\u2009P\u2009<\u200910(-3) ) were observed for three SEED categories: synthesis of exopolymeric substances, virulence and defence mechanisms (including czcA metal efflux genes), and elements involved in horizontal gene transfer. The CzcA protein was found by metaproteomics in MetalEurop, but the levels were too low to allow comparisons. It is concluded that bacterial communities in freshwater sediments may adapt to high metal levels without broad changes in the structure of the population.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027ea","authors":["Gillan, David C.","Roosa, St\u00e9phanie","Kunath, Benoit","Billon, Gabriel","Wattiez, Ruddy"],"doi":"10.1111\/1462-2920.12627","endpage":"2005","first_seen_on":"2014-09-22T12:21:12+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1462-2920","1462-2912"],"issue":"6","journal":"Environmental Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1412051301,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1462-2920.12627\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25244307?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1462-2920.12627\/abstract?campaign=wolacceptedarticle"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1462-2920.12627\/pdf","pmid":"25244307","pubdate":"2014-10-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"1991","subjects":["environmentalhealth","microbiology"],"title":"The long\u2010term adaptation of bacterial communities in metal\u2010contaminated sediments.
