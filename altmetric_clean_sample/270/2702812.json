As the area advances, more detailed insights of dynamic wetting interactions on these surfaces are needed. In particular, the coalescence of two or more droplets on ultra-low adhesion surfaces leads to droplet jumping. Here we show, through detailed measurements of jumping droplets during water condensation coupled with numerical simulations of binary droplet coalescence, that this process is fundamentally inefficient with only a small fraction of the available excess surface energy (\u22726%) convertible into translational kinetic energy. These findings clarify the role of internal fluid dynamics during the jumping droplet coalescence process and underpin the development of systems that can harness jumping droplets for a wide range of applications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006816","authors":["Ryan Enright","Enright R","Miljkovic N","Sprittles JE","Nolan K","Mitchell R","Wang EN","Nenad Miljkovic","James Sprittles","Kevin Nolan","Robert Mitchell","Evelyn N.
