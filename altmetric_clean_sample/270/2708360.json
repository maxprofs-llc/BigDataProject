A recent genome-wide association study identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, rs1625579) in microRNA-137 (miR-137) as a possible susceptibility locus for SCZ. Hoping to validate this finding, we conducted a case-control study of the Han Chinese population, with 506 SCZ cases and 522 healthy controls, using the Ligase detection reaction-polymerase chain reaction method to genotype the polymorphism rs1625579 in the miR-137 gene. However, we found no significant difference (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05) in either allele or genotype frequency in this SNP between patients and controls. In addition, a meta-analysis indicated that the 'T' allele of SNP rs1625579 was not associated with susceptibility to SCZ in Han Chinese populations (pooled OR 1.087, 95\u00a0% CI 0.847-1.396, P\u00a0=\u00a00.512). Thus, these results do not support the previous finding suggesting further replication studies using a large-scale association analysis that should be warranted in Han Chinese populations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037bf","authors":["Jianmin Yuan","Zaohuo Cheng","Fuquan Zhang","Zhenhe Zhou","Shui Yu","Chunhui Jin"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00438-014-0924-3","first_seen_on":"2014-09-23T20:58:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1617-4623"],"journal":"Molecular Genetics & Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1428401168,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25241074?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25241074","pubdate":"2014-09-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Animal Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Genetics & Genomics","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","genetics"],"title":"Lack of association between microRNA-137 SNP rs1625579 and schizophrenia in a replication study of Han Chinese.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lack-association-between-microrna137-snp-rs1625579-schizophrenia-replication-study-han-chinese"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4968551,"mean":5.8840277517613,"rank":3514636,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":813828,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4968551,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":134130,"mean":8.5741705969627,"rank":91269,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":26182,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":134130,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":381,"mean":1.7137736842105,"rank":276,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":62,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":381,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":1.3065333333333,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
