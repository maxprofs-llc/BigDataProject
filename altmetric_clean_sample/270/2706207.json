Lipid intake by dairy cattle must be restricted to prevent alterations of microbial populations in the rumen that can negatively affect milk yield. Unsaturated fatty acids consumed by cattle are extensively metabolized through biohydrogenation, intermediates of which include conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and trans-monoenoic acid isomers. Three specific CLA intermediates of biohydrogenation have been shown to cause milk fat depression in dairy cattle through coordinated suppression of mammary lipogenic genes by a transcription factor that is a central regulator of lipid synthesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008c6d","authors":["Thomas C Jenkins","Kevin J Harvatine"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cvfa.2014.07.006","first_seen_on":"2014-09-23T10:25:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1558-4240"],"journal":"Veterinary Clinics of North America: Food Animal Practice","last_mentioned_on":1411467694,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25239061?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25239061","pubdate":"2014-09-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Lipid Feeding and Milk Fat Depression.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lipid-feeding-milk-fat-depression"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4288018,"mean":5.0089731062087,"rank":3399367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":124002,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4288018,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114645,"mean":8.0223828896411,"rank":90512,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":680,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114645,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":1.5053191489362,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
