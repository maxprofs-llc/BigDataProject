The present research examined associations among Five Factor Model personality traits, motives for gambling, and gambling behavior and problems using latent class analysis. College students (N\u00a0=\u00a0220) completed online measures of personality and gambling behavior as part of a larger intervention trial. Agreeableness and conscientiousness were negatively associated with indicators of gambling behavior. Low agreeableness and high neuroticism were associated with gambling-specific motives, particularly for less frequently endorsed motives. Personality-based latent class analyses of emerging adult gamblers revealed support for three distinct groups reflecting a resilient personality group, a normative personality group, and a vulnerable personality group, which were further differentiated by gambling behaviors and gambling-specific motives. Associations between personality traits and gambling-specific motives highlight potential heterogeneity among college students who gamble. Together, findings suggest that the correlational and latent class-based analyses, as well as the personality and motivation analyses, present complementary information with respect to the attributes of college student gamblers. Implications and future research directions are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002db5","authors":["Tackett JL","Rodriguez LM","Rinker DV","Neighbors C"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10899-014-9500-3","first_seen_on":"2014-09-23T15:51:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1050-5350"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Gambling Studies","last_mentioned_on":1413189048,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25228408"],"pmid":"25228408","pubdate":"2014-09-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Community and Environmental Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Economics general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychiatry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Sociology, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Tourism","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Sociology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"A Personality-Based Latent Class Analysis of Emerging Adult Gamblers.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/personalitybased-latent-class-analysis-emerging-adult-gamblers-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8313718,"mean":7.0058746851653,"rank":4121444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":4128461,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8313718,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193889,"mean":7.9317009923256,"rank":85166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":106757,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193889,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":418,"mean":6.3908729016787,"rank":237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":418,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":14.70875,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
