Subsequent metal-exchange reactions of 2a-d with [Pd(OAc)(8-Me-quin-H)]2 (3) yielded the desired C(sp(3)), N-chelated and o-aryloxide-NHC-ligated palladacycle complexes 4a-d in 60-80% yields. When the N-tert-butyl substituted o-hydroxyaryl imidazolium pro-ligand 1e reacted with 3 in the presence of K2CO3 in dioxane, the palladacycle complex 4e, in which the NHC adopted an abnormal binding (C4-bonding), was obtained in 20% yield. All these complexes were fully characterized using (1)H and (13)C NMR spectra, high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), and elemental analysis. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis results further confirmed the molecular structures of 4a-c and the abnormal binding of NHC in 4e. With methylaluminoxane (MAO) as the cocatalyst these palladacycles showed excellent catalytic activities of up to 10(7) g of PNB (mol of Pd)(-1) h(-1) in the addition polymerization of norbornene.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Liang Dang","Jing Guo","Haibin Song","Binyuan Liu","Baiquan Wang"],"doi":"10.1039\/c4dt02198c","endpage":"17183","first_seen_on":"2014-09-24T09:56:05+00:00","issns":["1477-9234","1477-9226"],"issue":"45","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1411552506,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2014\/DT\/C4DT02198C"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2014\/dt\/c4dt02198c","pmid":"25317849","pubdate":"2014-10-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"17177","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Synthesis, Structures, and Norbornene Polymerization Behavior of C(sp3), N-Chelated Palladacycles Bearing o-Aryloxide-N-Heterocyclic Carbene Ligands","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-structures-norbornene-polymerization-behavior-csp-3-nchelated-palladacycles-bearing-oarylo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4292858,"mean":5.0025835011942,"rank":3400675,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":124210,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4292858,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114862,"mean":8.002111647992,"rank":90513,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":685,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114862,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7637,"mean":1.2935479308538,"rank":7257,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7637,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":2.2363636363636,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
