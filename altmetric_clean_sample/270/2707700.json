Tetrahydroisoquinoline 12 was identified as a potent HDAC6 and HDAC8 dual inhibitor from a focused library through cellular tubulin acetylation and p21 induction screening assays. Scaffold hopping from 12 led to the discovery of an aminotetralin class of HDAC inhibitors. In particular, the 3-R stereoisomer 32 showed highly potent inhibition against HDAC6 and HDAC8 with IC50 values of 50 nM and 80 nM, respectively. Treatment of neuroblastoma BE(2)C cells with 32 resulted in elevated levels of acetylated tubulin, TrkA and neurite outgrowth with only marginal effects on p21 induction and histone H3 acetylation. Consistent with its weak enzymatic inhibition of HDAC1, 32 showed significantly less cytotoxicity than SAHA and moderately inhibited the growth of myeloma NCI-H929 and OPM-2 cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e47","authors":["Guozhi Tang","Jason Christopher Wong","Weixing Zhang","Zhanguo Wang","Nan Zhang","Zhenghong Peng","Zhenshan Zhang","Yiping Rong","Shijie Li","Meifang Zhang","Lingjie Yu","Teng Feng","Xiongwen Zhang","Xihan Wu","Jim Z Wu","Li Chen"],"doi":"10.1021\/jm5008962","first_seen_on":"2014-09-23T16:42:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-4804"],"journal":"Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1411490483,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25238284?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25238284","pubdate":"2014-09-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Identification of a Novel Aminotetralin Class of HDAC6 and HDAC8 Selective Inhibitors.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-novel-aminotetralin-class-hdac6-hdac8-selective-inhibitors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4288018,"mean":5.0089731062087,"rank":3399393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":124007,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4288018,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114645,"mean":8.0219525313144,"rank":90523,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":692,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114645,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3132,"mean":3.2097725966145,"rank":2413,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":409,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3132,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":2.8712682926829,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
