Markers of kidney and liver function (i.e., cystatin C and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)) are elevated in obese individuals and associated with poor neurocognitive outcomes in other samples. Bariatric surgery can improve cystatin C and ALP levels, but no study has examined whether such changes correspond to post-operative cognitive benefits.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f6e","authors":["Alosco ML","Spitznagel MB","Strain G","Devlin M","Cohen R","Crosby RD","Mitchell JE","Gunstad J"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jns.2014.07.037","first_seen_on":"2014-09-21T18:56:24+00:00","funders":["nhlbi"],"issns":["0022-510X"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of the Neurological Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1411297200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25073570"],"pmid":"25073570","pubdate":"2014-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"The effects of cystatin C and alkaline phosphatase changes on cognitive function 12-months after bariatric surgery.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-cystatin-c-alkaline-phosphatase-changes-cognitive-function-12months-after-bariatric-surgery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4280204,"mean":5.0260385622132,"rank":404292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":3846888,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4280204,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113511,"mean":8.0810737908556,"rank":15715,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":97446,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113511,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1209,"mean":2.4265546357616,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":1135,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1209,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":1.6988333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
