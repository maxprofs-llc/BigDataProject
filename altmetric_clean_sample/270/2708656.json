The G2P[4] detection rate among RVA positive samples was 0\/157 in 2001, 3\/226 (1.3%) in 2002, 0\/514 in 2003, 0\/651 in 2004, 31\/344(9%)\/2005, 112\/227(49%)\/2006, 139\/211(66%)\/2007, 240\/284(85%)\/2008, 66\/176(37,5%)\/2009, 367\/422(87%)\/2010 and 75\/149(50%)\/2011. For the VP7 and VP8\u2217 encoding genes, 52 sequences were analyzed and shared up to 99% nucleotide identity with other contemporary G2P[4] strains detected worldwide, grouping into different clusters. Most differences inside antigenic epitopes of VP7 and VP8\u2217 have been maintained in the G2P[4] Brazilian strains along the years, and all were present before RV1 introduction. Eleven G2P[4] strains (4-vaccinated\/7-non-vaccinated) were completely characterized and possessed the typical DS-1-like genotype constellation (G2-P[4]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H2) sharing up to 99% of nucleotide identity with contemporary worldwide strains. Reassortments between Brazilian G2P[4] human strains were observed. In conclusion, the data obtained in the current study suggests that implementation of RV1 vaccination might not influence the genetic diversity observed in G2P[4] analyzed strains. Several factors might have contributed to the increased prevalence of this genotype in Brazil since 2005: the introduction of RV1 into the Brazilian National Immunization Program has resulted in a decrease in the relative prevalence of predominant Wa-like RVA strains facilitating the increase of the heterotypic (DS-1-like) RVA strain G2P[4] in the Brazilian population; the genetic diversity found in different geographical regions throughout the years before, and after the introduction of RV1; the long period of low or no circulation of this genotype in Brazil previous to RV1 introduction could have created favorable conditions for the accumulation of immunological susceptible individuals.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ac3","authors":["Mariela Mart\u00ednez G\u00f3mez","Filipe Anibal Carvalho-Costa","Eduardo de Mello Volot\u00e3o","Tatiana Lundgren Rose","Marcelle Figueira Marques da Silva","Alexandre Madi Fialho","Rosane Maria S Assis","Juliana da Silva Ribeiro de Andrade","Ana Caroline Costa S\u00e1","Mark Zeller","Elisabeth Heylen","Jelle Matthijnssens","Jos\u00e9 Paulo Gagliardi Leite"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.meegid.2014.09.012","first_seen_on":"2014-09-23T23:31:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1567-7257"],"journal":"Infection, Genetics & Evolution","last_mentioned_on":1411515073,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25239525?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25239525","pubdate":"2014-09-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology","communicablediseases","genetics"],"title":"Prevalence and genomic characterization of G2P[4] group A rotavirus strains during monovalent vaccine introduction in Brazil.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-genomic-characterization-g2p4-group-rotavirus-strains-during-monovalent-vaccine-introduct"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4288018,"mean":5.0089731062087,"rank":3399409,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":124002,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4288018,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114645,"mean":8.0225429503508,"rank":90525,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":680,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114645,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":694,"mean":1.9089725829726,"rank":483,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":694,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":1.0238095238095,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
