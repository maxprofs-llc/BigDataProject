On 4 May, before the diagnosis of Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF) was confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an isolation ward was created at Kikwit General Hospital. On 11 May, an international scientific and technical committee established as a priority the improvement of hygienic conditions in the hospital and the protection of health care workers and family members; to this end, protective equipment was distributed and barrier-nursing techniques were implemented. For patients living far from Kikwit, home care was organized. Initially, hospitalized patients were given only oral treatments; however, toward the end of the epidemic, infusions and better nutritional support were given, and 8 patients received blood from convalescent EHF patients. Only 1 of the transfusion patients died (12.5%). It is expected that with improved medical care, the case fatality rate of EHF could be reduced.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002df6","authors":["Y Guimard","M A Bwaka","R Colebunders","P Calain","M Massamba","A De Roo","K D Mupapa","K Kibadi","K J Kuvula","D E Ndaberey","K R Katwiki","B B Mapanda","O B Nkuku","Y Fleerackers","E Van den Enden","M A Kipasa"],"doi":"10.1086\/514315","first_seen_on":"2014-09-23T00:56:17+00:00","issns":["0022-1899"],"journal":"Journal of Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1411469297,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9988194"],"pmid":"9988194","pubdate":"1999-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Organization of patient care during the Ebola hemorrhagic fever epidemic in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 1995.","type":"article","volume":"179 Suppl 1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/organization-patient-care-during-ebola-hemorrhagic-fever-epidemic-kikwit-democratic-republic-congo-1-9"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4288018,"mean":5.0089731062087,"rank":2383511,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1151142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4288018,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114646,"mean":8.0218514893804,"rank":62661,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":32089,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114646,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3203,"mean":5.1286071205497,"rank":1800,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":921,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3203,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93,"mean":3.7995434782609,"rank":57,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
