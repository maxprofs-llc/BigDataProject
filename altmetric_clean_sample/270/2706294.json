The majority of new compounds demonstrated a superior cytotoxicity than doxorubicin against a panel of mammalian tumor cells with determinants of altered drug response, that is, Pgp expression or p53 inactivation. For naphtho[2,3-f]indole-5,10-diones 6-9 bearing 3-aminopyrrolidine in the side chains, the ability to bind double-stranded DNA and inhibit topoisomerases 1 and 2 mediated relaxation of supercoiled DNA were demonstrated. Only one isomer, (R)-4,11-dihydroxy-3-((pyrrolidin-3-ylamino)methyl)-1H-naphtho[2,3-f]indole-5,10-dione (7) induced the formation of specific DNA cleavage products similar to the known topoisomerase 1 inhibitors camptothecin and indenoisoquinoline MJ-III-65, suggesting a role of the structure of the side chain of 3-aminomethylnaphtho[2,3-f]indole-5,10-diones in interaction with the target. Compound 7 demonstrated an antitumor activity in mice with P388 leukemia transplants whereas its enantiomer 6 was inactive. Thus, 3-aminomethyl derivatives of 4,11-dihydroxynaphtho[2,3-f]indole-5,10-dione emerge as a new prospective chemotype for the search of antitumor agents.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000283d","authors":["Andrey E Shchekotikhin","Valeria A Glazunova","Lyubov G Dezhenkova","Yuri N Luzikov","Vladimir N Buyanov","Helena M Treshalina","Nina A Lesnaya","Vladimir I Romanenko","Dmitry N Kaluzhny","Jan Balzarini","Keli Agama","Yves Pommier","Alexander A Shtil","Maria N Preobrazhenskaya"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ejmech.2014.09.021","first_seen_on":"2014-09-23T10:33:34+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1768-3254"],"journal":"European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1411467304,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25244612?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25244612","pubdate":"2014-09-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Synthesis and evaluation of new antitumor 3-aminomethyl-4,11-dihydroxynaphtho[2,3-f]indole-5,10-diones.","type":"article","volume":"86C","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-evaluation-new-antitumor-3aminomethyl411dihydroxynaphtho23findole510diones"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":3052055,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":937007,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119368,"mean":8.1328875652402,"rank":75184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":31490,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119368,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":632,"mean":1.0760348652932,"rank":255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":632,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":0.541,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
