Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encodes an IL-10 homologue (vIL-10) expressed during productive (lytic) infection and induces expression of cellular IL-10 (cIL-10) during latency. This study explored the role of vIL-10 in a murine gammaherpesvirus (MHV) model of viral infection.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000082f","authors":["Lindquester GJ","Greer KA","Stewart JP","Sample JT"],"doi":"10.1186\/2042-4280-5-1","first_seen_on":"2014-09-24T05:02:01+00:00","issns":["2042-4280",""],"issue":"1","journal":"Herpesviridae","last_mentioned_on":1412299475,"links":["http:\/\/www.herpesviridae.org\/content\/5\/1\/1\/abstract","http:\/\/www.herpesviridae.org\/content\/5\/1\/1\/abstract#"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.herpesviridae.org\/content\/pdf\/2042-4280-5-1.pdf","pmcid":"PMC4199788","pmid":"25324959","pubdate":"2014-09-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","startpage":"1","title":"Epstein-Barr virus IL-10 gene expression by a recombinant murine gammaherpesvirus in vivo enhances acute pathogenicity but does not affect latency or reactivation","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epsteinbarr-virus-il10-gene-expression-recombinant-murine-gammaherpesvirus-vivo-enhances-acute-patho"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506051,"mean":5.113311188876,"rank":2977785,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1396004,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506051,"percentile":30},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119487,"mean":8.0916985588271,"rank":70943,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":44039,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119487,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":2.4492307692308,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
