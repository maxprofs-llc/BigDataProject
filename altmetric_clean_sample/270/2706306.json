LWDH genes were extracted from the existing literatures based on text mining technology. To simulate the complex molecular interactions that occur in the whole body, protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs) were constructed and the topological properties of LWDH genes were analyzed. LWDH genes have higher centrality properties and may play important roles in the complex biological network environment. It was also found that the distances within LWDH genes are smaller than expected, which means that the communication of LWDH genes during the biological process is rapid and effectual. At last, a comprehensive network of LWDH genes, including the related drugs and regulatory pathways at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels, was constructed and analyzed. The biological network analysis strategy used in this study may be helpful for the understanding of molecular mechanism of TCM.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef852a83ee09648b548f","authors":["Mingzhi Liao","Yingbo Miao","Liangcai Zhang","Yang Wang","Rennan Feng","Lei Yang","Shihua Zhang","Yongshuai Jiang","Guiyou Liu"],"doi":"10.1155\/2014\/484926","first_seen_on":"2014-09-23T10:34:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2314-6141"],"journal":"BioMed Research International","last_mentioned_on":1411467256,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25243143?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25243143","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"System Analysis of LWDH Related Genes Based on Text Mining in Biological Networks.","type":"article","volume":"2014","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/system-analysis-lwdh-related-genes-based-text-mining-biological-networks"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4759378,"mean":5.7095406108846,"rank":2526818,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1585803,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4759378,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127259,"mean":8.5982892548996,"rank":65916,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":46393,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127259,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":620,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":1.85875,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
