A review."],"citation":{"abstract":"Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been developed and modified to treat anxiety symptoms in youth with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders (ASD) but has yielded varying findings. The present report is a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the efficacy of CBT for anxiety among youth with ASD. A systematic search identified 14 studies involving 511 youth with high-functioning ASD. A random effects meta-analysis yielded a statistically significant pooled treatment effect size (g) estimate for CBT (g\u00a0=\u00a0-0.71, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) with significant heterogeneity [Q (13)\u00a0=\u00a0102.27, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001]. Removal of a study outlier yielded a statistically significant pooled treatment effect size, (g\u00a0=\u00a0-0.47, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Anxiety informant and treatment modality were not statistically significant moderators of treatment response. Findings suggest that CBT demonstrates robust efficacy in reducing anxiety symptoms in youth with high-functioning ASD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002506","authors":["Danielle Ung","Robert Selles","Brent J Small","Eric A Storch","Ung D","Selles R","Small BJ","Storch EA"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10578-014-0494-y","endpage":"547","first_seen_on":"2014-09-24T08:31:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1573-3327","0009-398X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Child Psychiatry & Human Development","last_mentioned_on":1413189960,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25246292","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/25246292\/","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10578-014-0494-y#page-1"],"pmid":"25246292","pubdate":"2014-09-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Child and School Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychiatry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"533","subjects":["psychiatry","pediatrics"],"title":"A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Anxiety in Youth with High-Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorders","type":"article","volume":"46","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/systematic-review-metaanalysis-cognitivebehavioral-therapy-anxiety-youth-highfunctioning-autism-spec-9"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.64,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.64},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8018171,"mean":6.7796668095046,"rank":684948,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7333621,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8018171,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192451,"mean":7.8107517485063,"rank":20362,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":172088,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192451,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":390,"mean":4.3060976863753,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":368,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":390,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":12.741411764706,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":17,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
