Many rhizobia bacteria are able to influence the immune system of host plants by inducing resistance towards pathogenic microorganisms. In this report, we present a translational approach in which we demonstrate the resistance-inducing effect of Ensifer meliloti (Sinorhizobium meliloti) on crop plants that have a significant impact on the worldwide economy and on human nutrition. Ensifer meliloti is usually associated with root nodulation in legumes and nitrogen fixation. Here, we suggest that the ability of S.\u2009meliloti to induce resistance depends on the production of the quorum-sensing molecule, oxo-C14-HSL. The capacity to enhanced resistance provides a possibility to the use these beneficial bacteria in agriculture. Using the Arabidopsis-Salmonella model, we also demonstrate that the application of N-acyl-homoserine lactones-producing bacteria could be a successful strategy to prevent plant-originated infections with human pathogens.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f610004206","authors":["Casandra Hern\u00e1ndez-Reyes","Sebastian T Schenk","Christina Neumann","Karl-Heinz Kogel","Adam Schikora","Hern\u00e1ndez\u2010Reyes, Casandra","Schenk, Sebastian T.","Neumann, Christina","Kogel, Karl\u2010Heinz","Schikora, Adam"],"doi":"10.1111\/1751-7915.12177","endpage":"588","first_seen_on":"2014-09-23T08:32:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1751-7915",""],"issue":"6","journal":"Microbial Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1434561365,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/25234390\/?i=9&from=(Williams%20P%20AND%20Camara%20M)%20OR%20(Williams%20P%20AND%20Winzer%20K)%20OR%20(Atkinson%20S%20AND%20quorum)%20OR%20(Atkinson%20S%20AND%20yersinia)%20OR%20(Williams%20P%20AND%20quorum)%20OR%20(Heeb%20S%20AND%20quorum)%20OR%20(Camara%20M%20AND%20quorum)%20OR%20%22quorum%20sensing%22%20OR%20%22autoinducer%22","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1751-7915.12177\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25234390?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1751-7915.12177\/pdf","pmid":"25234390","pubdate":"2014-09-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"580","subjects":["biotechnology","microbiology"],"title":"N-acyl-homoserine lactones-producing bacteria protect plants against plant and human pathogens.","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nacylhomoserine-lactonesproducing-bacteria-protect-plants-against-plant-human-pathogens"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6317662,"mean":5.9743641477447,"rank":2584381,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3592596,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6317662,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156468,"mean":8.3021516230261,"rank":65592,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":85840,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156468,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":182,"mean":3.2638232044199,"rank":74,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":99,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":182,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":2.9466666666667,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
