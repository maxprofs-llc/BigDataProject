We prepared indium-111-labeled DTPA-G4\/PEI\/\u03b3-PGA, and evaluated the effectiveness as a nuclear imaging probe for sentinel lymph node (LN), the first LN that drains the primary tumor. (111)In-DTPA-G4\/PEI with strong cationic charge agglutinated with erythrocytes and showed extremely high cytotoxicity. By contrast, the anionic (111)In-DTPA-G4\/PEI\/\u03b3-PGA had little agglutination activity with erythrocytes and no cytotoxicity, indicating their high biocompatibility. (111)In-DTPA-G4\/PEI\/\u03b3-PGA was highly taken up by macrophage cells (high populations in LNs) comparable to (111)In-DTPA-G4\/PEI. The uptake mechanisms of (111)In-DTPA-G4\/PEI\/\u03b3-PGA were suggested to be both phagocytosis and \u03b3-PGA-specific pathway. Upon administration of each (111)In-labeled nano-platform into rat footpads intradermally, significantly higher radioactivity of (111)In-DTPA-G4\/PEI\/\u03b3-PGA was observed in the first draining popliteal LN when compared with that of (111)In-DTPA-G4\/PEI. Moreover, (111)In-DTPA-G4\/PEI\/\u03b3-PGA clearly visualized the sentinel LN with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) compared with (111)In-DTPA-G4\/PEI. Thus, (111)In-DTPA-G4\/PEI\/\u03b3-PGA can be useful as a nano-platform for molecular imaging including sentinel LN imaging.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d37","authors":["Sano K","Iwamiya Y","Kurosaki T","Ogawa M","Magata Y","Sasaki H","Ohshima T","Maeda M","Mukai T"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jconrel.2014.08.025","first_seen_on":"2014-09-22T13:41:00+00:00","issns":["01683659"],"journal":"Journal of Controlled Release","last_mentioned_on":1438769174,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0168365914006129","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25238958?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25238958","pubdate":"2014-09-17T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"title":"Radiolabeled \u03b3-polyglutamic acid complex as a nano-platform for sentinel lymph node imaging.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/radiolabeled-polyglutamic-acid-complex-nanoplatform-sentinel-lymph-node-imaging"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5446629,"mean":6.3432151099742,"rank":2894120,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1850476,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5446629,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143361,"mean":8.6763926618305,"rank":73813,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":53281,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143361,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2253,"mean":2.3531003552398,"rank":873,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":1243,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2253,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":6.4314666666667,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
