Many of these patients will also be taking aspirin and clopidogrel. Any of these medications alone can increase the risk of bleeding; however, the risk of bleeding in patients taking all 3 of these medications has not been studied. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records for bleeding complications in 182 patients, most with coronary artery disease (mean age 61 +\/- 11 years, 82% men) and being treated with high-dose fish oil (mean dose 3 +\/- 1.25 g), aspirin (mean dose 161 +\/- 115 mg), and clopidogrel (mean dose 75 mg), and in 182 age- and gender-matched controls treated with aspirin and clopidogrel alone. During a mean follow-up period of 33 months, 1 major bleeding episode occurred in the treatment group and no major bleeding episodes occurred in the control group (p = 1.0). During follow-up, 4 minor bleeding episodes (2.2%) occurred in the treatment group and 7 (3.9%) in the control group. More patients had minor bleeding complications in the control group than in the treatment group; however, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.5). In conclusion, high-dose fish oil is safe in combination with aspirin and clopidogrel and does not increase the risk of bleeding compared with that seen with aspirin and clopidogrel alone.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021f0","authors":["Watson PD","Joy PS","Nkonde C","Hessen SE","Karalis DG"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.amjcard.2009.05.055","first_seen_on":"2014-09-22T12:51:07+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"American Journal of Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1411401654,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19801023\/"],"pmid":"19801023","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Comparison of bleeding complications with omega-3 fatty acids + aspirin + clopidogrel--versus--aspirin + clopidogrel in patients with cardiovascular disease.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-bleeding-complications-omega3-fatty-acids-aspirin-clopidogrelversusaspirin-clopidogrel-pa-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4509149,"mean":5.2377591184699,"rank":3053317,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":883353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4509149,"percentile":19},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119058,"mean":8.419672325021,"rank":78746,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":25830,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119058,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2793,"mean":3.1812034383954,"rank":1643,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":809,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2793,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":3.4765454545455,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
