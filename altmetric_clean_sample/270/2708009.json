This investigation revealed that in the study area Cd concentration in soils was lower (mean value 0.158 mg kg(-1)) compared with other countries or regions. The Cd-contaminated areas are mainly located in west areas of the Pearl River Delta. Cd concentrations in all vegetables were lower than the national standard of Safe vegetables (0.2 mg kg(-1)). 88% of vegetable samples met the standard of No-Polluted vegetables (0.05 mg kg(-1)). The Cd concentration in vegetables was mainly influenced by the interactions of total Cd concentration in soils, soil pH and vegetable species. The fit lines of soil-to-plant transfer factors and total Cd concentration in soils for various vegetable species were best described by the exponential equation (y = ax(b)), and these fit lines can be divided into two parts, including the sharply decrease part with a large error range, and the slowly decrease part with a low error range, according to the gradual increasing of total Cd concentrations in soils.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Huihua Zhang","Junjian Chen","Li Zhu","Guoyi Yang","Dingqiang Li"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0108572","first_seen_on":"2014-09-23T18:28:10+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"9","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1425907800,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0108572","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0108572"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0108572.pdf","pmid":"25247431","pubdate":"2014-09-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e108572","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Transfer of Cadmium from Soil to Vegetable in the Pearl River Delta area, South China","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transfer-cadmium-soil-vegetable-pearl-river-delta-area-south-china"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.79,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.79},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8202376,"mean":6.9418947999756,"rank":1114092,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":7088325,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8202376,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193177,"mean":7.9051250258834,"rank":29829,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":163344,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193177,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113878,"mean":10.567789931242,"rank":22066,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":91815,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113878,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2824,"mean":17.363828551187,"rank":657,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":2167,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2824,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
