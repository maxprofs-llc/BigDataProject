An increasing case load and relative decrease in ophthalmologists predicted over the next few years portend of an upcoming bottleneck in care delivery. To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of patient care within a rapidly changing health system, we propose that minor adjustments to existing services could improve the proficiency of resources. Such changes will require service providers to rethink their positions and roles and actively collaborate with each other for improved patient outcomes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53d3cf058f610004756","authors":["Jamous KF","Kalloniatis M","Boon MY","Jalbert I","Zangerl B","Jamous, Khalid Fahad","Kalloniatis, Michael","Boon, Mei Ying","Jalbert, Isabelle","Zangerl, Barbara","Khalid Fahad Jamous","Michael Kalloniatis","Mei Ying Boon","Isabelle Jalbert","Barbara Zangerl"],"doi":"10.1111\/cxo.12194","endpage":"567","first_seen_on":"2014-09-22T20:18:34+00:00","issns":["1444-0938","0816-4622"],"issue":"6","journal":"Clinical & Experimental Optometry","last_mentioned_on":1411417091,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cxo.12194\/abstract;jsessionid=A2FBAAC6FF8AE144B063219ECAF1CA0E.f04t01"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cxo.12194\/pdf","pmid":"25243594","pubdate":"2014-09-21T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"565","subjects":["optometry"],"title":"The short\u2010sighted perspective of long\u2010term eye health\u2010care","type":"article","volume":"97","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/shortsighted-perspective-longterm-eye-healthcare"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6316593,"mean":5.9745296226198,"rank":4667397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":942317,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6316593,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155660,"mean":8.317391053521,"rank":104295,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":30894,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155660,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":222,"mean":1.677257918552,"rank":108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":79,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":222,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":0.53269230769231,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
