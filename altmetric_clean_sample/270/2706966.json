That study evaluated patients in five independent cohorts from various regions of the world. In an attempt to further validate the classifier, we have used a meta-analysis based approach to study 12 cohorts consisting of 1069 TNM stage I lung adenocarcinoma patients from every suitable, publically available dataset. Materials and Methods: Cohorts were obtained through a systematic search of public gene expression datasets. These data were used to calculate the risk score using the previously published 4-gene risk model. A fixed effects meta-analysis model was used to generate a pooled estimate for all cohorts. Results: The classifier was associated with prognosis in ten of the twelve cohorts (p<0.05). This association was highly consistent regardless of the ethnic diversity or microarray platform. The pooled estimate demonstrated that patients classified as high risk had worse overall survival for all stage I (Hazard Ratio [HR], 2.66; 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 1.93-3.67; P<0.0001) patients and in stratified analyses of stage IA (HR, 2.69; 95%CI, 1.66-4.35; P<0.0001) and stage IB (HR, 2.69; 95%CI, 1.74-4.16; P<0.0001) patients. Conclusions: The -4-gene classifier provides independent prognostic stratification of stage IA and stage IB patients beyond conventional clinical factors Impact: Our results suggest that the 4-gene classifier may assist clinicians in decisions regarding postoperative management of early stage lung adenocarcinoma patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dcc","authors":["Hirokazu Okayama","Aaron J Schetter","Teruhide Ishigame","Ana Robles","Takashi Kohno","Jun Yokota","Seiichi Takenoshita","Curtis C Harris","Okayama H","Schetter AJ","Ishigame T","Robles A","Kohno T","Yokota J","Takenoshita S","Harris CC"],"doi":"10.1158\/1055-9965.epi-14-0182","endpage":"2894","first_seen_on":"2014-09-23T13:19:41+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1538-7755","1055-9965"],"issue":"12","journal":"Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention","last_mentioned_on":1439389625,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25242053?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/cebp.aacrjournals.org\/content\/23\/12\/2884.short?rss=1","http:\/\/cebp.aacrjournals.org\/content\/23\/12\/2884.long","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25242053?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25242053?dopt=Abstract&utm_content=buffer13bbd&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmid":"25242053","pubdate":"2014-09-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"2884","subjects":["neoplasms","epidemiology","biochemistry"],"title":"The expression of four genes as a prognostic classifier for stage I lung adenocarcinoma in 12 independent cohorts.","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expression-four-genes-prognostic-classifier-stage-i-lung-adenocarcinoma-12-independent-cohorts"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5476876,"mean":6.3619433143891,"rank":2047176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":3410253,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5476876,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145151,"mean":8.6513766448504,"rank":46254,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":98095,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145151,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1751,"mean":10.921304,"rank":808,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":927,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1751,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":20.738273972603,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
