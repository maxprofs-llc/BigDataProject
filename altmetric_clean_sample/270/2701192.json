Both genes are expressed by type 1 astrocytes. The levels of the alpha 1-, alpha 2-, and beta 1-mRNAs did not significantly change between day 8 and day 22, in cultures grown in the absence of thyroid hormone. L-triiodothyronine (L-T3) treatment of the cultures increased the levels of beta 1-mRNAs by fivefold without changing either the levels of the alpha 1- and alpha 2-mRNAs or L-T3 binding capacity. The effect of L-T3 on beta 1-mRNAs was observed after 4 h of treatment and was independent of protein synthesis, suggesting that this effect is likely to be a direct one. Treatment of the cultures by cytosine arabinosine, a drug that kills dividing cells, specifically decreased level of the alpha 1- and alpha 2-mRNAs by 60% and 38%, respectively. Finally, by immunocytochemistry, we showed that the beta 1 receptor-immunoreactivity was either located in the perinuclear region and the cytoplasm or in the nuclei of astrocytes. Taken together with previous data obtained in neuronal cultures where no effect of L-T3 was observed on the levels of the beta 1-mRNAs, our findings indicate that the beta 1 gene is differentially regulated in neurons and astrocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f610007579","authors":["J M Lebel","S L'H\u00e9rault","J H Dussault","J Puymirat"],"doi":"10.1002\/glia.440090203","first_seen_on":"2014-09-21T12:15:54+00:00","issns":["0894-1491"],"issue":"2","journal":"Glia","last_mentioned_on":1411301634,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8244532"],"pmid":"8244532","pubdate":"1993-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Thyroid hormone up-regulates thyroid hormone receptor beta gene expression in rat cerebral hemisphere astrocyte cultures.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/thyroid-hormone-upregulates-thyroid-hormone-receptor-%CE%B2-gene-expression-rat-cerebral-hemisphere-astro"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4279702,"mean":5.0309399950838,"rank":3398634,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":123716,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4279702,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113511,"mean":8.1004809796497,"rank":89954,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":667,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113511,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":609,"mean":2.3112368421053,"rank":493,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":609,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":5.3142857142857,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
