Understanding and characterizing the dynamics of these water molecules require a surface-sensitive technique such as two-dimensional vibrational sum-frequency generation (2DSFG) spectroscopy. We have combined theoretical 2DSFG calculations with molecular dynamics simulations in order to investigate the dynamics of water near different lipid and surfactant monolayer surfaces. We show that 2DSFG can distinguish the dynamics of interfacial water as a function of the lipid charge and headgroup chemistry. The dynamics of water is slow compared to the bulk near water-zwitterionic and water-anionic interfaces due to conformational constraints on interfacial water imposed by strong phosphate-water hydrogen bonding. The dynamics of water is somewhat faster near water-cationic lipid interfaces as no such constraint is present. Using hydrogen bonding and rotational correlation functions, we characterize the dynamics of water as a function of the distance from the interface between water and zwitterionic lipids. We find that there is a transition from bulk-like to interface-like dynamics approximately 7 \u00c5 away from a zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine monolayer surface.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cee","authors":["S.
