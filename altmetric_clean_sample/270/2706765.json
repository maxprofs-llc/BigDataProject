Emerging reports also found the reduction of hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the patients and rodent models of AD, while the mechanism and functional significance remain debated. The present study aims to study the epigenetic mechanism underlying the BDNF reduction and its functional significance in the rats with hippocampal infusion of amyloid fibrils. In the rats injected with amyloid fibrils, significant decreases of BDNF expression and the mRNA of Bdnf exon VI werefound in the hippocampal CA1 area. Significantly increased hippocampal HDAC2expression and its occupancy in the promoter region of Bdnf exon VI were also observed, thus contributing to the histone H3 deacetylation and BDNF suppression in the hippocampal CA1 in the rats injected with amyloid fibrils. Inhibition of HDAC2 activity by trichostatin A substantially recovered the histone H3 acetylation in the promoter region of Bdnf exon VI and BDNF expression, thus mitigating the synaptic dysfunction and memory deficiency induced by amyloid fibrils. These results elucidate the epigenetic mechanism underlying the BDNF reduction induced by amyloid fibrils, and provided novel insights into the pathogenic mechanism of Alzheimer's disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032e3","authors":["Bei-Yun Wang","Yuan Zhong","Zhe Zhao","Ya Miao"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pbb.2014.09.009","first_seen_on":"2014-09-23T12:15:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-5177"],"journal":"Pharmacology, Biochemistry & Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1411474536,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25242807?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25242807","pubdate":"2014-09-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychopharmacology","behavioralsciences","pharmacology","biochemistry"],"title":"Epigenetic suppression of hippocampal BDNF mediates the memory deficiency induced by amyloid fibrils.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epigenetic-suppression-hippocampal-bdnf-mediates-memory-deficiency-induced-amyloid-fibrils"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4288018,"mean":5.0089731062087,"rank":3399445,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":123996,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4288018,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114645,"mean":8.0229663654445,"rank":90538,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":694,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114645,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1031,"mean":2.7807689320388,"rank":766,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":91,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1031,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":2.5,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
