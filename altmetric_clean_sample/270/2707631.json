(X. Lou)"],"citation":{"abstract":"Despite the great advantages of hollow structures as electrodes for lithium-ion batteries, one apparent common drawback which is often criticized is their compromised volumetric energy density due to the introduced hollow interior. Here, we design and synthesize bowl-like SnO2 @carbon hollow particles to reduce the excessive hollow interior space while retaining the general advantages of hollow structures. As a result, the tap density can be increased about 30\u2009%. The as-prepared bowl-like SnO2 @carbon hollow particles with conformal carbon support exhibit excellent lithium storage properties in terms of high capacity, stable cyclability and excellent rate capability.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Liang, Jin","Yu, Xin\u2010Yao","Zhou, Han","Wu, Hao Bin","Ding, Shujiang","Lou, Xiong Wen (David)"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201407917","endpage":"12807","first_seen_on":"2014-09-23T16:19:10+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3773","1433-7851"],"issue":"47","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
