The results indicated that the magnetic properties of the sediments were dominated by ferrimagnetic magnetite. The content of Fe, DCB- and AOD-extractable iron oxides correlated positively with the concentration of fine grained magnetite near the superparamagnetic\/stable single domain (SP\/SSD, approximately 0.03 microm) boundary, and with anti-ferromagnetic minerals (hematite\/goethite). The magnetic parameters for core SDK indicated a substantial decrease in magnetite concentration from a depth of approximately 20 cm toward the surface, together with a shift in the grain-size distribution of magnetic minerals toward the coarse end, suggesting selective dissolution of fine grained magnetite under reducing conditions. The reduction of iron oxides inferred from magnetic measurements was supported by the similar decrease in the concentration of Fe and Mn and a lower ratio of Mn\/Fe. Magnetic measurements on another core from elsewhere also indicated substantial reductive dissolution of iron oxides. In conjunction with the results of heavy metal analysis, it was suggested that the dissolution of iron oxides had a direct effect on the cycling of heavy metals. Therefore, magnetic measurements may provide useful information as to early diagenesis within intertidal sediments, which greatly influences the behavior of heavy metals in coastal environments.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100034e7","authors":["Zhang, W","Yu, L","Hutchinson, S M"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0048-9697(00)00735-x","first_seen_on":"2014-09-23T14:20:28+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["00489697","0048-9697"],"issue":"1-3","journal":"Science of the Total Environment","last_mentioned_on":1411481991,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S004896970000735X"],"pmid":"11258814","pubdate":"2001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Diagenesis of magnetic minerals in the intertidal sediments of the Yangtze Estuary, China, and its environmental significance ","type":"article","volume":"266","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diagenesis-magnetic-minerals-intertidal-sediments-yangtze-estuary-china-environmental-significance"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4288018,"mean":5.0089731062087,"rank":3399315,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":124002,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4288018,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114646,"mean":8.0221646299447,"rank":90491,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":680,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114646,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1875,"mean":3.7224599786553,"rank":1462,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1875,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":3.3250526315789,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
