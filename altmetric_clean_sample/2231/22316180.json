Neurobehavioral characterization of AS participants was completed via a battery of psychological testing and caregiver behavioral evaluations.\nEight of seventeen recruited AS participants completed the eye tracking paradigm. Compared to TDC, AS subjects demonstrated significantly less preference for social scenes than geometric shapes. Additionally, AS subjects showed less pupil dilation, compared to TDC, when viewing social scenes versus geometric shapes. There was no statistically significant difference found between AS and ASD subjects in either social eye tracking or pupillometry.\nThe use of eye tracking and pupillometry may represent an innovative measure for quantifying AS-associated impairments in social salience.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003464","authors":["Hong, Michael P.","Guilfoyle, Janna L.","Mooney, Lindsey N.","Wink, Logan K.","Pedapati, Ernest V.","Shaffer, Rebecca C.","Sweeney, John A.","Erickson, Craig A.","Michael P.
