Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promotes angiogenesis and contributes fibrous integration between tendon and bone during the early postoperative stage. Both MSCs and VEGF can stimulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and matrix deposition by enhancing angiogenesis and osteogenesis of the graft in the tunnel.\nInjection of intratunnel BM-MSCs and VEGF enhances the early healing process of a tendon graft.\nControlled laboratory study.\nIn this controlled animal laboratory study, each of 4 groups of rabbits underwent unilateral anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with use of the ipsilateral semitendinosus tendon. The rabbits received intratunnel injection of BM-MSCs and VEGF with a fibrin glue seal covering the distal tunnel at the articular site. Evaluation using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), collagen type III expression, and biomechanical analyses were performed at 3- and 6-week intervals.\nAll parameters using MRI, collagen type III expression, and biomechanical analysis of pullout strength of the graft showed that application of intratunnel BM-MSCs and VEGF enhanced tendon-to-bone healing after ACL reconstruction.\nIntratunnel injections of BM-MSCs and VEGF after ACL reconstruction enhanced graft tunnel healing. Overall, the femoral tunnel that received BM-MSCs and VEGF had better advanced healing with increased collagen type III fibers and better outcomes on MRI and biomechanical analysis. MRI is the most reliable tool for clinical use in evaluating stages of ACL healing after reconstruction, since biopsy is an invasive procedure.","altmetric_jid":"53aaba262a83ee523c8b4567","authors":["Setiawati, Rosy","Utomo, Dwikora Novembri","Rantam, Fedik Abdul","Ifran, Nadia Nastassia","Budhiparama, Nicolaas C."],"doi":"10.1177\/2325967117708548","first_seen_on":"2017-07-24T13:27:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2325-9671"],"issue":"6","journal":"Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1500902864,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28680888\/"],"pmcid":"PMC5482354","pmid":"28680888","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"SAGE Publications","title":"Early Graft Tunnel Healing After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction With Intratunnel Injection of Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/early-graft-tunnel-healing-after-anterior-cruciate-ligament-reconstruction-intratunnel-injection-bon"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8266541,"mean":6.9778542507441,"rank":6271801,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1117384,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8266541,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168906,"mean":11.498261555312,"rank":118791,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":31171,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168906,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":507,"mean":9.8265098814229,"rank":414,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":507,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":4.592,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ZDunkPT\/statuses\/889477196833751040","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22310428],"posted_on":"2017-07-24T13:27:44+00:00","author":{"name":"Zachary Dunkle","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/721715694358949888\/_Kx8ADno_normal.jpg","description":"Board Certified Orthopaedic Physical Therapist and Certified Physical Preparation Specialist who specializes in injury prevention and optimizing performance","id_on_source":"ZDunkPT","tweeter_id":"3060548343","geo":{"lt":33.749,"ln":-84.38798,"country":"US"},"followers":124},"tweet_id":"889477196833751040"}]}}
