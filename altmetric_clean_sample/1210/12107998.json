The subjects underwent pre-tested yoga-based lifestyle intervention including asanas, pranayama, relaxation techniques, lectures, group support, nutrition awareness program and individualized advice under supervision for approx. 2 hrs each day for 2 week followed by continuation of the practices at home for next 10 week. Outcome measures included cardio-metabolic risk factors: SBP, DBP, weight, BMI, waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), waist-hip ratio (WHR), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), serum lipid profile and adipocytokines (plasma leptin and adiponectin levels). These were assessed at baseline, after 2 weeks of intervention and at end of week 12.\nThe mean age of subjects was 40.3\u200a\u00b1\u200a5.5 yrs; mean BMI was 32.1\u200a\u00b1\u200a4.9\u200aKg\/m, SBP\/DBP was 135.5\u200a\u00b1\u200a13.2\/85.6\u200a\u00b1\u200a8.7 mmHg respectively. After intervention, there was significant reduction in weight, BMI, SBP, DBP, WC, HC, WHR, total cholesterol, and triglycerides (p\u200a<\u200a0.05) from baseline to week 12. Likewise, there was significant reduction in leptin from baseline to week 12, however changes in adiponectin were not statistically significant (Fig. 1). Further a strong significant positive correlation between the change in weight and the change in WC (r\u200a=\u200a0.9; p\u200a<\u200a0.01) & HC (r\u200a=\u200a0.7; p\u200a<\u200a0.01) followed by 12 weeks of intervention was seen.\nThese findings suggest that yoga-based lifestyle intervention might serve as an important treatment modality in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease through weight loss, reduction in blood pressure, cardio-metabolic risk factors and adipocytokines in subjects with pre- HTN or HTN.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a49","authors":["Yadav, Rashmi","Yadav, Raj Kumar","Khadgawat, Rajesh","Mehta, Nalin"],"doi":"10.1097\/01.hjh.0000500572.10167.f4","first_seen_on":"2016-09-20T22:29:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1473-5598","0263-6352"],"journal":"Journal of Hypertension","last_mentioned_on":1477082631,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27643078","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27643078","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27754148"],"pmid":"27643078","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"e252","title":"OS 28-06 BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF A 12-WEEK YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION ON CARDIO-METABOLIC RISK FACTORS AND ADIPOKINES IN SUBJECTS WITH PRE-HYPERTENSION OR HYPERTENSION","type":"article","volume":"34 Suppl 1 - ISH 2016 Abstract Book","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/os-2806-beneficial-effects-12week-yogabased-lifestyle-intervention-cardiometabolic-risk-factors-adip"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.1,"score_history":{"1y":3.1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7606948,"mean":6.5497577558997,"rank":1821944,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":5767241,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7606948,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243692,"mean":12.38870347284,"rank":80810,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":161870,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243692,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2431,"mean":2.4644403292181,"rank":294,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":2132,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2431,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":210,"mean":1.7544880382775,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":186,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":210,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Mathematics":1,"Arts and Humanities":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"SV":1,"ES":1,"GB":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RubenMurciaPrie\/statuses\/778360399611699201","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12107998],"posted_on":"2016-09-20T22:29:15+00:00","author":{"name":"Ruben Murcia Prieto","url":"http:\/\/rubendietetico.blogspot.com.es\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/868089428442591232\/fj2PtwG8_normal.jpg","description":"Buscador de verdades.
