However, it is not known whether periodontitis and bad oral health behavior could influence on the CVD risk. This study aimed to examine whether periodontitis and bad oral health behavior predict 10-year general CVD risk using representative national data.\nUsing data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) in 2013, we selected men and women who were aged over 30 years and who had no previous CVD history (n\u200a=\u200a4259). The data were analyzed using a complex, stratified, and multistage probability cluster sampling approach.\nAn average age of population was 53.6\u200a\u00b1\u200a14.6 years. CVD risk was estimated using Framingham General CVD score including age, gender, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, smoking and diabetes. Oral health behavior score were measured by sum of daily tooth brushing frequency, use of dental floss, and experience of scaling.\nAn average Framingham risk score for 10-year general CVD event was 12.8\u200a\u00b1\u200a10.0 points (Range -2\u223c50) and CVD risks are 8.9\u200a\u00b1\u200a8.2% (Range 0-31). The 16.6% (n\u200a=\u200a707) of the population had a high global CVD risk\u200a>\u200a20%, and 20.9% (n\u200a=\u200a888) and 62.5% (n\u200a=\u200a2,664) were included in the intermediate (10-20%) and low risk group (<10%), respectively. The 31.6% (n\u200a=\u200a1,344) had an experience of periodontal disease. Bivariate analyses showed that having periodontal disease and bad oral health behavior significantly associated with higher CVD risk scores. Logistic regression analyses showed that, when age and gender adjusted for, those who had an experience of periodontal disease were 1.48 times more chance to have intermediate CVD risk (OR 1.48, 95%CI:1.12-1.95) and 1.98 times more chance to have high CVD risk (OR 1.98, 95%CI: 1.50-2.68) compared to low CVD risk group.\nEducation on periodontitis management and oral hygiene behavior should be included when we establish strategy for the public at risk for CVD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a49","authors":["Hwang, Seon Young","Shim, Jae Lan"],"doi":"10.1097\/01.hjh.0000500579.48285.b3","first_seen_on":"2016-09-20T22:26:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1473-5598","0263-6352"],"journal":"Journal of Hypertension","last_mentioned_on":1474410396,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27643085"],"pmid":"27643085","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"e255","title":"OS 30-01 ASSOCIATION OF ORAL HEALTH WITH 10-YEAR GENERAL CARDIOVASCULAR RISK","type":"article","volume":"34 Suppl 1 - ISH 2016 Abstract Book","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/os-3001-association-oral-health-10year-general-cardiovascular-risk-korean-national-health-nutrition"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":7267902,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253630,"mean":12.666106210252,"rank":209562,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253630,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2745,"mean":2.5813462099125,"rank":2486,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2745,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":215,"mean":1.758214953271,"rank":130,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":215,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RubenMurciaPrie\/statuses\/778359734244114433","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12107971],"posted_on":"2016-09-20T22:26:36+00:00","author":{"name":"Ruben Murcia Prieto","url":"http:\/\/rubendietetico.blogspot.com.es\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/868089428442591232\/fj2PtwG8_normal.jpg","description":"Buscador de verdades.
