Acute VBDS is a rare disease with unknown aetiology, often presenting with progressive loss of the intrahepatic biliary tract. TEN is an immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity reaction involving the skin and mucosa, which is induced by drugs or infectious diseases, sometimes leading to systemic symptoms. The patient in this case report was treated with supportive care, a steroid and ursodeoxycholic acid, with complete recovery observed by the end of the 8th month. This case report suggests that ibuprofen can cause acute vanishing duct syndrome.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006abf","authors":["Basturk, Ahmet","Artan, Reha","Y\u0131lmaz, Aygen","Gelen, Mustafa T","Duman, Ozgur"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ajg.2016.08.006","first_seen_on":"2016-09-20T20:12:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["16871979","2090-2387"],"issue":"3","journal":"Arab Journal of Gastroenterology","last_mentioned_on":1485001468,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1687197916300582"],"pmid":"27658326","pubdate":"2016-09-24T22:09:57+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Acute vanishing bile duct syndrome after the use of ibuprofen","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/acute-vanishing-bile-duct-syndrome-after-ibuprofen"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8085102,"mean":6.8782317593723,"rank":4275046,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2244225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8085102,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249393,"mean":12.631249847629,"rank":138467,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":86187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249393,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167,"mean":1.4765662650602,"rank":76,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.3,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"EG":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ArabJGastro\/statuses\/778325860671709185","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12106806],"posted_on":"2016-09-20T20:12:00+00:00","author":{"name":"Arab J Gastroenterol","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/421724276723445760\/xwp2SNzQ_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"ArabJGastro","tweeter_id":"2285475252","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":291},"tweet_id":"778325860671709185"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/abdmeguidkassem\/statuses\/778326130092802048","license":"gnip","rt":["ArabJGastro"],"citation_ids":[12106806],"posted_on":"2016-09-20T20:13:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Abdel Meguid Kassem","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1258483440\/egypt-flag_normal.gif","description":"Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University","id_on_source":"abdmeguidkassem","tweeter_id":"147431174","geo":{"lt":30.06263,"ln":31.24967,"country":"EG"},"followers":819},"tweet_id":"778326130092802048"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ArabJGastro\/statuses\/822739093549359105","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12106806],"posted_on":"2017-01-21T09:34:20+00:00","author":{"name":"Arab J Gastroenterol","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/421724276723445760\/xwp2SNzQ_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"ArabJGastro","tweeter_id":"2285475252","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":291},"tweet_id":"822739093549359105"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/abdmeguidkassem\/statuses\/822781911630225408","license":"gnip","rt":["ArabJGastro"],"citation_ids":[12106806],"posted_on":"2017-01-21T12:24:28+00:00","author":{"name":"Abdel Meguid Kassem","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1258483440\/egypt-flag_normal.gif","description":"Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University","id_on_source":"abdmeguidkassem","tweeter_id":"147431174","geo":{"lt":30.06263,"ln":31.24967,"country":"EG"},"followers":819},"tweet_id":"822781911630225408"}]}}
