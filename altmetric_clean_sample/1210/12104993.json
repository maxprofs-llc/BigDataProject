Kinetic parameters such as growth rate and substrate utilization rate were determined using a pure culture of two isolated strains. The degration rate by a mixed culture of two isolated strains was higher than that by single strain only. Also, the effect of polymerization degree on biodegradation was negligible but initial PVA concentration was very sensitive on biodegradation. 42% of PVA and 55% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) in textile wastewater was removed by a mixed culture of two isolated strains after 5 days.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d63cf058f61000114d","authors":["Chung, Jinwook","Kim, Seungjin","Choi, Kwangkeun","Kim, Jong-Oh"],"doi":"10.1080\/09593330.2015.1054257","endpage":"458","first_seen_on":"2016-09-20T17:10:27+00:00","issns":["0959-3330","1479-487X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Environmental Technology","last_mentioned_on":1474391419,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1080\/09593330.2015.1054257"],"pmid":"26000781","pubdate":"2015-05-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"452","subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"\n              Degradation of polyvinyl alcohol in textile waste water by\n              Microbacterium barkeri\n              KCCM 10507 and\n              Paenibacillus amylolyticus\n              KCCM 10508\n            ","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/polyvinyl-alcohol-degradation-microbacterium-barkeri-kccm-10507-paenibacillus-amylolyticus-kccm-1050"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":2159291,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5101355,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253631,"mean":12.666149911288,"rank":86350,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":163238,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253631,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":404,"mean":1.905429280397,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":294,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":404,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":3.9,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Ph.
