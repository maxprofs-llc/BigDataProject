Materials and Methods\u2003From 1996 to 2011, 10 patients with unilateral DP and 6 patients with TDH underwent elective surgery. Preoperative and long-term (12 months) follow-up assessments were completed in all patients, including pulmonary function tests (PFTs) with diffusion of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), measure of maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) assessed both in standing and in supine positions, blood gas analysis, chest computed tomographic (CT) scan, and dyspnea score. The Pearson chi-square test, Fisher exact test, and Student t-test were applied when indicated. Results\u2003At long-term (12 months) postoperative follow-up, patients operated for DP showed a significant improvement in terms of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1%) (+ 18.2%, p\u2009<\u20090.001), forced vital capacity (FVC%) (+ 12.8%, p\u2009<\u20090.001), DLCO% (+ 8.3%, p\u2009=\u20090.04), and Po 2 (+ 9.86\u2009mm Hg, p\u2009<\u20090.001) when compared with baseline values. Conversely, when considering the TDH group, only the levels of Po 2 were found to be significantly higher in the postoperative assessment (+ 8.3\u2009mm Hg, p\u2009=\u20090.04). Although MIP increased in both the groups after surgery, a persistent and significant decrease of MIP was detected in TDH group when comparing the levels assessed in supine position with those measured in the standing position (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Medical Research Council dyspnea scale improved in the DP group by a factor of 0.80 (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and in the TDH group by a factor of 0.33 (p\u2009=\u20090.175). Conclusion\u2003In patients who underwent surgery for DP, good long-term results may be predicted in terms of pulmonary flows, volumes, and DLCO. Conversely, in patients who underwent elective surgery for chronic TDH, a persistent overall restrictive pattern, lower MIP values in supine position, and paradoxical motion could be expected.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003663","authors":["Cristian Rapicetta","Luca Voltolini","Filippo Lococo","Ilaria Vecchioni","Sara Tenconi","Masimiliano Paci","Tommaso Ricchetti","Marcello Rossi","Giuseppe Gotti"],"doi":"10.1055\/s-0035-1547450","first_seen_on":"2017-07-18T18:00:34+00:00","issns":["0171-6425","1439-1902"],"journal":"Thoracic & Cardiovascular Surgeon","last_mentioned_on":1500390545,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25826679?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25826679","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","cardiology","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Time-Trend Analysis of Pulmonary and Diaphragmatic Functionality in Patients with Diaphragmatic Palsy or with Chronic Diaphragmatic Hernia after Surgical Treatment","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/timetrend-analysis-pulmonary-diaphragmatic-functionality-patients-diaphragmatic-palsy-chronic-diaphr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8229472,"mean":6.9710874477773,"rank":7121616,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8229472,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163881,"mean":11.676121698804,"rank":134001,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163881,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":154,"mean":1.3002483660131,"rank":96,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":154,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.75,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
