The extracellular protozoan parasites are exemplars of antigenic variation. They direct host protective B cell and T cell immune responses towards hypervariable components of their variable surface glycoprotein coat, and evade immune elimination by generating new surface coat antigenic variants at a rate that supersedes immune destruction. This results in recurring waves of parasitemia, tissue invasion and escalating immunopathology in trypanosomiasis-susceptible hosts. Here we discuss the possibility that host control of African trypanosomes might be improved by immunization with conserved VSG peptides and invariant surface glycoproteins. Infection-induced T cell recall responses to these typically poorly expressed or non-immunogenic parasite components induce tissue phagocytes to produce microbicidal materials that kill trypanosomes. Preliminary data that support this immune-enhancing vaccine strategy are discussed, as are host and parasite interactions that might down-regulate the protective responses. These include infection-induced immunosuppression and increasing virulence of infecting parasites over time. This article is protected by copyright.
