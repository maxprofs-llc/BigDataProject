We wished to determine whether anemia or macrocytosis predict hypofolatemia, low B12, or refractoriness to antidepressants.\nAfter obtaining serum folate, B12, and hematological indices, 213 depressed adults were treated with fluoxetine 20 mg\/day. Amelioration of depressive symptoms was measured.\nNeither macrocytosis nor anemia predicted low serum folate\/B12, or antidepressant refractoriness. Among 39 patients with hypofolatemia, none had macrocytosis; 28% had low HCT; 41% had low RBC. Among 25 patients with low B12, none had macrocytosis; 24% had low HCT; 28% had low RBC. Among non-responders, 3% had macrocytosis; 24% had low HCT; 25% had low RBC.\nAnemia and macrocytosis should not be used to predict folate or B12 deficiencies, or refractoriness to antidepressants. Measurement of folate and B12 should be considered when evaluating treatment refractoriness.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002eec","authors":["David Mischoulon","Jane K Burger","Maya K Spillmann","John J Worthington","Maurizio Fava","Jonathan E Alpert"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0022-3999(00)00158-6","endpage":"187","first_seen_on":"2016-09-18T05:04:32+00:00","issns":["0022-3999"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Psychosomatic Research","last_mentioned_on":1474193386,"links":["https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/12217125_Anemia_and_macrocytosis_in_the_prediction_of_serum_folate_and_vitamin_B12_status_and_treatment_outcome_in_major_depression"],"pmid":"11110989","pubdate":"2000-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"183","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Anemia and macrocytosis in the prediction of serum folate and vitamin B12 status, and treatment outcome in major depression","type":"article","volume":"49","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/anemia-macrocytosis-prediction-serum-folate-vitamin-b12-status-treatment-outcome-major-depression"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8396916,"mean":7.0724322720827,"rank":7258131,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8396916,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254180,"mean":12.672372186529,"rank":210379,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254180,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1406,"mean":6.2739416370107,"rank":1294,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1406,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":3.9144444444444,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
