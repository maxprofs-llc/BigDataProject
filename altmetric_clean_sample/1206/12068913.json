The aim of this study was to develop a tissue engineered mitral valve scaffold possessing appropriate composition and structure to ensure ideal characteristics of mitral valves, such as large orifice, rapid opening and closure, maintenance of mitral annulus - papillary muscle continuity, in vivo biocompatibility and extended durability. An extracellular matrix-based scaffold was generated, based on the native porcine mitral valve as starting material and a technique for porcine cell removal without causing damage to the matrix components. In order to stabilize these structures and slow down their degradation, acellular scaffolds were treated with penta-galloyl glucose (PGG), a well-characterized polyphenol with high affinity for collagen and elastin. Biaxial mechanical testing presented similar characteristics for the PGG-treated scaffolds compared to fresh tissues. The extracellular matrix components, crucial for maintaining the valve shape and function, were well preserved in leaflets, as well as in chordae, as shown by their resistance to collagenase and elastin. When extracted with strong detergents, the PGG-treated scaffolds released a reduced amount of soluble matrix peptides, compared to untreated scaffolds; this correlated with diminished activation of fibroblasts seeded on scaffolds treated with PGG. Cell-seeded scaffolds conditioned for 5 weeks in a valve bioreactor showed good cell viability. Finally, rat subdermal implantation studies showed that PGG-treated mitral valve scaffolds were biocompatible, non-immunogenic, non-inflammatory and non-calcifying. In conclusion, a biocompatible mitral valve scaffold was developed, that preserved the biochemical composition and structural integrity of the valve, essential for its highly dynamic mechanical demands, as well as its biologic durability.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008b9b","authors":["Mr. Christopher  Deborde"],"doi":"10.1089\/ten.tea.2016.0032","first_seen_on":"2016-09-18T05:35:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1937-335X","1937-3341"],"journal":"Tissue Engineering: Part A","last_mentioned_on":1474176906,"links":["http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/10.1089\/ten.TEA.2016.0032"],"pmid":"27608885","pubdate":"2016-09-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["histology","biotechnology"],"title":"Stabilized collagen and elastin-based scaffolds for mitral valve tissue engineering","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/stabilized-collagen-elastinbased-scaffolds-mitral-valve-tissue-engineering"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8396916,"mean":7.0724322720827,"rank":7258142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8396916,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254179,"mean":12.672466499854,"rank":210391,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254179,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":857,"mean":3.3851845794393,"rank":750,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":857,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":6.82,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
