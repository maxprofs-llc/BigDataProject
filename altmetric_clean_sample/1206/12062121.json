Application of a local vibration intervention may be a modality to reduce the consequences of fatigue and soreness.\nTo examine the effects of a local vibration intervention following a bout of exercise on balance, power, and self-reported pain.\nSingle-blind, crossover study.\nLaboratory.\nNineteen healthy, moderately active subjects completed the study.\nFollowing a 30-minute bout of full-body exercise, subjects received either an active or a sham vibration intervention. The active vibration intervention was performed bilaterally over the muscle bellies of the triceps surae, quadriceps, hamstrings, and gluteals. At least a week later, subjects repeated the study, receiving the other vibration intervention.\nStatic balance, dynamic balance, power, and self-reported pain were measured at baseline, following the vibration intervention, and 24-hours post exercise.\nFollowing the bout of exercise, subjects had reduced static balance, dynamic balance, and increased self-reported pain regardless of vibration intervention. There were no differences between outcome measures between the active vibration and the sham vibration conditions.\nOur local vibration intervention did not affect balance, power, or self-reported pain.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f37","authors":["Chinn, Lisa","Peer, Kimberly S","Miller, Lauren"],"doi":"10.1123\/jsr.2015-0125","endpage":"22","first_seen_on":"2016-09-17T12:58:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1543-3072","1056-6716"],"journal":"Journal of Sport Rehabilitation","last_mentioned_on":1474117117,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27632847?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27632847","pubdate":"2016-08-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine","sportsmedicine"],"title":"The Effects of Local Vibration on Balance, Power, and Self-Reported Pain Following Exercise","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-local-vibration-balance-power-selfreported-pain-following-exercise"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8392157,"mean":7.0686031077041,"rank":6368828,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1138021,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8392157,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254024,"mean":12.651793333674,"rank":179065,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":43616,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254024,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300,"mean":5.3621471571906,"rank":237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":3.5442105263158,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"VE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OMTVenezuela\/statuses\/777129634282414080","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12062121],"posted_on":"2016-09-17T12:58:37+00:00","author":{"name":"OMT Venezuela","url":"http:\/\/www.terapiamanual.com.ve","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3357508130\/7490ea3137e7b05c0726d0d0d0940a2a_normal.jpeg","description":"Fisioterapia Manual-Manipulativa Ortop\u00e9dica Venezuela promueve la formaci\u00f3n del fisioterapeuta o terapeuta f\u00edsico","id_on_source":"OMTVenezuela","tweeter_id":"570778564","geo":{"lt":10.48801,"ln":-66.87919,"country":"VE"},"followers":419},"tweet_id":"777129634282414080"}]}}
