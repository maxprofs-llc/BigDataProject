Strategies for their prevention and treatment have been organized in pharmacological and nonpharmacological measures. Acupuncture at PC6 has demonstrated efficacy in randomized trials, although evidence regarding its efficacy in treating IONV and PONV has not yet been fully established. We present the case of a patient who underwent peripheral vascular surgery on a limb under a subarachnoid block and who developed IONV refractory to conventional pharmacological therapy. Acupuncture at the PC6 and the TF4 points proved to be an effective alternative treatment to conventional pharmacological treatment and resulted in almost immediate cessation of IONV.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b3c","authors":["Gouveia, Francisco","Oliveira, Carmen","Losa, Nuno","Francisco Gouveia","Carmen Oliveira","Nuno Losa"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jams.2016.09.005","endpage":"329","first_seen_on":"2016-09-18T00:03:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["20052901","2093-8152"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Acupuncture and Meridian Studies","last_mentioned_on":1484855957,"links":["http:\/\/www.jams-kpi.com\/article\/S2005-2901(16)30156-X\/fulltext?rss=yes","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28010836","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jams.2016.09.005"],"pmid":"28010836","pubdate":"2016-12-25T22:04:28+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"325","subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"Acupuncture in the Management of Intraoperative Nausea and Vomiting: A Case Report","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S200529011630156X","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/acupuncture-management-intraoperative-nausea-vomiting"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8083930,"mean":6.8667526310456,"rank":3473453,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4495792,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8083930,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249978,"mean":12.640901642951,"rank":104365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":141173,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249978,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":220,"mean":3.217296803653,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":220,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":2.1928571428571,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Business, Management and Accounting":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SPAHerbal\/statuses\/777296828052234240","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12066639],"posted_on":"2016-09-18T00:02:59+00:00","author":{"name":"C.A.I.
