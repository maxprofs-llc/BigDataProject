Patients followed dosing regimens based on age, weight, and indication, with adjustments permitted. Treatment duration was 6-12 weeks for IA patients, \u226514 days after last positive Candida culture for IC patients, and \u22657 days after signs\/symptoms resolution for EC patients. Primary analysis for both studies was safety and tolerability of voriconazole. Secondary endpoints included global response success at Week 6 and end of treatment (EOT), all-causality mortality, and time to death. Voriconazole exposure-response relationship was explored.\nOf 53 voriconazole-treated pediatric patients (31 IA; 22 IC\/EC), 14 had proven\/probable IA, 7 had confirmed IC, and 10 had confirmed EC. Treatment-related hepatic and visual adverse events (AEs), respectively, were reported in 22.6% and 16.1% of IA patients, and 22.7% and 27.3% of IC\/EC patients. All-causality mortality in IA patients was 14.3% at Week 6; no deaths were attributed to voriconazole. No deaths were reported for IC\/EC patients. Global response success rate was 64.3% (Week 6 and EOT) in IA patients and 76.5% (EOT) in IC\/EC patients. There was no association between voriconazole exposure and efficacy; however, a slight positive association between voriconazole exposure and hepatic AEs was established.\nSafety and efficacy outcomes in pediatric patients with IA and IC\/EC were consistent with previous findings in adult patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008487","authors":["Martin, Judith M.","Macias-Parra, Mercedes","Mudry, Peter","Conte, Umberto","Yan, Jean L.","Liu, Ping","Capparella, M.
