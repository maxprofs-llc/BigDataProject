Forty-five male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided (n = 15 per group) into a sham group, control group (pretreatment with Lactated Ringer's solution), or PolyPHb group (pretreatment with 0.1 gHb\/kg PolyPHb). Rat hearts were subjected to 30-min ischemia by occlusion of left anterior descending, followed by 2-hr reperfusion. As compared to the control group, PolyPHb preserved cardiac function and reduced cardiac troponin-I release and histopathological changes. Therefore, PolyPHb pretreatment provided a profound cardioprotective effect on the in vivo rat heart.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51b3cf058f610003941","authors":["Tao Li","Ronghua Zhou","Xujin Xiang","Da Zhu","Yanyan Li","Jin Liu","Wei Wu","Chengmin Yang"],"doi":"10.3109\/10731199.2011.611472","endpage":"397","first_seen_on":"2011-11-10T11:30:11+00:00","issns":["1073-1199","1532-4184"],"issue":"6","journal":"Artificial Cells, Blood Substitutes, & Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1320899437,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/10731199.2011.611472?ai=1lo8&mi=3e34ke&af=R&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=ABB"],"pmid":"22066796","pubdate":"2011-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"392","subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Polymerized human placenta hemoglobin given before ischemia protects rat heart from ischemia reperfusion injury.","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/polymerized-human-placenta-hemoglobin-given-before-ischemia-protects-rat-heart-ischemia-reperfusion"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630565,"mean":4.929464153233,"rank":2899465,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":79603,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630565,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71020,"mean":3.7835851532688,"rank":48259,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":429,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71020,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":0.93806818181818,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":0.26923076923077,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
