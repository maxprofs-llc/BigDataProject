However, street-based workers form the minority of sex workers in Canada. Can their experiences validly be generalized to other types of prostitution? The research presented in this article examines whether female off-street sex workers face the same degree of victimization as female street-based sex workers in Vancouver, British Columbia. The results of a victimization survey examining interpersonal violence and other forms of victimization indicate that although violence and exploitation do occur in the off-street industry, some women sell sex without experiencing violence.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4db3cf058f6100017f8","authors":["Tamara O'Doherty"],"doi":"10.1177\/1077801211412917","endpage":"963","first_seen_on":"2011-11-05T19:08:19+00:00","issns":["1552-8448"],"issue":"7","journal":"Violence Against Women","last_mentioned_on":1320518338,"links":["http:\/\/vaw.sagepub.com\/content\/17\/7\/944.short?rss=1&ssource=mfr"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/vaw.sagepub.com\/content\/17\/7\/944.full.pdf","pmid":"21665856","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Studies In Human Society","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Law And Legal Studies","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences"],"startpage":"944","title":"Victimization in Off-Street Sex Industry Work","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/victimization-offstreet-sex-industry-work"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":2671265,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1694427,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74995,"mean":4.5315651652132,"rank":32487,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":28476,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74995,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":463,"mean":4.9521471861472,"rank":303,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":80,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":463,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":4.306,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":3,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
