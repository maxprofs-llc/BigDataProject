In this study, we investigated the role of O(2)(-) and NO in the induction of TNF\u03b1 in microglia. The LPS-inducible TNF\u03b1 was significantly suppressed by pretreatment with the O(2)(-) scavenger N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), but not by the NO scavenger 2-(4-Carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl imidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide, suggesting the close association of O(2)(-) with TNF\u03b1 induction. NAC strongly depressed phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), which is necessary for inducing TNF\u03b1 in microglia. On the other hand, an O(2)(-) donor, 3-(4-Morpholinyl)sydnonimine (SIN-1), induced TNF\u03b1 in microglia, and the effects of SIN-1 were completely abolished in the presence of superoxide dismutase. There is little likelihood that the NO produced in SIN-1 degradation induces TNF\u03b1 in microglia, because TNF\u03b1 was not induced in microglia exposed to the NO-donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine. Moreover, the addition of SIN-1 to microglia resulted in activation of p38 MAPK and its upstream kinase MKK3\/6. Taken together, these results showed that O(2)(-) is an important signaling molecule for activating the MKK3\/6-p38 cascade, which is requisite for inducing TNF\u03b1 in microglia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002427","doi":"10.1016\/j.brainres.2011.09.009","first_seen_on":"2011-11-05T12:04:52+00:00","issns":["1872-6240"],"journal":"Brain Research","last_mentioned_on":1320502266,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21981804?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21981804","pubdate":"2011-11-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["brain"],"title":"Superoxide anion contributes to the induction of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) through activation of the MKK3\/6-p38 MAPK cascade in rat microglia.","type":"article","volume":"1422","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/superoxide-anion-contributes-induction-tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-tnf%CE%B1-through-activation-mkk36p38"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":2082372,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":2872574,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74958,"mean":4.5147792734501,"rank":22752,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":50330,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74958,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2605,"mean":3.2507603686636,"rank":1316,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":1247,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2605,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":5.3267272727273,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
