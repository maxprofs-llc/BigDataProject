The purposes of this article were to review currently available CBV measurement techniques and perform a meta-analysis using values from many small-scale studies that calculated CBV values for normal healthy children. A literature review demonstrated numerous methods by which to determine CBV. However, these methods necessitate repetitive blood sampling, require the introduction of foreign substances into the bloodstream, or address the uncertainty of substance distribution and clearance. Many small-scale studies have calculated CBV values for normal healthy children, and we performed a meta-analysis using these values. Age groups were defined, and within each group, means +\/- 1 and 2 standard deviations were compared. A pooled estimate of mean blood volume and a 95% confidence interval was calculated after Q-statistics calculations indicated that the groups were homogeneous. Mean values showed agreement with typically accepted normal values. A large-scale study should be repeated when a gold standard for CBV measurements is developed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006b3a","doi":"10.1097\/mat.0b013e3181d0c28d","first_seen_on":"2011-11-08T23:26:06+00:00","issns":["1058-2916"],"issue":"3","journal":"ASAIO Journal: A Peer-Reviewed Journal of the American Society for Artificial Internal Organs","last_mentioned_on":1320793418,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/asaiojournal\/Abstract\/2010\/05000\/Circulating_Blood_Volumes__A_Review_of_Measurement.19.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/asaiojournal\/2010\/05000\/Circulating_Blood_Volumes__A_Review_of_Measurement.19.pdf","pmid":"20335800","pubdate":"2009-12-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Materials Science","Engineering","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Medicine","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"260","title":"Circulating Blood Volumes: A Review of Measurement Techniques and a Meta-Analysis in Children","type":"article","volume":"56","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/circulating-blood-volumes-review-measurement-techniques-metaanalysis-children"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":3108063,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":983398,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73581,"mean":4.1066556944822,"rank":44549,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":17746,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73581,"percentile":24},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":414,"mean":1.1516949152542,"rank":178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":59,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":414,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":0.73529411764706,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
