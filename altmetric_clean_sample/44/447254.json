However, one of the limitations of PDT is treatment-induced hypoxia that triggers angiogenesis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of combination therapy with PDT and an antiangiogenic protocol using monoclonal antibodies against both vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007fef","doi":"10.1002\/lsm.21109","first_seen_on":"2011-11-08T22:07:56+00:00","issns":["1096-9101"],"issue":"7","journal":"Lasers in Surgery and Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1320786157,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22057493?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22057493","pubdate":"2011-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine","generalsurgery"],"title":"Antiangiogenesis agents avastin and erbitux enhance the efficacy of photodynamic therapy in a murine bladder tumor model.","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antiangiogenesis-agents-avastin-erbitux-enhance-efficacy-photodynamic-therapy-murine-bladder-tumor-m"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":4206768,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75587,"mean":4.5285490170137,"rank":62353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75587,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":389,"mean":2.9116494845361,"rank":322,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":389,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":0.96153846153846,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
