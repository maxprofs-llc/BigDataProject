Here we show that a small inversion within chromosome 2p results in the formation of a fusion gene comprising portions of the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) gene and the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Mouse 3T3 fibroblasts forced to express this human fusion tyrosine kinase generated transformed foci in culture and subcutaneous tumours in nude mice. The EML4-ALK fusion transcript was detected in 6.7% (5 out of 75) of NSCLC patients examined; these individuals were distinct from those harbouring mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene. Our data demonstrate that a subset of NSCLC patients may express a transforming fusion kinase that is a promising candidate for a therapeutic target as well as for a diagnostic molecular marker in NSCLC.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2007Natur.448..561S","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003160","authors":["Soda, Manabu","Choi, Young Lim","Enomoto, Munehiro","Takada, Shuji","Yamashita, Yoshihiro","Ishikawa, Shunpei","Fujiwara, Shin-ichiro","Watanabe, Hideki","Kurashina, Kentaro","Hatanaka, Hisashi","Bando, Masashi","Ohno, Shoji","Ishikawa, Yuichi","Aburatani, Hiroyuki","Niki, Toshiro","Sohara, Yasunori","Sugiyama, Yukihiko","Mano, Hiroyuki","Manabu Soda","Young Lim Choi","Munehiro Enomoto","Shuji Takada","Yoshihiro Yamashita","Shunpei Ishikawa","Shin-ichiro Fujiwara","Hideki Watanabe","Kentaro Kurashina","Hisashi Hatanaka","Masashi Bando","Shoji Ohno","Yuichi Ishikawa","Hiroyuki Aburatani","Toshiro Niki","Yasunori Sohara","Yukihiko Sugiyama","Hiroyuki Mano"],"doi":"10.1038\/nature05945","endpage":"566","first_seen_on":"2011-11-03T22:41:43+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1476-4687","0028-0836"],"issue":"7153","journal":"Nature","last_mentioned_on":1464825600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17625570","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nature\/journal\/v448\/n7153\/full\/nature05945.html","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/nature05945"],"pmid":"17625570","pubdate":"2007-08-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"561","subjects":["science"],"title":"Identification of the transforming EML4-ALK fusion gene in non-small-cell lung cancer.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/nature05945","volume":"448","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-transforming-eml4alk-fusion-gene-nonsmallcell-lung-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":60.284,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":60.284},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8041560,"mean":6.832772947133,"rank":142472,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":7899567,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8041560,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88302,"mean":5.1439214504932,"rank":995,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":87306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88302,"percentile":98},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47093,"mean":73.411265352926,"rank":11003,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":36089,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47093,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":896,"mean":50.585036871508,"rank":218,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":677,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":896,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":9,"Professor > Associate Professor":38,"Researcher":194,"Student  > Doctoral Student":33,"Student  > Ph.
