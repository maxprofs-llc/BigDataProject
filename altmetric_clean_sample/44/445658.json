However, the conditions under which passive endocytosis (i.e., not ATP driven) takes place are not well understood. We report MD simulations of the passive uptake of ligand-coated nanoparticles with varying size, shape, coverage, and membrane-binding strength. We find that the efficiency of passive endocytosis is higher for spherocylindrical particles than for spheres and that endocytosis is suppressed for particles with sharp edges.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2011NanoL..11.5391V","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003145","authors":["Robert V\u00e1cha","Francisco J.
