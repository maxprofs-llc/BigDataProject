Among them, HCMV uses cellular captured genes encoding molecules capable of interfering with the original host function or of fulfilling new immunomodulatory tasks. Here, we report on UL7, a novel HCMV heavily glycosylated transmembrane protein, containing an Ig-like domain that exhibits remarkable amino acid similarity to CD229, a cell-surface molecule of the signalling lymphocyte-activation molecule (SLAM) family involved in leukocyte activation. The UL7 Ig-like domain, which is well-preserved in all HCMV strains, structurally resembles the SLAM-family N-terminal Ig-variable domain responsible for the homophilic and heterophilic interactions that trigger signalling. UL7 is transcribed with early-late kinetics during the lytic infectious cycle. Using a mAb generated against the viral protein, we show that it is constitutively shed, through its mucine-like stalk, from the cell-surface. Production of soluble UL7 is enhanced by PMA and reduced by a broad-spectrum metalloproteinase inhibitor. Although UL7 does not hold the ability to interact with CD229 or other SLAM-family members, it shares with them the capacity to mediate adhesion to leukocytes, specifically to monocyte-derived DCs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that UL7 expression attenuates the production of proinflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-8 and IL-6 in DCs and myeloid cell lines. Thus, the ability of UL7 to interfere with cellular proinflammatory responses may contribute to viral persistence. These results enhance our understanding of those HCMV-encoded molecules involved in sustaining the balance between HCMV and the host immune system.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a9a","authors":["Engel P","P\u00e9rez-Carmona N","Alb\u00e0 MM","Robertson K","Ghazal P","Angulo A","Pablo Engel","Nat\u00e0lia P\u00e9rez-Carmona","M Mar Alb\u00e0","Kevin Robertson","Peter Ghazal","Ana Angulo"],"doi":"10.1038\/icb.2011.55","endpage":"766","first_seen_on":"2011-11-03T22:50:58+00:00","funders":["wellcome"],"issns":["1440-1711","0818-9641"],"issue":"7","journal":"Immunology & Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1319068800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21670740"],"pmid":"21670740","pubdate":"2011-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"753","subjects":["cellbiology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Human cytomegalovirus UL7, a homologue of the SLAM-family receptor CD229, impairs cytokine production.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/icb.2011.55","volume":"89","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/human-cytomegalovirus-ul7-homologue-slamfamily-receptor-cd229-impairs-cytokine-production"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626939,"mean":4.9512885298875,"rank":2018712,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":931121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626939,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69320,"mean":3.8266734950013,"rank":27434,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":29536,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69320,"percentile":42},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":385,"mean":3.6100416666667,"rank":240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":93,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":385,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.4958333333333,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
