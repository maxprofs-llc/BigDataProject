We investigated the impact of MSG ingestion on both the plasma and intramuscular amino acid pools. Nine postprandial adults ingested MSG (150 mg\/kg) and rested for 105 min. Venous blood was sampled preingestion and then every 15 min; vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were taken preingestion and at 45, 75, and 105 min postingestion. Venous plasma glutamate and aspartate concentrations increased (P <\/= 0.05) approximately 700-800 and 300-400%, respectively, after 30-45 min. Although several other plasma amino acids increased modestly, the rise in glutamate accounted for approximately 80% of the increase in total plasma amino acids. In addition, plasma insulin increased threefold after 15 min; this occurred before a significant increase in plasma glutamate, indicating a feed-forward stimulation from the gastrointestinal tract. The intramuscular amino acid pool was remarkably constant, with only glutamate increasing (P <\/= 0.05) by 3.56 mmol\/kg dry wt. By 105 min, the plasma and muscle amino acids had returned to resting concentrations. This increase in muscle glutamate concentration could account for approximately 40% of the MSG ingested; we propose that resting skeletal muscle is a major sink for the glutamate and metabolizes it to aspartate.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000220e","authors":["Graham, T E","Sgro, V","Friars, D","Gibala, M J"],"first_seen_on":"2011-11-07T17:50:16+00:00","issns":["1522-1555","0193-1849"],"issue":"1","journal":"American Journal of Physiology: Endocrinology & Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1487327980,"links":["http:\/\/ajpendo.physiology.org\/content\/278\/1\/E83.full","http:\/\/ajpendo.physiology.org\/content\/278\/1\/E83","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10644540","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/10644540\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ajpendo.physiology.org\/content\/278\/1\/E83.full.pdf","pmid":"10644540","pubdate":"2000-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","physiology","endocrinology"],"title":"Glutamate ingestion: the plasma and muscle free amino acid pools of resting humans","type":"article","volume":"278","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/glutamate-ingestion-plasma-muscle-free-amino-acid-pools-resting-humans"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.25,"score_history":{"1y":5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8421960,"mean":7.0860234078473,"rank":1586035,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6828281,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8421960,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90362,"mean":5.2635829395425,"rank":15475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":74745,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90362,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1423,"mean":9.2210098452883,"rank":374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":1047,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1423,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":5.3744285714286,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
