The current WHO classification used since the 70s classifies dengue into dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), dengue shock syndrome (DSS). In 2009, a new classification of dengue proposed by WHO Tropical Disease Research (TDR) was published in the WHO TDR 2009 dengue guidelines. This new classification classifies dengue into dengue (D), dengue with warning signs (DW) and severe dengue (SD).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9263cf058f61000dcfc","first_seen_on":"2011-11-07T00:52:38+00:00","issns":["0125-2208"],"journal":"Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand Chotmaihet thangphaet","last_mentioned_on":1328106654,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22043757"],"pmid":"22043757","pubdate":"2011-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Dengue classification: current WHO vs. the newly suggested classification for better clinical application?","type":"article","volume":"94 Suppl 3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dengue-classification-current-vs-newly-suggested-classification-better-clinical-application"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":1006909,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":2929864,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":65},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73332,"mean":4.1642448623365,"rank":14696,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":55807,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73332,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":398,"mean":1.750120906801,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":318,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":398,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.33333333333333,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
