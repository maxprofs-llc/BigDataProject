This study examined the interaction between 5-HTTLPR and stress, both chronic and episodic, to predict longitudinal change in depressive symptoms among children and adolescents.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026dc","authors":["Jenness, M.A., Jessica L.","Hankin, Ph.D., Benjamin L.","Abela, Ph.D., John R.Z.","Young, Ph.D., Jami F.","Smolen, Ph.D., Andrew"],"doi":"10.1002\/da.20904","endpage":"1080","first_seen_on":"2011-11-05T01:18:32+00:00","issns":["1520-6394","1091-4269"],"issue":"12","journal":"Depression & Anxiety (1091-4269)","last_mentioned_on":1320577228,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/da.20904","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/da.20904\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/da.20904\/pdf","pmid":"22058064","pubdate":"2011-11-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"1074","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Chronic family stress interacts with 5\u00e2\u0080\u0090HTTLPR to predict prospective depressive symptoms among youth","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chronic-family-stress-interacts-5httlpr-predict-prospective-depressive-symptoms-among-youth"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6703220,"mean":6.1628574790691,"rank":2513876,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4088730,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6703220,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83273,"mean":4.7520701796522,"rank":26239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":54637,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83273,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":882,"mean":8.0940612939841,"rank":426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":882,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":3.7302666666667,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
