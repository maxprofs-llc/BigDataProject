Based on the simulation results in a number of typical networks, we examine the isolating and collective effects of some structural features, including average degree, shortcuts, and level of centrality, on the categorization process. This study extends the previous simulations mainly on lexical evolution, and illustrates a general framework to systematically explore the effect of social structure on language evolution.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002323","authors":["Tao Gong","Andrea Baronchelli","Andrea Puglisi","Vittorio Loreto"],"doi":"10.1162\/artl_a_00051","endpage":"15","first_seen_on":"2011-11-04T06:25:27+00:00","issns":["1064-5462","1530-9185"],"journal":"Artificial Life","last_mentioned_on":1320386331,"links":["http:\/\/www.mitpressjournals.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1162\/artl_a_00051"],"pmid":"22035084","pubdate":"2011-10-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Artificial Intelligence And Image Processing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Computer Science"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["biology"],"title":"Exploring the Roles of Complex Networks in Linguistic Categorization","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exploring-roles-complex-networks-linguistic-categorization"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506214,"mean":5.1186469373082,"rank":2325678,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1541098,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506214,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72400,"mean":4.0801963839279,"rank":29085,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":31664,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72400,"percentile":43},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92,"mean":2.561010989011,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
