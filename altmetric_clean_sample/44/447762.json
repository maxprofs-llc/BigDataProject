We examined 30 homeless individuals and 21 housed controls and matched for diagnosis, sex, and age. The participants, recruited from an acute psychiatric inpatient unit, completed a measure of psychiatric symptom severity, a neuropsychological test battery, and a measure of functional capacity, the University of California-San Diego performance-based skills assessment (UPSA). There were no significant differences in performance on the neuropsychological test battery or the UPSA between housed and homeless participants. In a multivariate model, however, cognitive status and housing status were independent predictors of functional capacity, and homelessness was associated with an approximately 9-point lower score on the UPSA. This finding highlights the importance of neuropsychological screening and interventions that promote housing stability for patients with schizophrenia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e6f","doi":"10.1097\/nmd.0b013e3182349cfc","first_seen_on":"2011-11-09T06:48:04+00:00","issns":["0022-3018"],"issue":"11","journal":"Journal of Nervous & Mental Disease","last_mentioned_on":1327689282,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jonmd\/Abstract\/2011\/11000\/Housing_Status_as_an_Independent_Predictor_of.7.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jonmd\/2011\/11000\/Housing_Status_as_an_Independent_Predictor_of.7.pdf","pmid":"22048137","pubdate":"2011-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"854","subjects":["psychiatry","neurology"],"title":"Housing Status as an Independent Predictor of Functional Capacity in Patients With Schizophrenia","type":"article","volume":"199","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/housing-status-independent-predictor-functional-capacity-patients-schizophrenia-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505992,"mean":5.1115236646191,"rank":3109043,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1008876,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505992,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74101,"mean":4.0606304183535,"rank":43981,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":21625,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74101,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1368,"mean":3.1577307973665,"rank":1134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":163,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1368,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":1.4774509803922,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1,"Social Sciences":3,"Psychology":4}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"NG":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/NMD_online\/status\/134159716543758336","citation_ids":[447762],"posted_on":"2011-11-09T06:45:43+00:00","author":{"name":"Jrnl of NMD","url":"http:\/\/www.jonmd.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1241320655\/mental_normal.jpg","description":"The Journal of Nervous & Mental Disease publishes in the field of human behavior.
