This report will give both the investigator and clinician guidelines for clinical trial design that will take into account variables known to effect efficacy results such as baseline severity, pattern, and duration of hair loss, age of the subject, and concomitant conditions that may impact on potential regrowth. Reliable methods of assessment of efficacy and response criteria that will enable direct comparison of results between agents will also be discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026df","authors":["Olsen EA","ELISE A.
