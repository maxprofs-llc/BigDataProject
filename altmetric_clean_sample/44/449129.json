MM patients demonstrated highest early and mature EPCs and VEGFR2(+)-cells in the BM, particularly with advanced and active disease. Endothelial cells differed in BM-, PB- and LP-specimens, albeit seemed less associated with unfavorable prognostic MM-parameters. Our data suggest that especially VEGFR2(+)-cells and mature EPCs in MM are of value to explore further.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4fa3cf058f610003009","doi":"10.1016\/j.leukres.2011.05.021","first_seen_on":"2011-11-10T11:56:22+00:00","issns":["1873-5835"],"issue":"9","journal":"Leukemia Research","last_mentioned_on":1320858176,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21684596?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21684596","pubdate":"2011-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Early and mature endothelial progenitors and VEGFR2+-cells in multiple myeloma: association with disease characteristics and variation in different cell compartments.","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/early-mature-endothelial-progenitors-vegfr2cells-multiple-myeloma-association-disease-characteristic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":4206754,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76028,"mean":4.5159147145093,"rank":62703,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76028,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":458,"mean":1.5502757111597,"rank":357,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":458,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.055,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
