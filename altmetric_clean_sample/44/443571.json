We found stable DUX4 mRNAs only derived from the most distal D4Z4 unit and unexpectedly extended to the flanking pLAM region that provided an intron and a polyadenylation signal. DUX4 encodes a transcription factor expressed in FSHD but not control primary myoblasts or muscle biopsies. The DUX4 protein initiates a large transcription deregulation cascade leading to muscle atrophy and oxidative stress, which are FSHD key features.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2011PLoSO...6E6820V","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["C\u00e9line Vanderplanck","Eug\u00e9nie Ansseau","S\u00e9bastien Charron","Nadia Stricwant","Alexandra Tassin","Dalila Laoudj-Chenivesse","Steve D.
