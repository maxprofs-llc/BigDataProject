However, little is known about the satisfaction of staff of insurance companies with medical appraisals that they have commissioned.Our questionnaire survey prospectively included all medical appraisals arriving at Swiss insurances from FEB to APR 2008. We assessed the satisfaction of the commissioner with medical appraisals performed by medical assessors. In addition, we evaluated the contribution of several factors to overall satisfaction. The unit of sample was the medical appraisal.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000798","authors":["Klaus Eichler","Klaus Eichler","Daniel Imhof","Yvonne Bollag","Susanna St\u00f6hr","Niklaus Gyr","Holger Auerbach"],"doi":"10.1186\/1756-0500-4-83","first_seen_on":"2011-11-06T03:09:42+00:00","issns":["1756-0500"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Research Notes","last_mentioned_on":1301475483,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1756-0500\/4\/83"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1756-0500-4-83.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3078089","pmid":"21443762","pubdate":"2011-03-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"83","subjects":["medicine","biology"],"title":"Satisfaction of staff of Swiss insurance companies with medical appraisals: a cross sectional study","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/satisfaction-staff-swiss-insurance-companies-medical-appraisals-cross-sectional-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626596,"mean":4.9527436744422,"rank":2907474,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":72887,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626596,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70006,"mean":3.8138578958646,"rank":48061,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":284,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70006,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1060,"mean":3.3603871576959,"rank":813,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1060,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":3.2224375,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Social Sciences":1,"Business, Management and Accounting":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Abstract | Satisfaction of staff of Swiss insurance companies with medical appraisals: a cross secti","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=176058205779205&id=127469827309912","citation_ids":[444150],"posted_on":"2011-03-30T08:58:03+00:00","summary":"Hier \"taufrisch\" die Publikation des WIG zum Projekt \"Gutachtensituation in der Schweiz\" in BMC Research Notes.","author":{"name":"WIG Winterthurer Institut f\u00fcr Gesundheits\u00f6konomie","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/127469827309912","facebook_wall_name":"WIG Winterthurer Institut f\u00fcr Gesundheits\u00f6konomie","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/127469827309912\/picture","id_on_source":"127469827309912"}}]}}
