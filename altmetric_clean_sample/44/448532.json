However, we have recently reported that Chili leaf curl betasatellite (ChLCB) is also occasionally found associated with the disease in Pakistan. The question as to whether ChLCB contributes to the development of disease symptoms such as leaf curling and enations remain to be answered. We have previously shown that the expression of \u03b2C1 of CLCuMB develops all symptoms of cotton leaf curl disease in Nicotiana benthamiana when expressed from PVX vector.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008a9","authors":["Muhammad N Tahir","Muhammad N Tahir","Shahid Mansoor"],"doi":"10.1186\/1743-422x-8-509","first_seen_on":"2011-11-10T11:03:15+00:00","issns":["1743-422X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Virology Journal","last_mentioned_on":1320880086,"links":["http:\/\/www.virologyj.com\/content\/8\/1\/509\/abstract"],"pmid":"22067326","pubdate":"2011-11-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"509","title":"\u03b2C1 of chili leaf curl betasatellite is a pathogenicity determinant","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/%CE%B2c1-chili-leaf-curl-betasatellite-pathogenicity-determinant"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633617,"mean":4.9215564192856,"rank":2897775,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":82247,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633617,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71036,"mean":3.7687021327514,"rank":48077,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":482,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71036,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1127,"mean":3.2550177619893,"rank":926,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1127,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97,"mean":1.0741041666667,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
