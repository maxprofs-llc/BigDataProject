FL-SBL was readily accumulated into the PEGylated DSPC liposomes prepared from DSPC, CH, and DSPE-PEG-OMe by the post insertion protocol. The boron concentrations and the fluorescent intensities of the FL-SBL-labeled DSPC liposomes increased with the increase of the additive FL-SBL, and the maximum emission wavelength of the liposomes appeared at 531 nm. A preliminary in vivo imaging study of tumor-bearing mice revealed that the FL-SBL-labeled DSPC liposomes were delivered to the tumor tissue but not distributed to hypoxic regions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f6100083f3","authors":["Hiroyuki Nakamura","Noriko Ueda","Hyun Seung Ban","Manabu Ueno","Shoji Tachikawa"],"doi":"10.1039\/c1ob06500a","endpage":"1380","first_seen_on":"2011-11-08T03:22:23+00:00","issns":["1477-0539","1477-0520"],"issue":"7","journal":"Organic and Biomolecular Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1320720123,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlelanding\/2011\/ob\/c1ob06500a"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2011\/ob\/c1ob06500a","pmid":"22193924","pubdate":"2011-11-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1374","subjects":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"title":"Design and synthesis of fluorescence-labeled closo-dodecaborate lipid: its liposome formation and in vivo imaging targeting of tumors for boron neutron capture therapy","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/design-synthesis-calixarene"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505992,"mean":5.1115236646191,"rank":2328036,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1533863,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505992,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73577,"mean":4.0645232140915,"rank":29424,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":32300,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73577,"percentile":43},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1230,"mean":2.8223043124491,"rank":592,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":459,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1230,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":2.2985161290323,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
