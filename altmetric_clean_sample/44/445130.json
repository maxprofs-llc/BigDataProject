Thus, to help patients change their habits, it is essential to identify the most effective approach. Many efforts have been devoted to explain changes in or adherence to specific health behaviors. Such efforts have resulted in the development of theories that have been applied in prevention campaigns, and that include brief advice and counseling services. Within this context, Motivational Interviewing has proven to be effective in changing health behaviors in specific cases. However, more robust evidence is needed on the effectiveness of Motivational Interviewing in treating chronic pathologies -such as dyslipidemia- in patients assisted by general practitioners. This article describes a protocol to assess the effectiveness of MI as compared with general practice (brief advice), with the aim of improving lipid level control in patients with dyslipidemia assisted by a general practitioner.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b6","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2296-12-125","first_seen_on":"2011-11-07T10:02:49+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Family Practice","last_mentioned_on":1336870645,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2296\/12\/125","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22054017?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2296\/12\/125\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2296-12-125.pdf","pmid":"22054017","pubdate":"2011-11-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"125","subjects":["primaryhealthcare"],"title":"Effectiveness of Motivational Interviewing in improving lipid level in patients with dyslipidemia assisted by general practitioners: Dislip-EM study protocol","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effectiveness-motivational-interviewing-improving-lipid-level-patients-dyslipidemia-assisted-general"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":654545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":3850079,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73331,"mean":4.171827219419,"rank":9799,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":63475,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73331,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":769,"mean":3.7382291666667,"rank":135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":634,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":769,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":2.5691666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":3,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
