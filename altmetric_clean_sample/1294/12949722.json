However, entangled MOFs showing such flexible behavior pose a great challenge in terms of extracting information on their dynamics because of their poor single-crystallinity. In this article, detailed experimental studies on a twofold entangled MOF (f-MOF-1) are reported, which unveil its structural response toward external stimuli such as temperature, pressure, and guest molecules. The crystallographic study shows multiple structural changes in f-MOF-1, by which the 3\u2009D net deforms and slides upon guest removal. Two distinct desolvated phases, that is, f-MOF-1\u2009a and f-MOF-1\u2009b, could be isolated; the former is a metastable one and transformable to the latter phase upon heating. The two phases show different gated CO2 adsorption profiles. DFT-based calculations provide an insight into the selective and gated adsorption behavior with CO2 of f-MOF-1\u2009b. The gate-opening threshold pressure of CO2 adsorption can be tuned strategically by changing the chemical functionality of the linker from ethanylene (-CH2 -CH2 -) in f-MOF-1 to an azo (-N=N-) functionality in an analogous MOF, f-MOF-2. The modulation of functionality has an indirect influence on the gate-opening pressure owing to the difference in inter-net interaction. The framework of f-MOF-1 is highly responsive toward CO2 gas molecules, and these results are supported by DFT calculations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Kanoo, Prakash","Haldar, Ritesh","Reddy, Sandeep K.","Hazra, Arpan","Bonakala, Satyanarayana","Matsuda, Ryotaro","Kitagawa, Susumu","Balasubramanian, Sundaram","Maji, Tapas Kumar","Prakash Kanoo","Ritesh Haldar","Sandeep K.
