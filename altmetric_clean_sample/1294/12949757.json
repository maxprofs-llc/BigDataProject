This full account details distinct approaches to (\u00b1)- and (-)-rocaglamide utilizing Br\u00f8nsted acid catalyzed and asymmetric Pd(0) -catalyzed Nazarov chemistry developed in our laboratory, respectively. The successful asymmetric synthesis revealed unforeseen mechanistic complexity that required adjusting our strategy to overcome an unanticipated racemization process, an unusual reversible ring-cleavage step and a very facile trialkylsilyl group migration.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Zhou, Zhe","Dixon, Darryl D.","Jolit, Anais","Tius, Marcus A."],"doi":"10.1002\/chem.201603312","endpage":"15936","first_seen_on":"2016-10-24T14:36:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1521-3765"],"issue":"44","journal":"Chemistry - A European Journal","last_mentioned_on":1476892543,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201603312\/abstract;jsessionid=A99C39B2D1206F4189655143B369C11B.f03t04"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201603312\/pdf","pmid":"27717051","pubdate":"2016-09-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"15929","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"The Evolution of the Total Synthesis of Rocaglamide","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evolution-total-synthesis-rocaglamide"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7560115,"mean":6.5270342886323,"rank":6548080,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7560115,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234365,"mean":12.669875757369,"rank":191305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234365,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5303,"mean":3.1017566955866,"rank":3679,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5303,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":560,"mean":2.2186118067979,"rank":314,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":560,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":3,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ChemEurJ\/statuses\/788770613527805953","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12949757],"posted_on":"2016-10-19T15:55:43+00:00","author":{"name":"Chemistry","url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/journal\/10.1002\/(ISSN)1521-3765","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/669149218846720000\/C7lWCugX_normal.jpg","description":"Chemistry - A European Journal\r\nMultidisciplinary Chemistry Journal from ChemPubSoc Europe","id_on_source":"ChemEurJ","tweeter_id":"1522831152","geo":{"lt":49.54887,"ln":8.66697,"country":"DE"},"followers":3518},"tweet_id":"788770613527805953"}]}}
