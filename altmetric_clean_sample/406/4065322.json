Based on clinical presentation and serological diagnosis, all reported SHF outbreaks were thought to be caused by different strains of the same virus, simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV; Arteriviridae). Here we show that SHF outbreaks in Sukhumi in 1964 and in Alamogordo in 1989 were not caused by SHFV, but by two novel, divergent arteriviruses. Our results indicate that multiple, divergent simian arteriviruses can cause SHF.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f92","authors":["Michael Lauck","Sergey V.
