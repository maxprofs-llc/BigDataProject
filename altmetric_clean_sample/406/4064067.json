(Z. Lu)"],"citation":{"abstract":"A new type of multistimuli-responsive hydrogels cross-linked by metal ions and biopolymers is reported. By mixing the biopolymer chitosan (CS) with a variety of metal ions at the appropriate pH values, we obtained a series of transparent and stable hydrogels within a few seconds through supramolecular complexation. In particular, the CS-Ag hydrogel was chosen as the model and the gelation mechanism was revealed by various measurements. It was found that the facile association of Ag(+) ions with amino and hydroxy groups in CS chains promoted rapid gel-network formation. Interestingly, the CS-Ag hydrogel exhibits sharp phase transitions in response to multiple external stimuli, including pH value, chemical redox reactions, cations, anions, and neutral species. Furthermore, this soft matter showed a remarkable moldability to form shape-persistent, free-standing objects by a fast in situ gelation procedure.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Sun, Zhifang","Lv, Fucong","Cao, Lujie","Liu, Lin","Zhang, Yi","Lu, Zhouguang"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201502228","endpage":"7948","first_seen_on":"2015-05-27T17:53:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1521-3773"],"issue":"27","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
