It argues that psychiatric asylums and clinics were the first institutions in which human heredity became the object of systematic research. It also highlights the different concepts of heredity prevalent in the psychiatric community. The first of four parts traces how heredity became a central category of asylum statistics in the first half of the nineteenth century. The second part deals with attempts to introduce new methods of surveying in order to generate more precise data about psychopathological inheritance in the 1860s and 1870s. The third part discusses how, by the end of the nineteenth century, a widespread discontent with the results of asylum statistics led to an increasing interest in the use of family studies. Finally, the fourth part examines the impact of Mendelian theory on psychiatric statistics in the early twentieth century.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4dd3cf058f610001be2","authors":["Gausemeier, Bernd"],"doi":"10.1007\/s40656-014-0050-x","first_seen_on":"2015-05-28T11:04:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0391-9714"],"issue":"4","journal":"History & Philosophy of the Life Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1432880993,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26013313?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26013313","pubdate":"2015-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"History And Philosophy Of Specific Fields","scheme":"era"},{"name":"History of Science","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Philosophy","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Philosophy of Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Philosophy of Science","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Arts and Humanities"],"subjects":["biology","historyofmedicine"],"title":"Pedigrees of madness: the study of heredity in nineteenth and early twentieth century psychiatry.","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pedigrees-madness-study-heredity-nineteenth-early-twentieth-century-psychiatry"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.95,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5163159,"mean":6.0993138730238,"rank":1126565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":4030186,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5163159,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173220,"mean":8.8412879534002,"rank":48960,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":123889,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173220,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":3.5871071428571,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":22.17,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
