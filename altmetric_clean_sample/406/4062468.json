We propose a modification to this technique to make easier the production of mesenchymal compartment, to reduce the cost and to improve the histological quality of the self-assembled tissues. The stroma produced by this novel approach allowed epithelial cell differentiation, resulting in a pseudostratified epithelium that shared several features with native tissues. The incorporation of endothelial cells in the reconstructed mesenchyme formed a three-dimensional capillary-like network, positive for CD31 and von Willebrand factor and surrounded by NG2 positive cells. It could limit self-contraction of the resulting tissue by recruiting \u03b1-Smooth Muscle Actin positive cells. With this new technique, which is relatively inexpensive and easy to use in a research laboratory set-up, near-native stromas can now be produced with minimal handling time.
