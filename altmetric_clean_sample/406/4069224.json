Legislation mandates that care for YSHCN demonstrates effective coordination of care that is patient centered and age appropriate. Transition programs are recommended by leading authorities. In order to provide fair and equable care a universal rating process needs to be implemented to describe the patients' functional status and progress. NOC has the potential to measure patient acuity and outcomes for YSHCN that potentially may guide care needs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a86","authors":["Celona, Carol Anne"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pedn.2015.05.005","first_seen_on":"2015-05-29T01:35:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0882-5963","1532-8449"],"journal":"Journal of Pediatric Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1432863266,"links":["http:\/\/www.pediatricnursing.org\/article\/S0882-5963(15)00149-9\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pediatricnursing.org\/article\/S0882596315001499\/pdf","pmid":"26028567","pubdate":"2015-06-02T22:02:59+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing","pediatrics"],"title":"Measuring Acuity and Patient Progress for Youth With Special Health Care Needs in Transition Care Utilizing Nursing Outcomes","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/measuring-acuity-patient-progress-youth-special-health-care-needs-transition-care-utilizing-nursing"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5163199,"mean":6.0993027755301,"rank":3626084,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":870193,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5163199,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172965,"mean":8.8390718646656,"rank":123229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":30887,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172965,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":317,"mean":2.5192025316456,"rank":172,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":317,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":0.95227272727273,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
