A repeated-measures analysis of variance suggests that this difference is statistically significant (P = .04). Older children (n = 8) did not show this pattern.\nInadequate analgesia for initial procedures in young children may diminish the effect of adequate analgesia in subsequent procedures.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005736","authors":["Weisman, S J","Bernstein, B","Schechter, N L"],"first_seen_on":"2015-05-28T20:53:24+00:00","issns":["1072-4710"],"issue":"2","journal":"Archives of pediatrics & adolescent medicine (Online)","last_mentioned_on":1436301540,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9491040"],"pmid":"9491040","pubdate":"1998-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Consequences of inadequate analgesia during painful procedures in children.","type":"article","volume":"152","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/consequences-inadequate-analgesia-during-painful-procedures-children"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.784,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.784},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5467091,"mean":6.35456834623,"rank":506799,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":4960258,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5467091,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179738,"mean":8.8712249564642,"rank":24899,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":154836,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179738,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":870,"mean":10.054393555811,"rank":169,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":701,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":870,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":11.1,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
