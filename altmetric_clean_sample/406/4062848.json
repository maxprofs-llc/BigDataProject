Why some arenaviruses can cause virulent human infections while others cannot, even though they are isolated from the same rodent hosts, is an enigma. Recent studies have revealed several potential pathogenic mechanisms of arenaviruses, including factors that increase viral replication capacity and suppress host innate immunity, which leads to high viremia and generalized immune suppression as the hallmarks of severe and lethal arenaviral HF diseases. This review summarizes current knowledge of the roles of each of the four viral proteins and some known cellular factors in the pathogenesis of arenaviral HF as well as of some human primary cell-culture and animal models that lend themselves to studying arenavirus-induced HF disease pathogenesis. Knowledge gained from these studies can be applied towards the development of novel therapeutics and vaccines against these deadly human pathogens.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef652a83ee09648b4f1a","authors":["Shao, Junjie","Liang, Yuying","Ly, Hinh"],"doi":"10.3390\/pathogens4020283","first_seen_on":"2015-05-27T12:16:53+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid"],"issns":["2076-0817"],"issue":"2","journal":"Pathogens","last_mentioned_on":1443472024,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26011826?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26011826?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4493475\/"],"pmid":"26011826","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Human Hemorrhagic Fever Causing Arenaviruses: Molecular Mechanisms Contributing to Virus Virulence and Disease Pathogenesis","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/human-hemorrhagic-fever-causing-arenaviruses-molecular-mechanisms-contributing-virus-virulence-disea"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6411954,"mean":5.8673333747154,"rank":4737499,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":949704,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6411954,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":182738,"mean":8.9035338218314,"rank":130220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":32579,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":182738,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125,"mean":2.8573709677419,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":5.925,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
