Therefore, there is a need to develop new anticancer strategies. Theranostics is a strategy that combines treatment with diagnosis and monitoring. Metal nanoparticles are proposed as one of the most promising theranostic agents for the treatment of cancer. Thus, metals including iron, gold (Au), silver (Ag), zinc (Zn), and titanium, have potential as anticancer agents, either inherently or as a result of surface modifications. As a functional component of theranostic tools, metal nanoparticles have crucial dual roles as a diagnostic and active therapeutic agent for the treatment of cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002734","authors":["Sharma, Harshita","Mishra, Pawan K","Talegaonkar, Sushama","Vaidya, Bhuvaneshwar"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.drudis.2015.05.009","first_seen_on":"2015-05-27T10:02:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1878-5832","13596446"],"journal":"Drug Discovery Today","last_mentioned_on":1449254971,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26007605?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1359644615001993","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.drudis.2015.05.009"],"pmid":"26007605","pubdate":"2015-05-27T22:04:47+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Metal nanoparticles: a theranostic nanotool against cancer.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metal-nanoparticles-theranostic-nanotool-against-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6647401,"mean":6.157074757346,"rank":1432550,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":5189505,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6647401,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":211733,"mean":8.1813821151268,"rank":58612,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":152278,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":211733,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":841,"mean":5.0179642857143,"rank":234,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":602,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":841,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.7022727272727,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
