We reviewed systematically records of 47 adolescents who fulfilled criteria for ICD-10 F50.0 (n\u2009=\u200934) or F50.1 (n\u2009=\u200913), assessing the impact of diagnostic subtype, comorbidity, background factors and treatment choices on recovery. Atypical AN patients were significantly older (p\u2009=\u20090.03), heavier (minimum body mass index 16.7 vs 15.1\u2009kg\/m(2) , p\u2009=\u20090.003) and less prone to comorbidities (38% vs 71%, p\u2009=\u20090.04) and had shorter, less intensive and less costly treatments than typical AN patients. The diagnosis of typical versus atypical AN was the sole significant predictor of treatment success: recovery from atypical AN was 4.3 times (95% confidence interval [1.1, 17.5]) as likely as recovery from typical AN. Overall, our findings indicate that a broader definition of AN may dilute the prognostic value of the diagnosis, and therefore, ICD-11 should retain its distinction between typical and atypical AN.
