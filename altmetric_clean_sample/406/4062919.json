It can be valuable to maintain a history of the data and reasoning involved. This history, commonly known as provenance information, can be a resource for \"reflection-in-action\"' during analysis, supporting collaboration between analysts, and can help trace data quality and uncertainty through the analysis process. Currently, there is limited work on utilizing analytic provenance, which captures the interactive data exploration and human reasoning process, to support sensemaking. This article presents and extends the research challenges discussed in a IEEE VIS 2014 workshop on this topic to provide an agenda for sensemaking analytic provenance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a39","authors":["Xu, Kai","Attfield, Simon","Jankun-Kelly, T J","Wheat, Ashley","Nguyen, Phong H","Selvaraj, Nallini"],"doi":"10.1109\/mcg.2015.50","first_seen_on":"2015-05-27T12:31:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1558-1756"],"issue":"3","journal":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","last_mentioned_on":1432729835,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26010789?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26010789","pubdate":"2015-05-27T22:01:44+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Artificial Intelligence And Image Processing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physical Sciences","Computer Science"],"subjects":["medicalinformatics"],"title":"Analytic Provenance for Sensemaking: A Research Agenda.","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/analytic-provenance-sensemaking-research-agenda"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5153949,"mean":6.0935032999967,"rank":4285436,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5153949,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173105,"mean":8.8528149782791,"rank":142317,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173105,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":153,"mean":2.0808552631579,"rank":138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":153,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.625,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
