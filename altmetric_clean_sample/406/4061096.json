By means of this approach, a unique MOF material based on the target [Zn8 (ad)4 ] (ad=adeninate) clusters and C3 -symmetric organic linkers can be obtained, with trigonal microporous (ca., 0.8\u2005nm) and hexagonal mesoporous (ca., 3.0\u2005nm) 1D channels. Moreover, the resulting 446-MOF shows distinct reactivity to transition and lanthanide metal ions. Significantly, the transmetalation of Co(II) or Ni(II) on the Zn(II) centers in 446-MOF can enhance the sorption capacities of CO2 and CH4 (16-21\u2009%), whereas the impregnation of Eu(III) and Tb(III) in the channels of 446-MOF will result in adjustable light-emitting behaviors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Du, Miao","Wang, Xi","Chen, Min","Li, Cheng\u2010Peng","Tian, Jia\u2010Yue","Wang, Zhuo\u2010Wei","Liu, Chun\u2010Sen"],"doi":"10.1002\/chem.201500457","endpage":"9719","first_seen_on":"2015-05-27T03:14:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3765"],"issue":"27","journal":"Chemistry - A European Journal","last_mentioned_on":1432697675,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201500457\/abstract;jsessionid=EB4035DED6E07BDBA90D379E37EB478D.f04t03"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201500457\/pdf","pmid":"26013160","pubdate":"2015-05-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"9713","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Ligand Symmetry Modulation for Designing a Mesoporous Metal\u2013Organic Framework: Dual Reactivity to Transition and Lanthanide Metals for Enhanced Functionalization","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ligand-symmetry-modulation-designing-mesoporous-metalorganic-framework-dual-reactivity-transition-la"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6372045,"mean":5.9849587968944,"rank":5427716,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6372045,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176837,"mean":8.9479312357213,"rank":143561,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176837,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2870,"mean":3.6355789473684,"rank":1962,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2870,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":134,"mean":3.0959248120301,"rank":97,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":134,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
