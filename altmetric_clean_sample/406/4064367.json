The estimates were grouped into sets of procedures performed in phases of cervical cancer care: the screening, diagnosis and treatment of precancerous lesions and the treatment of cervical cancer. The costs were estimated for the public and private health systems, using data from national health information systems, population surveys, and literature reviews. The cost estimates are presented in 2006 USD.\nFrom the societal perspective, the estimated total costs of the prevention and treatment of cervical cancer amounted to USD $1,321,683,034, which was categorized as follows: procedures (USD $213,199,490), visits (USD $325,509,842), transportation (USD $106,521,537) and productivity losses (USD $676,452,166). Indirect costs represented 51% of the total costs, followed by direct medical costs (visits and procedures) at 41% and direct non-medical costs (transportation) at 8%. The public system represented 46% of the total costs, and the private system represented 54%.\nOur national cost estimates of cervical cancer prevention and treatment, indicating the economic importance of cervical cancer screening and care, will be useful in monitoring the effect of the HPV vaccine introduction and are of interest in research and health care management.","authors":["Novaes, Hillegonda Maria Dutilh","Itria, Alexander","Silva, Gulnar Azevedo e","Sartori, Ana Marli Christovam","Rama, Cristina Helena","So\u00e1rez, Patr\u00edcia Coelho de","Novaes, Hillegonda Maria Dutilh","Itria, Alexander","Silva, Gulnar Azevedo e","Sartori, Ana Marli Christovam","Rama, Cristina Helena","So\u00e1rez, Patr\u00edcia Coelho de"],"doi":"10.6061\/clinics\/2015(04)12","first_seen_on":"2015-05-27T19:37:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1807-5932","1980-5322"],"issue":"4","journal":"Clinics","last_mentioned_on":1443684993,"links":["http:\/\/www.scielo.br\/scielo.php?lng=en&nrm=iso&pid=S1807-59322015000400289&script=sci_arttext&tlng=en","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26017797?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.scielo.br\/scielo.php?lng=en&nrm=iso&pid=S1807-59322015000400289&script=sci_arttext&tlng=en#.VWkgByeTkqk.twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.scielo.br\/scielo.php?script=sci_pdf&pid=S1807-59322015000400289&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en","pmid":"26017797","pubdate":"2015-05-29T14:49:49+00:00","publisher":"Faculdade de Medicina \/ USP","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Annual national direct and indirect cost estimates of the prevention and treatment of cervical cancer in Brazil","type":"article","volume":"70","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/annual-national-direct-indirect-cost-estimates-prevention-treatment-cervical-cancer-brazil-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
