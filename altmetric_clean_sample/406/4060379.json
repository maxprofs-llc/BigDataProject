Mean [THg] and [TSe] of bearded seal liver and skeletal muscle tissues were used for intertissular comparison. Se:Hg molar ratios were used to investigate elemental associations and potential antioxidant protection against Hg toxicosis. Age was an important factor in [THg] and Se:Hg molar ratios in heart and kidney. Small, but statistically significant differences in mean [THg] occurred among some of the five heart regions (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Mean [THg] was highest in liver at 3.057\u00b5g\/g and lowest in heart left ventricle at 0.017\u00b5g\/g. Mean [THg] ranked: liver\u2009>\u2009kidney cortex\u2009>\u2009kidney medulla\u2009>\u2009skeletal muscle\u2009>\u2009heart left ventricle (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Mean [TSe] was highest in liver at 3.848\u00b5g\/g and lowest in heart left ventricle at 0.632\u00b5g\/g. Mean [TSe] ranked: liver\u2009>\u2009kidney cortex\u2009>\u2009kidney medulla\u2009>\u2009skeletal muscle\u2009>\u2009heart left ventricle (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Se:Hg molar ratios were significantly greater than 1.0 in all tissues (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and represented baselines for normal [TSe] under relatively low [THg]. Mean Se:Hg molar ratios ranked: heart left ventricle\u2009>\u2009kidney medulla\u2009>\u2009kidney cortex (p\u2009<\u20090.001). This article is protected by copyright.
