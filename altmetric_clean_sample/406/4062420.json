The Cardiovascular Intervention Improvement Telemedicine Study (CITIES) was a tailored behavioral pharmacist-administered and telephone-based intervention for reducing CVD risk.\nTo (a) describe patient-reported barriers to taking their medication as prescribed and (b) evaluate patient-level characteristics associated with reporting medication barriers.\nWe recruited patients receiving care at primary care clinics affiliated with Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Eligible patients were diagnosed with hypertension and\/or hyperlipidemia that were poorly controlled (blood pressure of greater than\u2009150\/100 mmHg and\/or low-density lipoprotein value\u2009 greater than\u2009130 mg\/dL). At the time of enrollment, patients completed an interview with 7 questions derived from a validated medication barriers measure. Patient characteristics and individual medication treatment barriers are described. Multivariable linear regression was used to examine the association between a medication barrier score and patient characteristics.\nMost patients (n\u2009=\u2009428) were married or living with their partners (57%) and were men (85%) who were diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia (64%). The most commonly reported barriers were having too much medication to take (31%) and forgetting whether medication was taken at a particular time (24%). In adjusted analysis, those who were not employed (1.32, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.50-2.14) or did not have someone to help with tasks, if needed (1.66, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.42-2.89), reported higher medication barrier scores. Compared with those diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia, those with only hypertension (0.91, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.04-1.79) reported higher medication barrier scores.\nBarriers to medication adherence are common. Evaluating and addressing barriers may increase medication adherence.","authors":["Zullig, Leah L","Stechuchak, Karen M","Goldstein, Karen M","Olsen, Maren K","McCant, Felicia M","Danus, Susanne","Crowley, Matthew J","Oddone, Eugene Z","Bosworth, Hayden B","Leah L.
