Most studies have reported an elevation in platelet serotonin in persons with autism. The serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) transporter in the brain uptakes 5-HT from extracellular spaces. It is also present in platelets, where it takes up 5-HT from plasma. Polymorphisms in serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) were frequently studied in many neuropsychiatric disorders.\nWe have measured the plasma 5-HT levels in 20 autistic male children and 20 control male children by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. In addition, the SLC6A4 promoter region (5-HTTLPR) insertion\/deletion (I\/D) polymorphism was studied, using whole genomic DNA.\nPlasma serotonin was significantly low in autistic children compared to control (P = 0.001), although correlation to severity of autism was not significant. The frequency of short (S) allele in autism cases was 10% and in the control group it was absent.\nOur study demonstrated an increased prevalence of 5-HTTLPR S allele in autism subjects. Significantly decreased plasma serotonin was detected in autism subjects, with no significant relationship between 5-HTTLPR genotype and plasma 5-HT being evident.","altmetric_jid":"56e1a36d2a83eefd1f8b456b","authors":["Meguid, Nagwa A","Gebril, Ola H","Khalil, Rehab O"],"doi":"10.4103\/2277-9175.156658","first_seen_on":"2015-05-28T09:32:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2277-9175"],"journal":"Advanced Biomedical Research","last_mentioned_on":1432805531,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26015920"],"pmid":"26015920","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"A study of blood serotonin and serotonin transporter promoter variant (5-HTTLPR) polymorphism in Egyptian autistic children.","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/study-blood-serotonin-serotonin-transporter-promoter-variant-5httlpr-polymorphism-egyptian-autistic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5160020,"mean":6.0977055057378,"rank":4290404,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5160020,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173178,"mean":8.841275504253,"rank":142294,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173178,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15866,"mean":3.3707575165459,"rank":11688,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15866,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":714,"mean":2.5941626928471,"rank":649,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":714,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Computer Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PaulWhiteleyPhD\/status\/603856282618089472","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4066167],"posted_on":"2015-05-28T09:32:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Paul Whiteley","url":"http:\/\/questioning-answers.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000344449848\/35f9d576889f4cf18b0bcf1f367afa4f_normal.jpeg","description":"Autism research, research blogging & tweeting & health science stuff.
