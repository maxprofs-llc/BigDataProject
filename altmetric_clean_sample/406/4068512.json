The host-parasite relationship in cattle that are infected by T. vivax has only been poorly studied. In the present study, a total of 429 serum proteinograms were produced from naturally infected animals (NIF) and were compared with 50 samples from control animals (C). The total protein, IgA band, complement C3 \u03b2 chain band, albumin band, antitrypsin band, IgG band, haptoglobin band, complement C3c \u03b1 chain band and protein HP-20 band presented higher levels in the serum proteinograms of the NIF group. Inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4, \u03b12-macroglobulin, complement C6, ceruloplasmin, transferrin band and apolipoprotein A1 band presented lower levels in this group. There was no significant difference (p<0.05) in acid glycoprotein serum concentration between the NIF and C groups. Acute phase proteins may be useful for understanding the host-parasite relationship, since the antitrypsin band was only present in the NIF group. This can be used as an indicator for infection in cattle that are naturally infected by T. vivax.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036fd","authors":["Sampaio, Paulo Henrique","Junior, Otavio Luiz Fidelis","Marques, Luiz Carlos","Machado, Rosangela Zacarias","Barnab\u00e9, Patr\u00edcia de Athayde","Andr\u00e9, Marcos Rog\u00e9rio","Balbuena, Tiago Santana","Cadioli, Fabiano Antonio"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.vetpar.2015.05.014","first_seen_on":"2015-05-28T22:06:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-2550"],"journal":"Veterinary Parasitology","last_mentioned_on":1432850765,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26012859?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26012859","pubdate":"2015-05-29T22:05:50+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Fisheries Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"Acute-phase protein behavior in dairy cattle herd naturally infected with Trypanosoma vivax.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/acutephase-protein-behavior-dairy-cattle-herd-naturally-infected-trypanosoma-vivax"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5159879,"mean":6.0977562275723,"rank":4290365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5159879,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173176,"mean":8.841464807276,"rank":142298,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173176,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1390,"mean":1.8357552195824,"rank":1035,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1390,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":1.4783018867925,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
