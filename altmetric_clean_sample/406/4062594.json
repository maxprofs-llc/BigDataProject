Few studies have investigated polymorphisms and serum\/plasma levels of IL-27 in diseases including cancers. This study has analyzed the associations of IL-27 gene polymorphisms, as well as plasma levels of IL-27, with susceptibility to bladder cancer and clinical outcome.\nThree hundred and thirty-two patients (nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC)\/muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC): 176\/156) included in a 60-month follow-up program and 499 controls were enrolled. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs153109 and rs17855750, were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method. Plasma concentration of IL-27 was determined by ELISA in 124 patients (NMIBC\/MIBC: 50\/74) and 151 controls.\nSignificantly increased risk for bladder cancer was associated with AG\/GG genotypes of rs153109 (P\u2009=\u20090.029). No GG genotype of rs17855750 was observed in controls, while 4 patients were found to be GG homozygotes, suggesting GG genotype may be associated with bladder cancer risk (P\u2009=\u20090.006). For bladder cancer patients, SNP rs17855750 was also associated with increased risk for MIBC. For MIBC patients, but not NMIBC, TG\/GG genotypes of rs17855750 turned out to be a protective factor for overall survival (P\u2009=\u20090.035). Significantly reduced plasma levels of IL-27 were observed in both NMIBC and MIBC patients compared with controls (P\u2009<\u20090.0001).\nOur data suggest that polymorphisms and reduced plasma levels of IL-27 may predict the susceptibility to bladder cancer, and rs17855750 may be a useful marker to distinguish patients with high risk of death.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008b0","authors":["Bin Zhou","Peng Zhang","Tielong Tang","Hong Liao","Kui Zhang","Yan Pu","Peng Chen","Yaping Song","Lin Zhang"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12885-015-1459-7","first_seen_on":"2015-05-27T11:20:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-2407"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1432727602,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2407\/15\/433"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/s12885-015-1459-7.pdf","pmid":"26014498","pubdate":"2015-05-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Animal Models","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Stem Cells","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Polymorphisms and plasma levels of IL-27: impact on genetic susceptibility and clinical outcome of bladder cancer","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/polymorphisms-plasma-levels-il27-impact-genetic-susceptibility-clinical-outcome-bladder-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5153949,"mean":6.0935032999967,"rank":3403366,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1534839,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5153949,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173105,"mean":8.8528120898421,"rank":115289,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":49645,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173105,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2849,"mean":2.6206453651685,"rank":1551,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":1050,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2849,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":211,"mean":3.310180952381,"rank":135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":211,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Master":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Psychology":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/whatDNAtest\/status\/603521033627303936","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4062594],"posted_on":"2015-05-27T11:20:01+00:00","author":{"name":"Carlos Esteban PhD","url":"http:\/\/whatdnatest.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2209463838\/c-azul-negro2_normal.jpg","description":"News and comments on #genetics, #genomics, #RareDiseases and DNA testing.
