The intervention or control consisted of three counselling sessions.\nResults of the interaction (Group\u2009\u00d7\u2009Time) effects using GEE indicated that there were statistically significant differences between the three study groups over the 6-month follow-up on the ASSIST tobacco score (Wald \u03c7(2)\u2009=\u20098.43, P\u2009=\u20090.004), and past week tobacco use abstinence (Wald \u03c7(2)\u2009=\u20097.34, P\u2009=\u20090.007). Although there were no significant interaction effects on the other outcomes (Alcohol ASSIST score, low alcohol risk score, past week tobacco abstinence or low alcohol risk score, and past week tobacco abstinence and low alcohol risk score), the scores in all of the six outcome measures showed consistent improvements. For past week tobacco abstinence the tobacco only intervention was more effective than the alcohol only intervention and the integrated alcohol and tobacco intervention. For the outcome of low alcohol risk, the alcohol only intervention and the integrated alcohol and tobacco intervention was more effective than the tobacco only or alcohol only intervention.\nThe study found that for past week tobacco abstinence the tobacco only intervention was more effective than the alcohol only intervention and the polydrug use (alcohol and tobacco) integrated intervention.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000089d","authors":["Pengpid, Supa","Peltzer, Karl","Puckpinyo, Apa","Viripiromgool, Somchai","Thamma-Aphiphol, Kriengsak","Suthisukhon, Kawinarat","Dumee, Dussanee","Kongtapan, Thiprada"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13011-015-0018-1","first_seen_on":"2015-05-28T16:42:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1747-597X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy","last_mentioned_on":1443196709,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26013537?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26013537","pubdate":"2015-05-28T22:01:46+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Health Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology\/Toxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Social Policy","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Social Work","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"Screening and concurrent brief intervention of conjoint hazardous or harmful alcohol and tobacco use in hospital out-patients in Thailand: a randomized controlled trial.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/screening-concurrent-brief-intervention-conjoint-hazardous-harmful-alcohol-tobacco-hospital-outpatie"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6400456,"mean":5.856482612878,"rank":3015996,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1919556,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6400456,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":182610,"mean":8.8810780958223,"rank":103233,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":61344,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":182610,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279,"mean":5.6672302158273,"rank":211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":6.8666666666667,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
