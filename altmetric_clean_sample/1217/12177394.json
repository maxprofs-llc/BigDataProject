To resolve these problems associated with LF strips, we developed a novel surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based LF assay for the quantitative analysis of a specific biomarker in the low concentration range. Herein, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) DNA was chosen as the specific biomarker. Raman reporter-labeled gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were employed as SERS nano tags for targeting and detecting the HIV-1 DNA marker, as opposed to using bare AuNPs in LF strips. It was possible to quantitatively analyze HIV-1 DNA with high sensitivity by monitoring the characteristic Raman peak intensity of the DNA-conjugated AuNPs. Under optimized conditions, the detection limit of our SERS-based lateral flow assay was 0.24pg\/mL, which was at least 1000 times more sensitive compared to colorimetric or fluorescent detection methods. These results demonstrate the potential feasibility of the proposed SERS-based lateral flow assay to quantitatively detect a broad range of genetic diseases with high sensitivity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f7","authors":["Fu, Xiuli","Cheng, Ziyi","Yu, Jimin","Choo, Priscilla","Chen, Lingxin","Choo, Jaebum"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bios.2015.11.099","endpage":"537","first_seen_on":"2016-09-24T03:02:54+00:00","issns":["1873-4235","09565663"],"journal":"Biosensors & Bioelectronics","last_mentioned_on":1474686161,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26669705?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26669705","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"530","subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"A SERS-based lateral flow assay biosensor for highly sensitive detection of HIV-1 DNA","type":"article","volume":"78","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sersbased-lateral-flow-assay-biosensor-highly-sensitive-detection-hiv1-dna-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8425604,"mean":7.0878923279354,"rank":4500037,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2346448,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8425604,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253613,"mean":12.663836506159,"rank":139899,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":89606,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253613,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2097,"mean":2.8187108778626,"rank":755,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1059,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2097,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":152,"mean":2.067417218543,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":71,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":152,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
