Past studies have not accounted for pre-arrest factors such as chronic disease and medication.\nTo investigate whether the association between cardiac arrest in a private location and a higher mortality can be explained by differences in chronic diseases and medication.\nWe identified 27,771 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients \u226518 years old from the Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry (20012012). Using National Registries, we identified pre-arrest chronic disease and medication. To investigate the importance of cardiac arrest related factors and chronic disease and medication use we performed adjusted Cox regression analyses during day 0-7 and day 8-365 following cardiac arrest to calculate hazard ratios (HR) for death.\nDay 0-7: Un-adjusted HR for death day 0-7 was 1.21 (95%CI:1.18-1.25) in private compared to public location. When including cardiac arrest related factors HR for death was 1.09 (95%CI:1.06-1.12). Adding chronic disease and medication to the analysis changed HR for death to 1.08 (95%CI:1.05-1.12). 8-365\u2009day: The un-adjusted HR for death day 8-365 was 1.70 (95% CI: 1.43-2.02) in private compared to public location. When including cardiac arrest related factors the HR decreased to 1.39 (95% CI: 1.14-1.68). Adding chronic disease and medication to the analysis changed HR for death to 1.27 (95% CI:1.04-1.54).\nThe higher mortality following cardiac arrest in a private location is not fully explained by a higher prevalence of chronic disease and medication use in patients surviving until day 8.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003476","authors":["Asger Granfeldt","Mads Wissenberg","Steen M\u00f8ller Hansen","Freddy K.
