The comprehensive public healthcare services in Japan were provided by the cooperation of hospitals and public health nurses.\nThe nursing profession is exploring ways to identify and systemize nursing skills and competencies that address global health initiatives for sustainable development goals.\nThis paper is based on the summary of a symposium, (part of the 2015 annual meeting of the Japan Association for International Health) with panel members including experts from Japan's Official Development Assistance.\nThe evolving role of nurses in response to national and international needs is illustrated by nursing practices from Japan. Japanese public health nurses have also assisted overseas healthcare plans. In recent catastrophes, Japanese nurses assumed the roles of community health coordinators for restoration and maintenance of public health.\nThe Japanese experience shows that nursing professionals are best placed to work with community health issues, high-risk situations and vulnerable communities. Their cooperation can address current social needs and help global communities to transform our world.\nNurses have tremendous potential to make transformative changes in health and bring about the necessary paradigm shift. They must be involved in global sustainable development goals, health policies and disaster risk management. A mutual understanding of global citizen and nurses will help to renew and strengthen their capacities.\nNursing professionals can contribute effectively to achieve national and global health goals and make transformative changes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002bc5","authors":["Kanbara, S.","Yamamoto, Y.","Sugishita, T.","Nakasa, T.","Moriguchi, I."],"doi":"10.1111\/inr.12365","first_seen_on":"2017-03-15T14:29:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00208132","1466-7657"],"journal":"International Nursing Review","last_mentioned_on":1489448983,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/inr.12365\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/inr.12365\/pdf","pmid":"28261790","pubdate":"2017-03-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing"],"title":"Japanese experience of evolving nurses\u2019 roles in changing social contexts","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/inr.12365","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/japanese-experience-evolving-nurses-roles-changing-social-contexts"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8352366,"mean":7.0446264010179,"rank":7220332,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8352366,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242834,"mean":13.635230096403,"rank":201894,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242834,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284,"mean":2.4113992932862,"rank":276,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":3.0363636363636,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Other":1,"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":5,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Japanese experience of evolving nurses\u2019 roles in changing social contexts","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1914281905473933&id=1687098468192279","license":"public","citation_ids":[17383572,17383572],"posted_on":"2017-03-13T23:49:43+00:00","summary":"EpiNurses  are always exploring ways to identify and systemize nursing skills and competencies that address global health initiatives for sustainable development goals.\n\nPublished Now!\nS.
