Recently, the concept of multiple autoimmune syndrome has been introduced to describe patients with at least three autoimmune diseases. We describe a case of a young man with a clinical history of psychiatric symptoms and celiac disease (CD) who was diagnosed to have other two autoimmune disorders: systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. This case is unusual upon different patterns: the rare combination of the three autoimmune diseases, their appearance in a man and the atypical onset of the diseases with psychiatric symptoms likely to be related either to CD or to SLE.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006bb8","authors":["Viera Boccuti","Antonio Perrone","Alessia D\u2019Introno","Anna Campobasso","Moris Sangineto","Carlo Sabb\u00e0"],"doi":"10.1007\/s13317-016-0079-9","first_seen_on":"2016-07-08T10:06:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2038-3274","2038-0305"],"issue":"1","journal":"Autoimmunity Highlights","last_mentioned_on":1482166257,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs13317-016-0079-9","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s13317-016-0079-9","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4935668\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs13317-016-0079-9.pdf","pmcid":"PMC4935668","pmid":"27383232","pubdate":"2016-07-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"springer"}],"title":"An unusual association of three autoimmune disorders: celiac disease, systemic lupus erythematosus and Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/unusual-association-three-autoimmune-disorders-celiac-disease-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-hashimoto-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7909849,"mean":6.6937446400934,"rank":4148217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2205782,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7909849,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258408,"mean":11.480865448691,"rank":140847,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":91575,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258408,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":2.4338181818182,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Business, Management and Accounting":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/751134479553404929","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9326921],"posted_on":"2016-07-07T19:23:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":978},"tweet_id":"751134479553404929"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jaysreality91\/statuses\/753229897015955456","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9326921],"posted_on":"2016-07-13T14:09:36+00:00","author":{"name":"Jay M.
