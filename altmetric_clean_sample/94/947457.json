It comprises a repeated, cross-sectional, self-administered survey drawn from a representative sample of 7th to 9th grade students, performed in the school years 2003-2004 (GSHS-Lara 2004) and 2007-2008 (GSHS-Lara 2008). It explores, among other things, a general violence indicator such as school absenteeism due to feeling unsafe at school or on the way to or from school for any reason; and more specific indicators of violence such as robbery, bullying, physical fights and use of weapons, as well as exposure to lectures on how to prevent violence. Results are given in terms of prevalence percentage.\nAbsenteeism doubled between the two study periods (10.8% to 20.8%). The number of students that were a victim of robbery remained high and without change both outside (14.2% and 14.8%) and inside school (21.7% and 22.0%). The number of victims of bullying was high and increasing (33.4% and 43.6%). Bullying associated with being physically attacked decreased (18.5% to 14.3%). Physical attacks without active participation and not associated with bullying were frequent (21.5%). Physical fighting with active participation prevalence remained high and without change (27.5% and 28.2%). Carrying a weapon almost doubled (4.3% to 7.1%). Less than 65% reported classes for violence prevention.\nThe GSHS-Lara shows that violence is an important public health problem that needs to be addressed by the community and its authorities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007a2","authors":["Ricardo Granero","Esteban S Poni","Bertha C Escobar-Poni","Judith Escobar"],"doi":"10.1186\/0778-7367-69-7","first_seen_on":"2012-09-15T11:05:47+00:00","issns":["2049-3258"],"issue":"1","journal":"Archives of Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1347876149,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3436614\/?tool=pmcentrez"],"pmcid":"PMC3436614","pmid":"22958602","pubdate":"2012-09-15T20:11:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health\/Gesundheitswesen","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"7","title":"Trends of violence among 7th, 8th and 9th grade students in the state of Lara, Venezuela: The Global School Health Survey 2004 and 2008","type":"article","volume":"69","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/trends-violence-among-7th-8th-9th-grade-students-state-lara-venezuela-global-school-health-survey-20"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5030073,"mean":5.9653562811812,"rank":1903495,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":3108433,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5030073,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80985,"mean":5.725460387237,"rank":24389,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":56282,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80985,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150,"mean":4.162255033557,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":85,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":3.6845,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
