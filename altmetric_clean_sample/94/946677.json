Recent studies have found a suppression defect of CD4+CD25+(high) T cells in human disease. In this study we measure apoptosis of CD4+CD25+(high) T cells to see if it could contribute to reduced suppressive activity of these cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2007PLoSO...2..146G","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Glisic-Milosavljevic, Sanja","Waukau, Jill","Jailwala, Parthav","Jana, Srikanta","Khoo, Huoy-Jii","Albertz, Hope","Woodliff, Jeffrey","Koppen, Marilyn","Alemzadeh, Ramin","Hagopian, William","Ghosh, Soumitra"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0000146","first_seen_on":"2012-09-14T19:25:52+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"1","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1347321600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17206281"],"pmcid":"PMC1764033","pmid":"17206281","pubdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"At-risk and recent-onset type 1 diabetic subjects have increased apoptosis in the CD4+CD25+ T-cell fraction.","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/atrisk-recentonset-type-1-diabetic-subjects-increased-apoptosis-cd4-cd25-high-tcell-fraction"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3617832,"mean":4.9277809930899,"rank":2015540,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":925315,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3617832,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74894,"mean":5.1506737612327,"rank":35731,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":26548,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74894,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64021,"mean":8.3211830677913,"rank":35554,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":19346,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64021,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3549,"mean":5.7753263810597,"rank":1849,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":1336,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3549,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
