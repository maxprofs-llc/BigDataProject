Measurement of the myocardial extracellular volume fraction (ECV) circumvents factors that confound T1-weighted images or T1-maps. We hypothesized that quantitative assessment of myocardial ECV would be clinically useful for detecting both focal and diffuse myocardial abnormalities in a variety of common and uncommon heart diseases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52a3cf058f610003f90","doi":"10.1186\/1532-429x-14-64","first_seen_on":"2012-09-13T19:40:28+00:00","funders":["nhlbi"],"issns":["1532-429X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (Taylor & Francis Ltd)","last_mentioned_on":1347564843,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22967246?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"22967246","pubdate":"2012-09-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Angiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Imaging \/ Radiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["diagnosticimaging","cardiology"],"title":"Extracellular volume fraction mapping in the myocardium, part 2: initial clinical experience.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/extracellular-volume-fraction-mapping-myocardium-part-2-initial-clinical-experience"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628714,"mean":4.9390391673343,"rank":2902376,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":76911,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628714,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74925,"mean":5.1151081896322,"rank":55522,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":375,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74925,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":299,"mean":2.4634899328859,"rank":182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":299,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.5736842105263,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
