Microsatellite mutations often occur as insertion\/deletion of a repeat motif (unit-based indels), and increase in frequency with increasing repeat length after a threshold is reached. We recently demonstrated that DNA polymerase \u03ba (Pol \u03ba) produces fewer unit-based indel errors within dinucleotide microsatellites than does polymerase \u03b4. Here, we examined human Pol \u03ba's error profile within microsatellite alleles of varying sequence composition and length, using an in vitro HSV-tk gap-filling assay. We observed that Pol \u03ba displays relatively accurate synthesis for unit-based indels, using di- and tetranucleotide repeat templates longer than the threshold length. We observed an abrupt increase in the unit-based indel frequency when the total microsatellite length exceeds 28 nucleotides, suggesting that extended Pol \u03ba protein-DNA interactions enhance fidelity of the enzyme when synthesizing these microsatellite alleles. In contrast, Pol \u03ba is error-prone within the HSV-tk coding sequence, producing frequent single-base errors in a manner that is highly biased with regard to sequence context. Single-nucleotide errors are also created by Pol \u03ba within di- and tetranucleotide repeats, independently of the microsatellite allele length and at a frequency per nucleotide similar to the frequency of single base errors within the coding sequence. These single-base errors represent the mutational signature of Pol \u03ba, and we propose them a mechanism independent of homology-stabilized slippage. Pol \u03ba's dual fidelity nature provides a unique research tool to explore the distinct mechanisms of slippage-mediated mutagenesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f610006519","doi":"10.1002\/em.21721","first_seen_on":"2012-09-13T16:45:38+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["1098-2280"],"journal":"Environmental & Molecular Mutagenesis","last_mentioned_on":1347554693,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22965905?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22965905","pubdate":"2012-09-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","environmentalhealth"],"title":"DNA polymerase kappa microsatellite synthesis: Two distinct mechanisms of slippage-mediated errors.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dna-polymerase-kappa-microsatellite-synthesis-two-distinct-mechanisms-slippagemediated-errors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":3079361,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":959865,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78239,"mean":5.453409698612,"rank":50391,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":16456,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78239,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278,"mean":1.710476534296,"rank":196,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":5.9966666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
