Prominent recency and diminished primacy have consistently been observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We examined serial position effects in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), in patients with AD, and in normal healthy controls. Additionally, we classified MCI patients into those who progressed to AD (MCI-p) and those who did not (MCI-np). We compared two serial position measures: regional and standard scores. Regional scores, mainly the primacy effect, improved discrimination between MCI and controls and between MCI-np and MCI-p, proving to be more sensitive and specific than the recency effect.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f61000150b","authors":["Cunha C","Guerreiro M","de Mendon\u00e7a A","Oliveira PE","Santana I"],"doi":"10.1080\/13803395.2012.689814","first_seen_on":"2012-09-16T12:19:37+00:00","issns":["1380-3395"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology","last_mentioned_on":1347797971,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22731492"],"pmid":"22731492","pubdate":"2012-06-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Routledge","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychology","neurology"],"title":"Serial position effects in Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and normal aging: Predictive value for conversion to dementia.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/serial-position-effects-alzheimers-disease-mild-cognitive-impairment-normal-aging-predictive-value-c-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630432,"mean":4.9299514944696,"rank":2899584,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":79442,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630432,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69832,"mean":5.307204135699,"rank":51894,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":413,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69832,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":222,"mean":3.4251312217195,"rank":170,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":222,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":11.35,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
