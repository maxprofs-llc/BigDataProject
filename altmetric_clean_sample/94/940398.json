They prospectively show a dramatic difference in cancer progression between high-risk lesions (LOH) and low-risk (non-LOH) lesions (P = 0.002). This work has important implications for oral cancer prevention and risk modeling and for understanding genetic driver events in premalignancy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dd3","authors":["Webster K.
