The scale's psychometric properties and its relationship with people's willingness to vaccinate were examined in two studies. In Study 1, a representative sample of the German- and French-speaking populations in Switzerland (N=1123) responded to a mail survey. In Study 2, members of an online panel answered the same questions (N=233). The results of both studies suggest that people differ considerably in their ability to correctly answer questions related to vaccinations. Mokken scale analyses and a test-retest analysis showed that nine items form a one-dimensional scale with good psychometric properties. In both studies, a substantial correlation between knowledge and willingness to vaccinate was observed. The scale proposed in this study is well suited for research examining group differences. In a time when new media such as the Internet is highly accessible to most people, misconceptions can easily be spread. A good knowledge scale is important for measuring possible knowledge changes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036ea","authors":["Zingg, Alexandra","Siegrist, Michael"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.vaccine.2012.03.014","first_seen_on":"2012-09-13T18:46:07+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1873-2518"],"issue":"25","journal":"Vaccine","last_mentioned_on":1347565943,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22445808?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22445808","pubdate":"2012-05-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Veterinary","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Measuring people's knowledge about vaccination: developing a one-dimensional scale.","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/measuring-peoples-knowledge-about-vaccination-developing-onedimensional-scale"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":3078996,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":958787,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78240,"mean":5.4560579506385,"rank":50389,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":16404,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78240,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3180,"mean":4.8019572192513,"rank":2146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":665,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3180,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":2.6626590909091,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
