Such functionality is added along the main axis of the chromophore leading to single- and double-substituted derivatives. The relationship between the dye structure and the lasing properties is studied in detail with the help of the photophysical and electrochemical properties as well as quantum mechanical simulations. The asymmetric substitution of the parent dye induces inhomogeneities in the charge distribution, which leads to an overall loss of the fluorescence capacity, mainly in polar media. Such non-radiative deactivation processes can be softened by decreasing the electron-donor ability of the substituent or even avoided by symmetrical substitution. Thus, grafting of the arylethyne moieties at the longitudinal axis of the indacene core results in an effective strategy to develop red-edge BODIPYs with highly efficient and photostable laser emission.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008dda","authors":["Garc\u00eda\u2010Moreno, Inmaculada","Wang, Lu","Costela, Angel","Ba\u00f1uelos, Jorge","L\u00f3pez Arbeloa, I\u00f1igo","Xiao, Yi"],"doi":"10.1002\/cphc.201200587","endpage":"3931","first_seen_on":"2012-09-12T02:09:48+00:00","issns":["1439-7641","1439-4235"],"issue":"17","journal":"ChemPhysChem","last_mentioned_on":1347415750,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cphc.201200587\/abstract;jsessionid=F5D6E2CBFB2592A3F1354E08838FB4AE.d02t01?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+on+15+September+from+10%3A00-12%3A00+BST+%2805%3A00-07%3A00+EDT%29+for+essential+maintenance"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cphc.201200587\/pdf","pmid":"22969034","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u00e2\u0080\u0090VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
