While antibiotic therapy is commonly used in neonates with NEC symptoms and sepsis, it remains unknown how antibiotics may affect the intestine and NEC sensitivity. We hypothesized that broad-spectrum antibiotics, given immediately after preterm birth, would reduce NEC sensitivity and support intestinal protective mechanisms.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Pingping Jiang","Michael Ladegaard Jensen","Malene Skovsted Cilieborg","Thomas Thymann","Jennifer Man-Fan Wan","Wai-Hung Sit","George L.
