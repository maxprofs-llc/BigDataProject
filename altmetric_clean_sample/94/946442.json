Insulin resistance, one of the major components of type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is a known risk factor for AD. Insulin resistance increases amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) generation, but the exact mechanism underlying the linkage of insulin resistance to increased A\u03b2 generation in the brain is unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of insulin resistance on amyloid \u03b2 (A4) precursor protein (APP) processing in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD), and diabetic db\/db mice. We found that insulin resistance promotes A\u03b2 generation in the brain via altered insulin signal transduction, increased BACE1\/\u03b2-secretase and \u03b3-secretase activities, and accumulation of autophagosomes. Using an in vitro model of insulin resistance, we found that defects in insulin signal transduction affect autophagic flux by inhibiting the mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) pathway. The insulin resistance-induced autophagosome accumulation resulted in alteration of APP processing through enrichment of secretase proteins in autophagosomes. We speculate that the insulin resistance that underlies the pathogenesis of T2DM might alter APP processing through autophagy activation, which might be involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Therefore, we propose that insulin resistance-induced autophagosome accumulation becomes a potential linker between AD and T2DM.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006bbf","authors":["Inhee Mook-Jung"],"doi":"10.4161\/auto.21861","first_seen_on":"2012-09-14T17:28:51+00:00","issns":["1554-8627"],"journal":"Autophagy","last_mentioned_on":1347638340,"links":["http:\/\/www.landesbioscience.com\/journals\/autophagy\/article\/21861\/?nocache=1398744609"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.landesbioscience.com\/journals\/autophagy\/2012AUTO0378R.pdf","pmid":"22931791","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Landes Bioscience","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Accumulation of autophagosomes contributes to enhanced amyloidogenic APP processing under insulin-resistant conditions","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/accumulation-autophagosomes-contributes-enhanced-amyloidogenic-app-processing-under-insulinresistant"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627006,"mean":4.9509722374284,"rank":2907033,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":73354,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627006,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74944,"mean":5.1403493321591,"rank":55682,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":295,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74944,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":581,"mean":2.5396586206897,"rank":310,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":135,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":581,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":0.85652173913043,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Ph.
