The accurate prediction of flowering time in elite germplasm is important for decisions in maize breeding programs and best agronomic practices. The understanding of the genetic control of flowering time in maize has significantly advanced in the past decade. Through comparative genomics, mutant analysis, genetic analysis and QTL cloning, and transgenic approaches, more than 30 flowering time candidate genes in maize have been revealed and the relationships among these genes have been partially uncovered. Based on the knowledge of the flowering time candidate genes, a conceptual gene regulatory network model for the genetic control of flowering time in maize is proposed. To demonstrate the potential of the proposed gene regulatory network model, a first attempt was made to develop a dynamic gene network model to predict flowering time of maize genotypes varying for specific genes. The dynamic gene network model is composed of four genes and was built on the basis of gene expression dynamics of the two late flowering id1 and dlf1 mutants, the early flowering landrace Gaspe Flint and the temperate inbred B73. The model was evaluated against the phenotypic data of the id1 dlf1 double mutant and the ZMM4 overexpressed transgenic lines. The model provides a working example that leverages knowledge from model organisms for the utilization of maize genomic information to predict a whole plant trait phenotype, flowering time, of maize genotypes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Zhanshan Dong","Olga Danilevskaya","Tabare Abadie","Carlos Messina","Nathan Coles","Mark Cooper"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0043450","first_seen_on":"2012-09-13T03:31:02+00:00","issns":["1932-6203",""],"issue":"8","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1478559011,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0043450","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0043450"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0043450.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3422250","pmid":"22912876","pubdate":"2012-08-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e43450","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"A Gene Regulatory Network Model for Floral Transition of the Shoot Apex in Maize and Its Dynamic Modeling","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gene-regulatory-network-model-floral-transition-shoot-apex-maize-dynamic-modeling"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7659635,"mean":6.5812991774756,"rank":3199681,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4349401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7659635,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98153,"mean":5.743174117695,"rank":35551,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":60900,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98153,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108965,"mean":10.233904757535,"rank":45195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":60985,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108965,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3603,"mean":7.3955335924486,"rank":1345,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":2162,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3603,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":18,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
