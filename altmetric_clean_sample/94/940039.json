Wild animals serve as reservoirs for many viruses, which may occasionally result in novel infections of domestic animals and\/or the human population. Given this background, we used metagenomics to investigate the presence of viral pathogens in sera collected from bushpigs (Potamochoerus larvatus), a nocturnal species of wild Suid known to move between national parks and farmland, in Uganda.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008a9","authors":["Anne-Lie Blomstr\u00f6m","Karl St\u00e5hl","Charles Masembe","Edward Okoth","Ademun Rose Okurut","Patrick Atmnedi","Stephen Kemp","Richard Bishop","S\u00e1ndor Bel\u00e1k","Mikael Berg","Blomstr\u00f6m AL","St\u00e5hl K","Masembe C","Okoth E","Okurut AR","Atmnedi P","Kemp S","Bishop R","Belak S","Berg M","Blomstrom, A.L.","Stahl, K.","Masembe, C.","Okoth, E.","Okurut, A.R.","Atmnedi, P.","Kemp, S.J.","Bishop, R.P.","Belak, S.","Berg, M."],"doi":"10.1186\/1743-422x-9-192","first_seen_on":"2012-09-11T15:29:08+00:00","handle":"10568\/27701","handles":["10568\/27701"],"issns":["","1743-422X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Virology Journal","last_mentioned_on":1470904815,"links":["http:\/\/www.virologyj.com\/content\/9\/1\/192\/abstract","https:\/\/cgspace.cgiar.org\/handle\/10568\/27701","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/1743-422X-9-192","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/1743-422x-9-192"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/cgspace.cgiar.org\/bitstream\/10568\/27701\/1\/virologyJournal.jpg","pmid":"22967311","pubdate":"2012-09-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Virology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"192","title":"Viral metagenomic analysis of bushpigs ( Potamochoerus larvatus ) in Uganda identifies novel variants of Porcine parvovirus 4 and Torque teno sus virus 1 and 2","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/viral-metagenomic-analysis-bushpigs-potamochoerus-larvatus-uganda-identifies-novel-variants-porcine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8200733,"mean":6.9347145888862,"rank":4353296,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2277428,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8200733,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100818,"mean":5.9838663717429,"rank":50109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":38086,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100818,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1663,"mean":3.4948339350181,"rank":1011,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":479,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1663,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104,"mean":1.6549126213592,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
