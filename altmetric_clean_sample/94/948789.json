We also longitudinally investigated serum BDNF levels and plasma levels of catecholamine metabolite in the patient. Serum BDNF levels were increased and plasma levels of HVA and MHPG were decreased according to the recovery from the active phase of the disease. These results suggest that dysfunctions of catecholaminergic neurons and neurotrophic factors might exist in Sydenham's chorea, and the decreasing catecholamine activities in response to risperidone might be associated with the improvement of the disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53c3cf058f61000472c","authors":["Umene, Wakako","Yoshimura, Reiji","Hori, Hikaru","Nakano, Hideki","Sugita, Atsuko","Shimono, Masayuki","Takano, Kenchi","Shiota, Naoki","Tomoda, Yoshinori","Korogi, Yukunori","Nakamura, Jun"],"doi":"10.1080\/15622970701714354","first_seen_on":"2012-09-16T17:12:22+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1814-1412"],"issue":"3","journal":"World Journal of Biological Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1347885243,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17965987"],"pmid":"17965987","pubdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Blood levels of catecholamine metabolites and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in a case of Sydenham's chorea.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/blood-levels-catecholamine-metabolites-brainderived-neurotrophic-factor-case-sydenhams-chorea"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":1971566,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":2516997,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72971,"mean":5.6405282170755,"rank":27695,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":44875,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72971,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":293,"mean":3.4951917808219,"rank":109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":181,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":293,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.75,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
