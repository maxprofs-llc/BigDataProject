The author bases this paper on her experience as an expert witness in 28 sexual harassment cases over the last 10 years. She delineates the psychological and legal issues about which forensic psychiatrists may be consulted. These include issues related to helping a jury determine the veracity of the complaints of harassment, the psychological effects of the harassment, the prognosis, and the treatment for women who have been harassed. The author gives examples of cases where psychiatric testimony was given to help in the decision making about damages related to the psychological effects of sexual harassment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6f63cf058f61000a1a4","authors":["Binder, R L"],"first_seen_on":"2012-09-16T01:49:32+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0091-634X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Bulletin of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law","last_mentioned_on":1347763915,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1482795"],"pmid":"1482795","pubdate":"1992-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["psychiatry","jurisprudence"],"title":"Sexual harassment: issues for forensic psychiatrists.","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sexual-harassment-issues-forensic-psychiatrists"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4808539,"mean":5.7513002704793,"rank":1890084,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":2888752,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4808539,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74345,"mean":5.9208678037232,"rank":23656,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":50128,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74345,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":3.1972222222222,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1,"Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine":1,"Psychology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IS":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/braingarbage\/statuses\/247150156179460096","license":"public","citation_ids":[948200],"posted_on":"2012-09-16T01:49:23+00:00","author":{"name":"braingarbage","url":"http:\/\/braingarbagedystopie.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/802575989360316416\/PMlCBHMb_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"braingarbage","tweeter_id":"350772690","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1386},"tweet_id":"247150156179460096"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ashsultana\/statuses\/247150218141917185","license":"public","rt":["braingarbage"],"citation_ids":[948200],"posted_on":"2012-09-16T01:49:38+00:00","author":{"name":"Phoolan Devi","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/876550258427392001\/T6JyOaTP_normal.jpg","description":"I write and rage on racism.
