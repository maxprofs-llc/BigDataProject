Wilson's excellent article, pub. 2000"],"citation":{"abstract":"Biomedicine is improperly imbued with a nomothetic methodology, which views 'disease' in a similar way to other 'natural' phenomena. This arises from a 300-year history of a positivist domination of science, meaning that objectivist research (e.g. randomized controlled trials or biochemical research) attracts more funding and is more readily published than 'softer' qualitative research. A brief review of objectivism and subjectivism is followed by a definition of an emerging medical paradigm. Current 'inappropriate' medical practices become understandable in this broader context, and examples are given. A constructivist paradigm can continue to incorporate 'objective' clinical findings and interventions, as well as the recent evidence for the doctor-patient relationship as a major contributor to patient outcomes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"55c35c2e2a83ee85598b4567","authors":["Hamish J Wilson"],"doi":"10.1093\/fampra\/17.2.203","first_seen_on":"2012-09-12T02:02:06+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1460-2229","0263-2136"],"issue":"2","journal":"Family Practise","last_mentioned_on":1384213026,"links":["http:\/\/fampra.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/17\/2\/203.full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/fampra.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/17\/2\/203.full.pdf","pmid":"10758087","pubdate":"2000-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"scheme":"era","name":"Public Health And Health Services"}],"subjects":["primaryhealthcare"],"title":"The myth of objectivity: is medicine moving towards a social constructivist medical paradigm?","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/myth-objectivity-medicine-moving-towards-social-constructivist-medical-paradigm"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":1784683,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2641595,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78507,"mean":5.4785669885105,"rank":25872,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":51181,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78507,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":538,"mean":4.6197057728119,"rank":258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":270,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":538,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":14.4165,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
