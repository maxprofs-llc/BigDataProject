They are thought to play a significant role in the progression of cancer and are generally increased in patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Their number correlates with more aggressive disease status and is predictive of the time to treatment, as well. Moreover, it is now clear that dysregulation in Tregs cell frequency and\/or function may result in a plethora of autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune lymphoproliferative disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis. Efforts are made aiming to develop approaches to deplete Tregs or inhibit their function in cancer and autoimmune disorders, as well.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8203cf058f61000bc68","doi":"10.4084\/mjhid.2012.053","first_seen_on":"2012-09-14T11:58:23+00:00","issns":["2035-3006"],"issue":"1","journal":"Mediterranean Journal of Hematology and Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1347623896,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22973497"],"pmid":"22973497","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Regulatory T-Cells in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Autoimmune Diseases.","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/regulatory-tcells-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia-autoimmune-diseases-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5254331,"mean":6.1869196000274,"rank":3698036,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":880312,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5254331,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82289,"mean":5.7991548950029,"rank":53956,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":15155,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82289,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":5.688525,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
