A 19-year-old man underwent total proctocolectomy with an ileal J-pouch anal anastomosis and diverting ileostomy, after 2\u00a0years of ineffective medical treatment. On postoperative day 6, severe peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum developed and progressed rapidly. Maintaining immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids for 6\u00a0days induced melena from the gastroduodenal lesions and enteritis with concomitant CMV reactivation. The patient required a jejunostomy, after the duodenal and intestinal CMV lesions had caused multiple perforations. Treatment with intensive cytapheresis was ineffective against the associated UC lesions, which healed with infliximab induction. The CMV reactivation was treated effectively with ganciclovir. The patient is being maintained on infliximab every 8\u00a0weeks and there has been no sign of recurrence of the gastroduodenitis-associated UC and CMV reactivation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037d2","doi":"10.1007\/s00595-012-0329-z","first_seen_on":"2012-09-12T10:29:04+00:00","issns":["1436-2813"],"journal":"Surgery Today","last_mentioned_on":1347445702,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22965486?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22965486","pubdate":"2012-09-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Abdominal Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cardiac Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgical Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Thoracic Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Vascular Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Diffuse gastroduodenitis and enteritis associated with ulcerative colitis and concomitant cytomegalovirus reactivation after total colectomy: report of a case.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diffuse-gastroduodenitis-enteritis-associated-ulcerative-colitis-concomitant-cytomegalovirus-reactiv"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627464,"mean":4.9483847763613,"rank":2906209,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":74121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627464,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75175,"mean":5.1251825631202,"rank":55797,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":310,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75175,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300,"mean":1.2693913043478,"rank":132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":0.46190476190476,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
