Increasing interest has been centered on understanding the physiologic mechanisms underlying the effects of music and, more recently, the suggested role of music in modulating metabolic responses. Research has established a role for music in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, the sympathetic nervous system, and the immune system, which have key functions in the regulation of metabolism and energy balance. More recent findings have shown a role for music in the metabolic recovery from stress, the regulation of gastric and intestinal motility, the moderation of cancer-related gastrointestinal symptoms, and the increase of lipid metabolism and lactic acid clearance during exercise and postexercise recovery. The purpose of this article is to summarize the most current understanding of the mechanisms by which music affects the metabolic responses in the context of potential applications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5103cf058f610003215","authors":["Yamasaki A","Booker A","Kapur V","Tilt A","Niess H","Lillemoe KD","Warshaw AL","Conrad C","Alisa Yamasaki","Abigail Booker","Varun Kapur","Alexandra Tilt","Hanno Niess","Keith D.
