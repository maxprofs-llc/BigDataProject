Recent molecular phylogenetic studies have revealed that the actual number of species in South American tropical forests is largely underestimated, but also that many lineages are millions of years old. The genera Phyzelaphryne (1 sp.) and Adelophryne (6 spp.), which compose the subfamily Phyzelaphryninae, include poorly documented, secretive, and minute frogs with an unusual distribution pattern that encompasses the biotic disjunction between Amazonia and the Atlantic forest. We generated >5.8 kb sequence data from six markers for all seven nominal species of the subfamily as well as for newly discovered populations in order to (1) test the monophyly of Phyzelaphryninae, Adelophryne and Phyzelaphryne, (2) estimate species diversity within the subfamily, and (3) investigate their historical biogeography and diversification. Phylogenetic reconstruction confirmed the monophyly of each group and revealed deep subdivisions within Adelophryne and Phyzelaphryne, with three major clades in Adelophryne located in northern Amazonia, northern Atlantic forest and southern Atlantic forest. Our results suggest that the actual number of species in Phyzelaphryninae is, at least, twice the currently recognized species diversity, with almost every geographically isolated population representing an anciently divergent candidate species. Such results highlight the challenges for conservation, especially in the northern Atlantic forest where it is still degraded at a fast pace. Molecular dating revealed that Phyzelaphryninae originated in Amazonia and dispersed during early Miocene to the Atlantic forest. The two Atlantic forest clades of Adelophryne started to diversify some 7 Ma minimum, while the northern Amazonian Adelophryne diversified much earlier, some 13 Ma minimum. This striking biogeographic pattern coincides with major events that have shaped the face of the South American continent, as we know it today.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5083cf058f61000311a","authors":["Fouquet A","Loebmann D","Castroviejo-Fisher S","Padial JM","D Orrico VG","Lyra ML","Roberto IJ","R Kok PJ","B Haddad CF","Rodrigues MT"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ympev.2012.07.012","first_seen_on":"2012-09-13T00:27:16+00:00","issns":["1055-7903"],"journal":"Molecular Phylogenetics & Evolution","last_mentioned_on":1427622118,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1055790312002692","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ympev.2012.07.012"],"pmid":"22842094","pubdate":"2012-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biology"],"title":"From Amazonia to the Atlantic forest: Molecular phylogeny of Phyzelaphryninae frogs reveals unexpected diversity and a striking biogeographic pattern emphasizing conservation challenges.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/amazonia-atlantic-forest-molecular-phylogeny-phyzelaphryninae-frogs-reveals-unexpected-diversity-str"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4932811,"mean":5.8537829257602,"rank":1115346,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":3796745,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4932811,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80329,"mean":5.7126462254755,"rank":17363,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":62538,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80329,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1888,"mean":3.9838473767886,"rank":465,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":1400,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1888,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":2.581,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":25,"Researcher":23,"Student  > Ph.
