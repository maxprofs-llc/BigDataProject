Previous optical imaging studies demonstrated qualitatively that these classes of nanoparticles, called nanomicelles, preferentially accumulate at tumor sites in mice. The research reported herein describes the detailed quantitative imaging and biodistribution profiling of nanomicelles loaded with a cargo of paclitaxel.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f610007966","authors":["Wenwu Xiao","Juntao Luo","Teesta Jain","John W Riggs","Harry P Tseng","Paul T Henderson","Simon R Cherry","Douglas Rowland","Kit S Lam","Xiao W","Luo J","Jain T","Riggs JW","Tseng HP","Henderson PT","Cherry SR","Rowland D","Lam KS"],"doi":"10.2147\/ijn.s29306","first_seen_on":"2012-09-12T14:16:26+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1176-9114","1178-2013"],"journal":"International Journal of Nanomedicine","last_mentioned_on":1347382481,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3352867\/"],"pmid":"22605931","pubdate":"2012-09-12T20:12:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1587","subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of a telodendrimer micellar paclitaxel nanoformulation in a mouse xenograft model of ovarian cancer","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biodistribution-pharmacokinetics-telodendrimer-micellar-paclitaxel-nanoformulation-mouse-xenograft-m"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4014014,"mean":5.0326897912409,"rank":3210605,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":98877,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4014014,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76602,"mean":5.1615925379564,"rank":56875,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76602,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":980,"mean":2.3162165474974,"rank":834,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":980,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":1.3733333333333,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
