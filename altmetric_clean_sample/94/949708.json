Twelve trained men (age 19.7 \u00b1 1.23 years) underwent 2 weeks of supplementation with either betaine (B) (1.25 g BID) or placebo (P). Following a 2-week washout period, subjects underwent supplementation with the other treatment (B or P). Before and after each 2-week period, subjects performed an acute exercise session (AES). Circulating GH, IGF-1, cortisol, and insulin were measured. Vastus lateralis samples were analyzed for signaling proteins (Akt, p70 S6k, AMPK). B (vs. P) supplementation approached a significant increase in GH (mean \u00b1 SD (Area under the curve, AUC), B: 40.72 \u00b1 6.14, P: 38.28 \u00b1 5.54, p = 0.060) and significantly increased IGF-1 (mean \u00b1 SD (AUC), B: 106.19 \u00b1 13.45, P: 95.10 \u00b1 14.23, p = 0.010), but significantly decreased cortisol (mean \u00b1 SD (AUC), B: 1,079.18 \u00b1 110.02, P: 1,228.53 \u00b1 130.32, p = 0.007). There was no difference in insulin (AUC). B increased resting Total muscle Akt (p = 0.003). B potentiated phosphorylation (relative to P) of Akt (Ser(473)) and p70 S6 k (Thr(389)) (p = 0.016 and p = 0.005, respectively). Phosphorylation of AMPK (Thr(172)) decreased during both treatments (both p = 0.001). Betaine (vs. placebo) supplementation enhanced both the anabolic endocrine profile and the corresponding anabolic signaling environment, suggesting increased protein synthesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f61000733b","authors":["Apicella JM","Lee EC","Bailey BL","Saenz C","Anderson JM","Craig SA","Kraemer WJ","Volek JS","Maresh CM"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00421-012-2492-8","first_seen_on":"2012-09-17T12:42:38+00:00","issns":["1439-6319"],"issue":"","journal":"European Journal of Applied Physiology and Occupational Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1379775280,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22976217"],"pmid":"22976217","pubdate":"2012-09-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Physiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Occupational Medicine\/Industrial Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Sports Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Betaine supplementation enhances anabolic endocrine and Akt signaling in response to acute bouts of exercise.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/betaine-supplementation-enhances-anabolic-endocrine-akt-signaling-response-acute-bouts-exercise"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8021290,"mean":6.7878544007037,"rank":1713051,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":6251617,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8021290,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100926,"mean":5.8612277235571,"rank":20887,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":79342,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100926,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2174,"mean":8.8405080533824,"rank":760,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":1394,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2174,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":11.328146341463,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
