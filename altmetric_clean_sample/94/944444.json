We surveyed 133 Chinese students enrolled in three US universities. About 41.4\u00a0% believed that HIV could be contracted through mosquito bites, and 22.6\u00a0% were unaware that condoms could prevent HIV. Sources of HIV\/STI information were the mass media. Males were more likely to demonstrate a higher HIV\/AIDS knowledge level than females. Graduate students were more likely to cite television as a source of information, and less likely to mention school teachers, than were undergraduate students. These ethnic minority immigrant students held misconceptions about HIV transmission and prevention, and possibly utilized information of varying quality. Accordingly this study identifies specific objectives for education, including basic biology and diversity issues from evidence-based sources.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dee","doi":"10.1007\/s10903-012-9716-1","first_seen_on":"2012-09-13T18:41:46+00:00","issns":["1557-1920"],"journal":"Journal of Immigrant & Minority Health","last_mentioned_on":1366132335,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22965498"],"pmid":"22965498","pubdate":"2012-09-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health\/Gesundheitswesen","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Sociology, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth","socialsciences"],"title":"HIV\/AIDS Knowledge and Attitudes Among Chinese College Students in the US.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hivaids-knowledge-attitudes-among-chinese-college-students-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6351240,"mean":5.9815274440155,"rank":1378570,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":4970871,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6351240,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85808,"mean":5.8370366753295,"rank":19786,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":65978,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85808,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":477,"mean":2.8991638655462,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":404,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":477,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":2.4700869565217,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"AR":1,"GB":1,"LK":1},"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HIV_Insight\/statuses\/246317562772729857","license":"public","citation_ids":[944444],"posted_on":"2012-09-13T18:40:57+00:00","author":{"name":"HIV Insight","url":"http:\/\/hiv-insight.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/587408973\/INSIGHT_ICON_normal.gif","description":"HIV, AIDS, STI, STD, HPV, Sexuality, LGBT, et al.
