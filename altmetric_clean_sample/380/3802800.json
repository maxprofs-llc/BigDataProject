The inhibitory and facilitating effects of celecoxib on ion channels occur at low micromolar concentrations, bordering on therapeutic concentrations achievable in the clinical setting. The experiments described here were performed with the goals (1) to increase the range of ion channels tested, and (2) to examine possible differences in celecoxib's effects on channels from different species.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000798","authors":["Roman V Frolov","Satpal Singh"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13104-015-1023-1","first_seen_on":"2015-03-18T10:55:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1756-0500"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Research Notes","last_mentioned_on":1433151124,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25777226?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25889233?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4348164\/"],"pmid":"25777226","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","biology"],"title":"Evidence of more ion channels inhibited by celecoxib: KV1.3 and L-type Ca2+ channels","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evidence-more-ion-channels-inhibited-celecoxib-kv13-ltype-ca2-channels"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5174102,"mean":6.1057314111209,"rank":3417381,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1540133,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5174102,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":158707,"mean":10.150760878606,"rank":106250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":44847,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":158707,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1641,"mean":4.0268670731707,"rank":1035,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":529,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1641,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":5.9264186046512,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
