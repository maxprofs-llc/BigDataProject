The cumulative effect of these interactions has broad implications for biomolecular stability and recognition and determines the equilibrium distribution of the ensemble of conformations that are critical for function. Here, we accurately capture the stabilizing effects of weak CH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 interaction using an empirical molecular mechanics force field in excellent agreement with experiments. We show that the side chain of flanking C-terminal aromatic residues preferentially stabilize the cis isomer of the peptidyl-prolyl bond of the protein backbone through this weak interaction. Cis-trans isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl protein bond plays a pivotal role in many cellular processes, including signal transduction, substrate recognition, and many diseases. Although the cis isomer is relatively less stable than the trans isomer, aromatic side chains of neighboring residues can play a significant role in stabilizing the cis relative to the trans isomer. We carry out extensive regular and accelerated molecular dynamics simulations and establish an approach to simulate the pH profile of the cis\/trans ratio in order to probe the stabilizing role of the CH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 interaction. The results agree very well with NMR experiments, provide detailed atomistic description of this crucial biomolecular interaction, and underscore the importance of weak stabilizing interactions in protein function.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bcd","authors":["Arghya Barman","Bruce Batiste","Donald Hamelberg"],"doi":"10.1021\/ct501036r","first_seen_on":"2015-03-18T20:22:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1549-9618","1549-9626"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation","last_mentioned_on":1426715072,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ct501036r"],"pmid":"26574391","pubdate":"2015-03-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Theoretical And Computational Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Computer Science"],"startpage":"150318104932007","title":"Pushing the Limits of a Molecular Mechanics Force Field To Probe Weak CH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 Interactions in Proteins","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pushing-limits-molecular-mechanics-force-field-probe-weak-ch-interactions-proteins"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5028713,"mean":5.9653160399705,"rank":2481519,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2395451,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5028713,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155483,"mean":10.137638376147,"rank":80124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":68653,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155483,"percentile":44},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2580,"mean":1.2532531989143,"rank":491,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":1915,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2580,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":137,"mean":1.3466029411765,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":86,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":137,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":26,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
