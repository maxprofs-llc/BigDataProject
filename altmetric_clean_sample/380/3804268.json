We previously observed that IGFBP7 was one of several genes found significantly upregulated in an EOC cell line model rendered non-tumourigenic as consequence of genetic manipulation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of IGFBP7 in high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSC), the most common type of EOC.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008b0","authors":["Gambaro, Karen","Quinn, Michael Cj","C\u00e1ceres-Gorriti, Katia Y","Shapiro, Rebecca S","Provencher, Diane","Rahimi, Kurosh","Mes-Masson, Anne-Marie","Tonin, Patricia N"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12885-015-1138-8","first_seen_on":"2015-03-18T17:18:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-2407"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1429353428,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2407\/15\/135\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25784117?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25886299?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/s12885-015-1138-8.pdf","pmid":"25784117","pubdate":"2015-03-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"135","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Low levels of IGFBP7 expression in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma is associated with patient outcome.","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/low-levels-igfbp7-expression-highgrade-serous-ovarian-carcinoma-associated-patient-outcome-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7188283,"mean":6.3195409473331,"rank":5154166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1779632,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7188283,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":204446,"mean":9.088056934628,"rank":129791,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":62668,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":204446,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3207,"mean":3.2995708047411,"rank":1786,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3207,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":135,"mean":3.9166119402985,"rank":93,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":135,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Lecturer":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Sports and Recreations":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/LguzzardiM\/status\/578244122487701504","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3804268],"posted_on":"2015-03-18T17:18:36+00:00","author":{"name":"Lisa M Guzzardi, RN","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/420494918068983\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643272867124264960\/10aQ8fO0_normal.jpg","description":"#HBOC #PatientAdvocate dedicated to providing up to date evidence based research for 2.7 K 'SoMe' consumers @ risk & clinicians #JournalClub #bcsm #gyncsm #BRCA","id_on_source":"LguzzardiM","tweeter_id":"2432381543","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":5607},"tweet_id":"578244122487701504"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/epigen_papers\/status\/578558934765568001","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3804268],"posted_on":"2015-03-19T14:09:33+00:00","author":{"name":"epigenetics_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Epigenetics","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/471205704921931776\/wSQqKYz8_normal.jpeg","description":"Chromatin & epigenetics paper feed from #Pubmed and #Arxiv - hear it here first!
