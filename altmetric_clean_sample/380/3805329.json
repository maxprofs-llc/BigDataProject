We observed significant effects of APOE \u03b54 on A\u03b2(42) levels in both diagnostic groups by disease stage and region. In contrast, we did not observe a significant effect of APOE \u03b54 on PHF-\u03c4 levels by disease stage in any region. Levels of A\u03b2(42) and PHF-\u03c4 in cerebral cortex were correlated more strongly in the Dementia group, and these measures had independent explanatory power for dementia beyond those of standard neuropathologic indices. Associations between Lewy body disease and A\u03b2(42) or PHF-\u03c4 levels and between A\u03b2(42) levels and microvascular brain injury suggested that these comorbid diseases enhanced the penetrance of Alzheimer disease. Our novel approach brings additional insights into the molecular pathogenesis of common causes of dementia and may serve as a platform for future studies pursuing associations between molecular changes in Alzheimer disease and genetic or environmental risk.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d95","authors":["Postupna N","Keene CD","Crane PK","Gonzalez-Cuyar LF","Sonnen JA","Hewitt J","Rice S","Howard K","Montine KS","Larson EB","Montine TJ","Nadia Postupna","Christopher Dirk Keene","Paul K.
