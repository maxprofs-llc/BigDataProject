The latter species has been proposed as a potential predator of L. laeta. For this research, we studied the interaction between both species during individual encounters to assess the possibility of population regulation of L. laeta cohorts exposed to this potential predator. We found that in most encounters S. globula prevailed. Also, S. globula preys on spiderlings of L. laeta, with a population effect on cohorts of this species. These findings suggest that S. globula may be influencing L. laeta populations in central Chile. The population regulation of L. laeta by predation would be important because this species, in the absence of predators, has a high reproductive rate, and it can maintain populations of large size. However according to our results, although S. globula may aid in the reduction of both spiderling and adult L. laeta populations, and perhaps other Loxosceles species, it is insufficient for biological control of Loxosceles species. Its presence together with other control measures such as hygiene of the rooms can help to decrease loxoscelism incidence.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006651","authors":["Mauricio Canals","Nicol\u00e1s Arriagada","Rigoberto Sol\u00eds"],"doi":"10.1093\/jme\/tju021","first_seen_on":"2015-03-18T22:33:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1938-2928","0022-2585"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Medical Entomology","last_mentioned_on":1426239420,"links":["http:\/\/jme.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/52\/2\/109"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jme.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/52\/2\/109.full.pdf","pmid":"26336293","pubdate":"2015-09-04T22:00:13+00:00","publisher":"The Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Veterinary","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Interactions Between the Chilean Recluse Spider (Araneae: Sicariidae) and an Araneophagic Spitting Spider (Araneae: Scytodidae)","type":"article","volume":"52","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interactions-between-chilean-recluse-spider-araneae-sicariidae-araneophagic-spitting-spider-araneae"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4866695,"mean":5.796527301289,"rank":1008403,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":3826638,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4866695,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":151883,"mean":10.074608946419,"rank":43415,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":108028,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":151883,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":652,"mean":8.4280921658986,"rank":144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":505,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":652,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":4.9007777777778,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Environmental Science":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"CL":1}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Spider bites and necrosis!","url":"http:\/\/www.earthtimes.org\/health\/spider-bites-necrosis\/2850\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[3805152],"posted_on":"2015-03-13T09:37:00+00:00","summary":"Many considerations should determine how we approach health issues, pests and even bites we think we have.
