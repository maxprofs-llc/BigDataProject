Up-regulated HDAC (Histone Deacetylase) enzyme activity is associated with a closed chromatin assembly and subsequent gene repression, forming a characteristic feature of malignantly transformed cells. Novel therapeutics are now targeting the zinc containing HDAC enzymes for treating various types of cancers. Recently a spate of drugs acting via HDAC inhibition have been undergoing clinical trials and several patents present exciting molecules like PCI-24781 (Abexinostat), ITF-2357 (Givinostat);MS-275 (Entinostat),MGCD 0103(Mocetinostat), LBH-589(Panobinostat),FK228 (Romidepsin), PXD-101 (Belinostat) and Valproic Acid to be used as alternatives or adjuvants to traditional chemotherapeutics. However, only three HDAC inhibitors have acquired FDA approval till date. Recently, PXD-101 obtained FDA approval for the treatment of Refractory or Relapsed Peripheral T cell lymphoma. The current article reviews patents that have introduced novel molecules that are HDAC isoform specific, superior to first generation HDAC inhibitors like SAHA (Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid) and TSA (Trichostatin A) and can be modified structurally to reduce toxic side effects and increase specificity. These molecules can combine the best characteristics of an ideal HDAC inhibiting drug either as monotherapy or in combinatorial therapy for cancer treatment thus indicating promise to be included in the next generation of target specific HDAC inhibiting drugs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5323cf058f610004474","authors":["Cristabelle De Souza","Biswa Prasun Chatterji"],"first_seen_on":"2015-03-19T16:15:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2212-3970"],"journal":"Recent Patents on Anti-Cancer Drug Discovery","last_mentioned_on":1426781704,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25782916?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25782916","pubdate":"2015-03-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms","pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"HDAC Inhibitors as Novel Anti-Cancer Therapeutics.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hdac-inhibitors-novel-anticancer-therapeutics-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4892514,"mean":5.8196715086924,"rank":4092795,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4892514,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146136,"mean":10.227573462894,"rank":121920,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146136,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":1.3571739130435,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
