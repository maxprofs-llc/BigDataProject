In a prospective, multicenter study, 307 knees with minimum 2-year follow-up were first divided into groups based on 2-year functional performance. Logistic regression then determined SF-36 General Health Score (GHS) to be the most predictive preoperative patient characteristic. Subsequently, a second analysis was performed using preoperative SF-36 GHS to stratify patients into groups. Statistical significance was achieved in both analyses by gender, BMI and hypertension. Statistical significance was achieved in a single analysis by age, preoperative narcotic use, preoperative metabolic medication usage, preoperative pulmonary disease and preoperative use of medication for anxiety or depression.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6203cf058f610007b79","authors":["Roth JS","Buehler KC","Shen J","Naughton M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.arth.2013.01.009","first_seen_on":"2015-03-18T21:26:18+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"The Journal of Arthroplasty","last_mentioned_on":1380251425,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23523205\/"],"pmid":"23523205","pubdate":"2013-03-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Patient Factors Predict Functional Outcomes After Cruciate Retaining TKA: A 2-Year Follow-Up Analysis.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/patient-factors-predict-functional-outcomes-after-cruciate-retaining-tka-2year-followup-analysis-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628371,"mean":4.9417862081361,"rank":2903852,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75807,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628371,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64754,"mean":8.4098639445277,"rank":52457,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":295,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64754,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":449,"mean":1.7236160714286,"rank":373,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":449,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.7888888888889,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
