However topology of promoter-associated H3.3 in relation to chromatin modifications and transcriptional outcome is not known, providing no insight on any distinction between H3.3-containing active and inactive promoters. Here, we report algorithms providing information on gene expression status as a function of density and position of multiple chromatin marks on promoters. We identify a relationship between promoter enrichment in epitope-tagged H3.3 or its canonical isoform H3.2 and corresponding transcriptional outcomes, as a function of sub-promoter positioning of DNA methylation and H3K4me3, H3K9me3 and H3K27me3. We identify a low-frequency configuration of H3.3 and H3K9me3 co-occupancy associated with transcriptional activity, while H3.3 and H3K27me3 promoters are invariably inactive. We unveil H3.3 and DNA methylated promoters whose transcription outcome depends on H3.3 sub-promoter positioning. Our results indicate how spatially restricted positioning of H3.3 may add another layer of transcription regulation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","authors":["Eivind G Lund","Philippe Collas","Erwan Delbarre"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbrc.2015.03.037","first_seen_on":"2015-03-19T13:21:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1090-2104","0006291X"],"journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1427174436,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25783056?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0006291X15004726"],"pmid":"25783056","pubdate":"2015-03-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Transcription outcome of promoters enriched in histone variant H3.3 defined by positioning of H3.3 and local chromatin marks ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transcription-outcome-promoters-enriched-histone-variant-h33-defined-positioning-h33-local-chromatin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4912897,"mean":5.8425670606536,"rank":3280365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1436428,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4912897,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146664,"mean":10.27984891895,"rank":100044,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":39755,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146664,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6836,"mean":2.4936822238478,"rank":5366,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":1355,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6836,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147,"mean":2.0987671232877,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":68,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
