A survey was carried out amongst CTs using questionnaires to obtain their background social-occupational demographics and observation methods to study their work performance, use of scissors and any cumulative trauma disorder (CTD) in their hands. Thicknesses of various fabrics were measured and comparison between Western world's custom tailoring job and the Nigerian type was done. The results showed some CTD risk factors with finger contusions on the 71 CTs evaluated. The right-hand contusions were traced to the constant usage of unpadded manual scissors with ungloved hands. Disparity between Western and Nigerian tailoring practice may account for the high occurrence of disorders in Nigerian CTs. Since hand dimensions are crucial in the design of hand tools, it is therefore concluded that hand anthropometry of Nigerian CTs and soft padding of manual scissors may mitigate CTD burdens on CTs' hands.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d73cf058f610001232","authors":["Adedoyin Abiodun Adeleye"],"doi":"10.1080\/00140139.2015.1012123","first_seen_on":"2015-03-18T16:29:48+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Ergonomics","last_mentioned_on":1426698265,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/00140139.2015.1012123"],"pmid":"25679401","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Design Practice And Management","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"title":"Hand cumulative trauma disorders in Nigerian custom tailors: the need for redesign of manual scissors","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hand-cumulative-trauma-disorders-nigerian-custom-tailors-need-redesign-manual-scissors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4888304,"mean":5.8155820430968,"rank":2375908,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2464476,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4888304,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":152142,"mean":10.063726622015,"rank":77322,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":73354,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":152142,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":614,"mean":3.9127145187602,"rank":322,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":268,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":614,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":4.8283333333333,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
