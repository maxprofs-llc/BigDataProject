All estimated loci were very polymorphic indicated by high values of polymorphism information content (from 0.76 in S0225 to 0.92 in Sw2410). Indigenous populations had very high level of genetic diversity (mean He = 0.75); of all indigenous breeds, Lung Pu showed highest mean number of alleles (MNA = 10.1), gene diversity (He = 0.82), allele richness (5.33) and number of private alleles (10). Thirteen percentage of the total genetic variation observed was due to differences among populations. The neighbour-joining dendrogram obtained from Nei's standard genetic distance differentiated eight populations into four groups including Yorkshire, two wild populations, Mong Cai population and a group of four other indigenous populations. The Bayesian clustering with the admixture model implemented in Structure 2.1 indicated seven possible homogenous clusters among eight populations. From 79% (Ha Lang) to 98% (Mong Cai). individuals in indigenous pigs were assigned to their own populations. The results confirmed high level of genetic diversity and shed a new light on genetic structure of Vietnam indigenous pig populations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c83","authors":["Pham, L.D.","Do, D.N.","Nam, L.Q.","Van Ba, N.","Minh, L.T.A.","Hoan, T.X.","Cuong, V.C.","Kadarmideen, H.N."],"doi":"10.1111\/jbg.12068","endpage":"386","first_seen_on":"2015-03-17T22:20:27+00:00","issns":["1439-0388","0931-2668"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Animal Breeding & Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1395570622,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jbg.12068\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jbg.12068\/pdf","pmid":"24373066","pubdate":"2013-12-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"379","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Molecular genetic diversity and genetic structure of Vietnamese indigenous pig populations","type":"article","volume":"131","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-genetic-diversity-genetic-structure-vietnamese-indigenous-pig-populations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6357417,"mean":5.9829340420698,"rank":5413647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6357417,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169323,"mean":9.930708555297,"rank":138722,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169323,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":139,"mean":2.1786956521739,"rank":118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":139,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.63888888888889,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":5,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Molecular genetic diversity and genetic structure of Vietnamese indigenous pig populations -...","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=743454839012714&id=101646596636299","license":"public","citation_ids":[3800600],"posted_on":"2014-03-23T10:30:22+00:00","summary":"Want to find out more information on Animal Science, check up  our researchers in the article bellow\nhttp:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jbg.12068\/abstract","author":{"name":"National Institute of Animal Sciences, Vietnam","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/101646596636299","facebook_wall_name":"National Institute of Animal Sciences, Vietnam","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/101646596636299\/picture","id_on_source":"101646596636299"}}]}}
