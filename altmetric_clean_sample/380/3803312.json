Plasmodium falciparum CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (PfCCT) is the rate-limiting enzyme of the phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis pathway and thus considered as a potential antimalarial target. In contrast to its mammalian orthologs, PfCCT contains a duplicated catalytic domain. Here, we show that both domains are catalytically active with similar kinetic parameters. A virtual screening strategy allowed the identification of a drug-size molecule competitively inhibiting the enzyme. This compound also prevented phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis in parasites and exerted an antimalarial effect. This study constitutes the first step towards a rationalized design of future new antimalarial agents targeting PfCCT.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028b7","authors":["Alicia Contet","Emilie Pihan","Marina Lavigne","Kai Wengelnik","Sweta Maheshwari","Henri Vial","Dominique Douguet","Rachel Cerdan"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.febslet.2015.03.003","first_seen_on":"2015-03-18T13:01:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-3468"],"journal":"Febs Letters","last_mentioned_on":1426683606,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25771858?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25771858","pubdate":"2015-03-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Plasmodium falciparum CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase possesses two functional catalytic domains and is inhibited by a CDP-choline analog selected from a virtual screening.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/plasmodium-falciparum-ctpphosphocholine-cytidylyltransferase-possesses-two-functional-catalytic-doma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4888368,"mean":5.8147322424886,"rank":2593752,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1633930,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4888368,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":152130,"mean":10.066386803305,"rank":86392,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":49034,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":152130,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3501,"mean":2.7543754285714,"rank":2737,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":491,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3501,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":1.5454545454545,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
