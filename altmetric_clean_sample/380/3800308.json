It is a dominant fouling species and thus a major target organism in antifouling research. Here, the first high-throughput proteomic profiling of pre-competent and competent larvae of H. elegans is reported with the identification of 1,519 and 1,322 proteins, respectively. These proteins were associated with a variety of biological processes. However, a large proportion was involved in energy metabolism, redox homeostasis, and microtubule-based processes. A comparative analysis revealed 21 proteins that were differentially regulated in larvae approaching competency.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d73cf058f610001226","authors":["Yu Zhang","Zhang Y","Sun J","Zhang H","Chandramouli KH","Xu Y","He LS","Ravasi T","Qian PY"],"doi":"10.1080\/08927014.2014.951341","first_seen_on":"2015-03-17T20:18:58+00:00","issns":["0892-7014"],"journal":"Biofouling","last_mentioned_on":1432807628,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/08927014.2014.951341#tabModule","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25237770?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25237770","pubdate":"2014-09-04T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Proteomic profiling during the pre-competent to competent transition of the biofouling polychaete Hydroides elegans.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/proteomic-profiling-during-precompetent-competent-transition-biofouling-polychaete-hydroides-elegans"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5160020,"mean":6.0977055057378,"rank":3623737,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":869666,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5160020,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":158927,"mean":10.120610384707,"rank":113936,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":26912,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":158927,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":247,"mean":1.8525203252033,"rank":126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":61,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":247,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.15625,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
