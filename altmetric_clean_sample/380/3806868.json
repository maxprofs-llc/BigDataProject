Patients with methylmalonic aciduria develop a variety of skin manifestations: superficial scalded skin lesions, alopecia, psoriasiform eruptions, acrodermatitis enteropathica-like lesions, fulminant ecthyma gangrenosum and ichthyosis. We report a Japanese boy, diagnosed with methylmalonic aciduria, who suffered from recurrent multiple molluscum lesions around the eyes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bbfd","authors":["Motonobu Nakamura"],"doi":"10.4161\/derm.2.2.13503","first_seen_on":"2015-03-19T06:07:49+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Dermato-Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1416180240,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.4161\/derm.2.2.13503#.VF6jFIcnhUQ"],"pmid":"21547100","title":" \tMethylmalonic aciduria presenting with recurrent multiple molluscum contagiosum lesions ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/methylmalonic-aciduria-presenting-recurrent-multiple-molluscum-contagiosum-lesions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4510149,"mean":5.2636614770391,"rank":3648595,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":147025,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4510149,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":134033,"mean":10.254310746688,"rank":109101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":2837,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":134033,"percentile":2},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105,"mean":5.4873846153846,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
