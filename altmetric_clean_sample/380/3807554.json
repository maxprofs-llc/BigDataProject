Although there is no clinically proven vaccine or treatment for Ebola virus infection, a virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine is effective in mice, guinea pigs, and non-human primates when given pre-infection. In this work, we report that VLPs protect Ebola virus-infected mice when given 24 hours post-infection. Analysis of cytokine expression in serum revealed a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels in mice given VLPs post-exposure compared to infected, untreated mice. Using knockout mice, we show that VLP-mediated post-exposure protection requires perforin, B cells, macrophages, conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), and either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells. Protection was Ebola virus-specific, as marburgvirus VLPs did not protect Ebola virus-infected mice. Increased antibody production in VLP-treated mice correlated with protection, and macrophages were required for this increased production. However, NK cells, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha were not required for post-exposure-mediated protection. These data suggest that a non-replicating Ebola virus vaccine can provide post-exposure protection and that the mechanisms of immune protection in this setting require both increased antibody production and generation of cytotoxic T cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Steven B Bradfute","Scott M Anthony","Kelly S Stuthman","Natarajan Ayithan","Prafullakumar Tailor","Carl I Shaia","Mike Bray","Keiko Ozato","Sina Bavari"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0118434","first_seen_on":"2015-03-19T10:10:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"3","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1456515846,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25785602?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25785602?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25785602","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Mechanisms of Immunity in Post-Exposure Vaccination against Ebola Virus Infection.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mechanisms-immunity-postexposure-vaccination-against-ebola-virus-infection"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8421960,"mean":7.0860234078473,"rank":3557285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4810898,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8421960,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":204176,"mean":9.4785424268397,"rank":77146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":124802,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":204176,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116133,"mean":10.652838718011,"rank":46655,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":67704,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116133,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4462,"mean":10.99307868191,"rank":1884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":2495,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4462,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
