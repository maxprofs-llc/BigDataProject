More specifically, data on the safety of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) in pregnancy still remain limited. Therefore, pregnant women from Choma, Zambia, who were exposed to artemether-lumefantrine (AL) for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria were followed up and evaluated in a prospective cohort study. This report assessed the longitudinal safety outcomes of the pregnant women inadvertently exposed during the first trimester.\nParticipants were classified based on the drug used to treat their most recent malaria episode: artemether-lumefantrine (AL) versus sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) and\/or quinine. All enrolled women were followed up until six weeks post-delivery and the live births for 12\u00a0months.\nThere were 294 first trimester exposures in the observational cohort (pregnant women: AL\u2009=\u2009150, AL and SP\u2009=\u20099 and SP and\/or quinine\u2009=\u2009135). Similar rates of perinatal mortality (stillbirths and neonatal deaths) were observed for each treatment arm (AL 4.4%, SP and\/or quinine 3.9%). At delivery (newborns: AL\u2009=\u2009135, AL and SP\u2009=\u20097 and SP and\/or quinine\u2009=\u2009129), the gestational age (measured using the Dubowitz total scores), length and head circumference of the newborns were similar between the two arms. Low birth weights were reported in 10.2% (95% CI 6.0, 16.6) and 6.7% (95% CI 3.4, 12.6) of newborns in the AL and SP and\/or quinine arms, respectively. Overall development (including neurodevelopmental parameters) was similar between the two arms, both at 14\u00a0weeks and 12\u00a0months of age.\nExposure to AL and SP in the first trimester was not associated with particular safety risks such as perinatal mortality, preterm deliveries or low birth weights. Such outcomes as well as infant neurodevelopmental parameters up to 12\u00a0months were similar between the two arms. These findings add to the body of data suggesting that randomized clinical trials could now be the way forward to assess safety and efficacy of ACT in the first trimester of pregnancy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000086b","authors":["Manyando, Christine","Njunju, Eric M","Virtanen, Mailis","Hamed, Kamal","Gomes, Melba","Van Geertruyden, Jean-Pierre","Christine Manyando","Eric M Njunju","Mailis Virtanen","Kamal Hamed","Melba Gomes","Jean-Pierre Van geertruyden"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12936-015-0578-6","first_seen_on":"2015-03-19T14:45:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1475-2875"],"issue":"1","journal":"Malaria Journal","last_mentioned_on":1426777267,"links":["http:\/\/www.malariajournal.com\/content\/14\/1\/77","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/s12936-015-0578-6"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.malariajournal.com\/content\/pdf\/s12936-015-0578-6.pdf","pmcid":"PMC4336694","pmid":"25877884","pubdate":"2015-02-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Parasitology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Tropical Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"77","title":"Exposure to artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem\u00ae) in first trimester pregnancy in an observational study in Zambia","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exposure-artemetherlumefantrine-coartem-first-trimester-pregnancy-observational-study-zambia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4892661,"mean":5.8194423569203,"rank":2378050,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2466617,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4892661,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146149,"mean":10.229066932151,"rank":74884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":69848,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146149,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1933,"mean":3.8587795031056,"rank":1128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":769,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1933,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112,"mean":3.8702522522523,"rank":74,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
