We used nationally representative data from the 2008 Sierra Leone Demographic and Health Survey. The primary outcome was HIV testing (past 12\u00a0months). Our explanatory variable was HIV stigmatizing attitudes (5-item scale). After multivariable adjustment, HIV testing had an inverse association with HIV stigmatizing attitudes measured at the individual [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.94; 95\u00a0% CI 0.87-1.01] and community level (AOR 0.70; 95\u00a0% CI 0.58-0.85). HIV stigma had a stronger negative association with HIV testing when modeled at the community rather than individual level.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f6100056e0","authors":["J Daniel Kelly","Sheri D Weiser","Alexander C Tsai"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10461-015-1035-9","first_seen_on":"2015-03-18T11:37:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-3254"],"journal":"AIDS & Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1426678656,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25771909"],"pmid":"25771909","pubdate":"2015-03-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Health Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome","behavioralsciences"],"title":"Proximate Context of HIV Stigma and Its Association with HIV Testing in Sierra Leone: A Population-Based Study.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/proximate-context-hiv-stigma-association-hiv-testing-sierra-leone-populationbased-study-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4888304,"mean":5.8155820430968,"rank":3459121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":799065,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4888304,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":152126,"mean":10.064634557108,"rank":110465,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":25535,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":152126,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1126,"mean":4.08352,"rank":956,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":84,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1126,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":4.7873142857143,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
