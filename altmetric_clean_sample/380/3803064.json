A total of 27 children and adolescents from ages 6 to 15 years admitted to the Pediatric Hematology and Oncology ward of an Italian hospital participated in the study. Each participant was asked to talk about an emotional experience of happiness, anger, sadness and fear, felt in the presence of a doctor or nurse on the ward. The emotional tales were coded and analyzed qualitatively. The results showed that all the emotions considered were experienced when the staff was present, nurses in particular. Doctors and nurses played a role of active participants, encouraging children's emotions, especially for happy events. More research is needed to clarify the role of the staff in supporting children to cope with negative emotions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a0a","authors":["Paola Corsano","Ada Cigala","Marinella Majorano","Valentina Vignola","Maria Jos\u00e8 Nuzzo","Elisa Cardinale","Giancarlo Izzi"],"doi":"10.1177\/1367493513496912","endpage":"92","first_seen_on":"2015-03-18T11:48:13+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1741-2889","1367-4935"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Child Health Care","last_mentioned_on":1429606279,"links":["http:\/\/chc.sagepub.com\/content\/19\/1\/84.abstract","http:\/\/chc.sagepub.com\/content\/19\/1\/84.full.pdf+html?hootPostID=291db81d3726bbb5b249f143d2bd4246&ijkey=exT9WTRFGkeSI&keytype=ref&siteid=spchc","http:\/\/chc.sagepub.com\/content\/19\/1\/84.full.pdf+html?hootPostID=91f4f73c4ca9fbd407dc71654a73aa38&ijkey=exT9WTRFGkeSI&keytype=ref&siteid=spchc","http:\/\/m.chc.sagepub.com\/content\/19\/1\/84"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/chc.sagepub.com\/content\/19\/1\/84.full.pdf","pmid":"23908370","pubdate":"2013-07-31T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"84","subjects":["nursing","pediatrics"],"title":"Speaking about emotional events in hospital: The role of health-care professionals in children emotional experiences.","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/speaking-about-emotional-events-hospital-role-healthcare-professionals-children-emotional-experience"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6233565,"mean":5.9732399693036,"rank":995746,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5235272,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6233565,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161806,"mean":10.177923166775,"rank":39049,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":122628,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161806,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":205,"mean":2.897637254902,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":174,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":205,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":4.41,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":4,"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Neuroscience":1,"Psychology":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":5,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":2,"US":1,"SE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JournalofCHC\/status\/578165052710232064","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3803064],"posted_on":"2015-03-18T12:04:25+00:00","author":{"name":"JoChildHealthCare","url":"http:\/\/chc.sagepub.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/900379506363576320\/ZzJw5gAh_normal.jpg","description":"Journal of Child Health Care aims to address child health issues from a multi-disciplinary perspective.Opinions are the team's; retweets do not mean endorsement","id_on_source":"JournalofCHC","tweeter_id":"2180228930","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":485},"tweet_id":"578165052710232064"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/LindaMilnes_UOL\/status\/578167043326873600","license":"datasift","rt":["JournalofCHC"],"citation_ids":[3803064],"posted_on":"2015-03-18T12:12:19+00:00","author":{"name":"Linda Milnes","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/888710929864642560\/45tuIyOs_normal.jpg","description":"Associate Professor in Children and Young People's Nursing, researcher in child health.
