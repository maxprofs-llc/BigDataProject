A\u03b2 oligomers block the induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in rodents. The activation of Wnt signaling prevents A\u03b2 oligomer-induced neurotoxic effects. The compound WASP-1 (Wnt-activating small molecule potentiator-1), has been described as a synergist of the ligand Wnt-3a, enhancing the activation of Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin signaling. Herein, we report that WASP-1 administration successfully rescued A\u03b2-induced synaptic impairments both in vitro and in vivo. The activation of canonical Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin signaling by WASP-1 increased synaptic transmission and rescued hippocampal LTP impairments induced by A\u03b2 oligomers. Additionally, intra-hippocampal administration of WASP-1 to the double transgenic APPswe\/PS1dE9 mouse model of AD prevented synaptic protein loss and reduced tau phosphorylation levels. Moreover, we found that WASP-1 blocked A\u03b2 aggregation in vitro and reduced pathological tau phosphorylation in vivo. These results indicate that targeting canonical Wnt signaling with WASP-1 could have value for treating AD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002897","authors":["Vargas JY","Ahumada J","Arr\u00e1zola MS","Fuenzalida M","Inestrosa NC"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.expneurol.2014.11.005","endpage":"25","first_seen_on":"2015-03-18T16:03:10+00:00","issns":["00144886","0014-4886"],"journal":"Experimental Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1418170353,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0014488614003653"],"pmid":"25450465","pubdate":"2014-11-20T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"14","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"WASP-1, a canonical Wnt signaling potentiator, rescues hippocampal synaptic impairments induced by A\u03b2 oligomers ","type":"article","volume":"264","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/wasp1-canonical-wnt-signaling-potentiator-rescues-hippocampal-synaptic-impairments-induced-oligomers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4600266,"mean":5.4093239416989,"rank":3728158,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":142057,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4600266,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":140821,"mean":10.189066609857,"rank":114541,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2794,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":140821,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":852,"mean":2.9744324324324,"rank":688,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":852,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":2.4737222222222,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
