Separation\/extraction methods must be employed for the isolation of target species at relevant concentrations. Micropipette tips packed with capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fibers are employed for the solid phase extraction of proteins from a synthetic and a certified urine matrix.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f61000864a","authors":["Manard, Benjamin T.","Jones, Sarah M.
