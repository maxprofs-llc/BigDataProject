The highest levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and nitrate, the stable metabolite of NO, were found during the first day after inclusion and gradually declined thereafter. Detectable levels of IL-10, TNFsrI and TNFsrII were present in all patients at study entry but did not significantly change during the study period [analysis of variance (MANOVA); P > 0.05]. Serum nitrate levels correlated significantly with both pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha) as well as anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TNFsrI, TNFsrII). Serum nitrate levels over time were higher in patients with positive blood cultures (n = 4) (MANOVA; P < 0.005), as compared to patients without proven bacteraemia. These data support the concept of an acute phase of sepsis that is characterized by an excess of pro-inflammatory cytokines, while anti-inflammatory cytokines are predominantly present during the secondary phase. The present findings indicate that pro-inflammatory cytokines are related to the induction of excessive NO production during the first phase of sepsis and that reduction of NO production occurs during the secondary phase. This may suggest that anti-inflammatory cytokines are able to diminish the production of NO in patients with severe sepsis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c4","authors":["P H Groeneveld","K M Kwappenberg","J A Langermans","P H Nibbering","L Curtis"],"doi":"10.1006\/cyto.1996.0147","first_seen_on":"2015-03-17T20:07:25+00:00","issns":["1043-4666"],"issue":"2","journal":"Cytokine","last_mentioned_on":1426622825,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9071565"],"pmid":"9071565","pubdate":"1997-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Relation between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and the production of nitric oxide (NO) in severe sepsis.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/relation-between-pro-antiinflammatory-cytokines-production-nitric-oxide-severe-sepsis-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4883123,"mean":5.8139014224937,"rank":4085421,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4883123,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":152447,"mean":10.044361150834,"rank":126807,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":152447,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":655,"mean":1.6675993883792,"rank":444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":655,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":0.74387755102041,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
