In September 2013, 12\u2009months after the change, there were an estimated additional 116 (37.3% [17.2-67.4]) child and 426 (12.5% [4.5-19.6]) adult admissions. Thus in the year before the change (Sept 2011-Aug 2012) there were 45,181 (3,500 child: 41,681 adult), and in the year after (Sept 2012-Aug 2013) there were 50,198 admissions (4,779 child: 45,419 adult). The overall proportion of child admissions was significantly greater after the change (Chi squared 32.486, p\u2009<\u20090.001), emphasising the disproportionate effect in children.\nChanges to the management guidelines for paracetamol poisoning in September 2012 were rapidly implemented, but have particularly increased paediatric hospital admissions for paracetamol poisoning. This impact in children, who are at low risk of mortality from paracetamol toxicity appears excessive.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000243e","authors":["Narayan, Hafid","Thomas, Simon H L","Eddleston, Michael","Dear, James W","Sandilands, Euan","Bateman, D Nicholas","Hafid Narayan","Simon HL.
