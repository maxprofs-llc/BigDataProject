Ligands exhibit Npy^S\/Se bidentate coordination whereas shows an Npy^Npz bidentate coordination mode in their corresponding neutral palladium complexes. Abstraction of chloride in neutral palladium complexes with NaBAr4 (BAr4 = tetrakis[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)-phenyl]borate) resulted in the formation of the cationic palladium complexes , in which adopt a tridentate Npz^Npy^X (X = S or Se) coordination mode in their respective cationic palladium complexes () whilst in complex adopts a Npy^Npz bidentate coordination mode and the palladium centre is stabilized by the weakly coordinating acetonitrile. Compounds readily undergo CO insertion into the Pd-CH3 bond to form Pd-acyl that determines their ability to catalyse CO\/ethylene copolymerisation to polyketones.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Kamlesh Kumar","James Darkwa"],"doi":"10.1039\/c5dt03929k","endpage":"20727","first_seen_on":"2015-10-27T13:30:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1477-9234"],"issue":"47","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1445952633,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2015\/DT\/C5DT03929K?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=inorganicnews"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2015\/dt\/c5dt03929k","pmid":"26568064","pubdate":"2015-10-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"20714","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Effect of chalcogens on CO insertion into the palladium-methyl bond of [(N^N^X)Pd(CH3)]+ (X = O, S, Se) and on CO\/ethylene copolymerisation","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-chalcogens-co-insertion-palladiummethyl-bond-nnxpdch-sub3sub-supsup-x-o-s-se-coethylene-copol"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6496325,"mean":6.0089414145595,"rank":5540665,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6496325,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208492,"mean":10.254079523816,"rank":165797,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208492,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9915,"mean":0.64914363526326,"rank":2741,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9915,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":702,"mean":0.60485021398003,"rank":238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":702,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
