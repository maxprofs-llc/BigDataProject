However, the role of IL-32 on inflammatory disease has been doubtful according to diverse conflicting results. This study was designed to examine the role of IL-32\u03b2 on the development of collagen antibody (CAIA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory arthritis. Our data showed that the paw swelling volume and clinical score were significantly reduced in the CAIA and LPS-treated IL-32\u03b2 transgenic mice compared with non-transgenic mice. The populations of cytotoxic T, NK and dendritic cells was inhibited and NF-\u03baB and STAT3 activities were significantly lowered in the CAIA and LPS-treated IL-32\u03b2 transgenic mice. The expression of pro-inflammatory proteins was prevented in the paw tissues of CAIA and LPS-treated IL-32\u03b2 transgenic mice. In addition, IL-32\u03b2 altered several cytokine levels in the blood, spleen and paw joint. Our data indicates that IL-32\u03b2 comprehensively inhibits the inflammation responses in the CAIA and LPS-induced inflammatory arthritis model.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Park, Mi Hee","Yoon, Do-Young","Ban, Jung Ok","Kim, Dae Hwan","Lee, Dong Hun","Song, Sukgil","Kim, Youngsoo","Han, Sang-Bae","Lee, Hee Pom","Hong, Jin Tae"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.6160","first_seen_on":"2015-10-27T10:16:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"issue":"36","journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1445978073,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26497686?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26497686?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4770721","pmid":"26497686","pubdate":"2015-10-27T22:01:59+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Decrease severity of collagen antibody and lipopolysacchride-induced arthritis in human IL-32\u03b2 overexpressed transgenic mice.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/decreased-severity-collagen-antibody-lipopolysaccharideinduced-arthritis-human-il32beta-overexpresse"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6496325,"mean":6.0089414145595,"rank":2873367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3448577,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6496325,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208492,"mean":10.254115544556,"rank":101386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":98312,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208492,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6009,"mean":1.9615765645806,"rank":1217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":4353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6009,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":892,"mean":1.3881795735129,"rank":186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":617,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":892,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
