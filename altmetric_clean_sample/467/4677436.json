These characteristics make them reservoirs for a large number species, mainly microorganisms. Bacteria of the genus Vibrio are natural inhabitants of these environments and their presence is determined by variations in the nutrient, temperature and salinity cycles generated by the seasonal hydrologic behavior of these lagoon systems. This study determined the diversity of the genus Vibrio in 4 coastal bodies of water on the Yucatan Peninsula (Celestun Lagoon, Chelem Lagoon, Rosada Lagoon and Sabancuy Estuary). Using the molecular technique of 454 pyrosequencing, DNA extracted from water samples was analyzed and 32,807 reads were obtained belonging to over 20 culturable species of the genus Vibrio and related genera. OTU (operational taxonomic unit) richness and Chao2 and Shannon Weaver diversity indices were obtained with the database from this technique. Physicochemical and environmental parameters were determined and correlated with Vibrio diversity measured in OTUs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Icela Ortiz-Carrillo","Neyi Elo\u00edsa Estrella-G\u00f3mez","Marcela Zamudio-Maya","Rafael Rojas-Herrera"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0134953","first_seen_on":"2015-10-27T06:16:24+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"8","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1427241600,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0134953"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0134953.PDF","pmid":"26252792","pubdate":"2015-08-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0134953","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Diversity of Vibrio spp in Karstic Coastal Marshes in the Yucatan Peninsula","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diversity-vibrio-spp-karstic-coastal-marshes-yucatan-peninsula"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4912353,"mean":5.8425122279539,"rank":2607395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1641959,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4912353,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186505,"mean":9.953322781281,"rank":99071,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":68307,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186505,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86785,"mean":9.1722044616519,"rank":49744,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":26795,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86785,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5410,"mean":8.5040166389351,"rank":3162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1738,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5410,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
