Cepharanthine, a natural plant alkaloid, possesses anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties. We elucidated the salutary effects of cepharanthine against muscle and kidney injuries following limb I\/R. Adult male rats were randomized to receive I\/R or I\/R plus cepharanthine. I\/R was achieved by applying tourniquet high around each thigh for 3 hours followed by reperfusion for 24 hours. Cepharanthine (10\u2009mg\/kg, intraperitoneal) was injected immediately before reperfusion. After euthanization, degrees of tissue injury, inflammation, and oxidation were examined. Our data revealed that the I\/R group had significant increases in injury biomarker concentrations of muscle (creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase) and kidney (creatinine, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and kidney injury molecule-1). Histological assays revealed moderate muscle and kidney injury characteristics in the I\/R group. The I\/R group also had significant increases in concentrations of inflammatory molecules (interleukin-6, macrophage inflammatory protein-2, and prostaglandin E2) and reactive nitrogen species (nitric oxide) as well as lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde). Of note, these effects of limb I\/R could be mitigated by cepharanthine. These data confirmed that cepharanthine attenuated muscle and kidney injuries induced by limb I\/R. The mechanisms may involve its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative capacities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5243cf058f610003c64","authors":["Kao, Ming-Chang"],"doi":"10.1155\/2015\/504061","first_seen_on":"2015-10-26T08:04:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1741-427X"],"journal":"Evidence-based Complementary & Alternative Medicine (eCAM)","last_mentioned_on":1445847068,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2015\/504061\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2015\/504061.pdf","pmid":"26587045","pubdate":"2015-10-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Salutary Effects of Cepharanthine against Skeletal Muscle and Kidney Injuries following Limb Ischemia\/Reperfusion","type":"article","volume":"2015","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/salutary-effects-cepharanthine-against-skeletal-muscle-kidney-injuries-following-limb-ischemiareperf"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6491271,"mean":5.9704270061169,"rank":3035443,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3431151,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6491271,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208027,"mean":10.081321517503,"rank":108375,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":98428,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208027,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3520,"mean":4.1749371980676,"rank":1453,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":2010,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3520,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":154,"mean":2.3635947712418,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":82,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":154,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Chemistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MBHolistic\/statuses\/658554839606034432","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4673890],"posted_on":"2015-10-26T08:04:43+00:00","author":{"name":"Monterey Holistic","url":"http:\/\/www.montereybayholistic.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/793206537254686724\/_c1aiyQP_normal.jpg","description":"501(c)3 #health #education #exercise #healthnews #nutrition #holistic #fitness #wellness #inspirational #healing #success #quotes #yoga #chiropractic #fitness","id_on_source":"MBHolistic","tweeter_id":"28173797","geo":{"lt":37.25022,"ln":-119.75126,"country":"US"},"followers":28297},"tweet_id":"658554839606034432"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/tomorrowsman\/statuses\/658556454006341632","license":"gnip","rt":["MBHolistic"],"citation_ids":[4673890],"posted_on":"2015-10-26T08:11:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Guys Health&Success","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/596358181493813248\/exYMTr3L_normal.png","description":"Join us to discover the best in health, fitness, nutrition, success, money, lifestyle and advice for the #Winning Alpha Male!","id_on_source":"tomorrowsman","tweeter_id":"3240235546","geo":{"lt":"40.7305991","ln":"-73.9865812","country":"US"},"followers":8458},"tweet_id":"658556454006341632"}]}}
