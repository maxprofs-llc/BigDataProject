The concentrations of 24(S)-HC in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and\/or plasma might be a sensitive marker of altered cholesterol metabolism in central nervous system. A highly sensitive two-dimensional liquid-chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS) assay was developed for the quantification of 24(S)-HC in human plasma and CSF. In the development of an assay for 24(S)-HC in CSF, significant non-specific binding of 24(S)-HC was observed and resolved with addition of 2.5% 2-hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b2-CD) into CSF samples. The sample preparation consists of liquid-liquid extraction with methyl-tert-butyl ether and derivatization with nicotinic acid. Good linearity was observed in a range from 1 to 200 ng\/ml and from 0.025 to 5 ng\/ml, for plasma and CSF, respectively. Acceptable precision and accuracy were obtained for concentrations over the calibration curve ranges. Stability of 24(S)-HC was reported under a variety of storage conditions. This method has been successfully applied to support a NIH sponsored clinical trial of HP-\u03b2-CD in Niemann-Pick type C1 patients, in which 24(S)-HC is used as a pharmacodynamic biomarker.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007d1d","authors":["Rohini Sidhu","Hui Jiang","Nicole Y.
