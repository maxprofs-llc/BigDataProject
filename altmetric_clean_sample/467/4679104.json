In four randomized, double-blind, clinical trials, oral vilazodone 20 or 40\u00a0mg once daily for 8 or 10\u00a0weeks reduced from baseline (improved) the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score significantly more than placebo in adult patients with MDD. In these trials, significantly greater reductions in MADRS total score with vilazodone compared with placebo were seen from either week 1, week 2 (two trials) or week 6. In a noncomparative study, MADRS total scores continued to improve throughout therapy for up to 1\u00a0year. Vilazodone was generally well tolerated, with the most common treatment-emergent adverse events being mild or moderate diarrhoea, nausea and headache. Vilazodone had only limited adverse effects on sexual function or bodyweight. Therefore, vilazodone is an effective agent for treating MDD in adults.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002738","authors":["McCormack, Paul L"],"doi":"10.1007\/s40265-015-0490-y","endpage":"1923","first_seen_on":"2015-10-27T12:04:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0012-6667","1179-1950"],"issue":"16","journal":"Drugs","last_mentioned_on":1474371817,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26496736?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s40265-015-0490-y","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26496736?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26496736","pubdate":"2015-10-27T22:02:25+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology\/Toxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1915","subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Vilazodone: A Review in Major Depressive Disorder in Adults","type":"article","volume":"75","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vilazodone-review-major-depressive-disorder-adults"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":4180884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":4164075,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":247081,"mean":9.7972330095515,"rank":114902,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":129927,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":247081,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1484,"mean":3.5232002697235,"rank":1028,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1484,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":2.2223684210526,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Psychology":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"ES":1},"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/658977617828167680","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4679104],"posted_on":"2015-10-27T12:04:41+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":974},"tweet_id":"658977617828167680"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RevistaMFSamfyc\/statuses\/672506233128157184","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4679104],"posted_on":"2015-12-03T20:02:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Revista MFAndalucia","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2159845648\/logo_BUENO_RevistaRGB_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"RevistaMFSamfyc","tweeter_id":"559316806","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":499},"tweet_id":"672506233128157184"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/amango30\/statuses\/672523157677457408","license":"gnip","rt":["RevistaMFSamfyc"],"citation_ids":[4679104],"posted_on":"2015-12-03T21:09:50+00:00","author":{"name":"Antonio Manteca","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000095310075\/e3761435f8f78dcd6c84ed7f7c2c8ac3_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"amango30","tweeter_id":"332317568","geo":{"lt":36.77262,"ln":-4.10045,"country":"ES"},"followers":101},"tweet_id":"672523157677457408"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/778197920407355392","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4679104],"posted_on":"2016-09-20T11:43:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":974},"tweet_id":"778197920407355392"}]}}
