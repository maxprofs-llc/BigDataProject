The aim of the study was to investigate the mechanisms of thalidomide stimulating effect on erythroid differentiation.\nHematopoietic stem cells were isolated from bone marrow aspirates taken from myeloma patients and cultured with or without thalidomide. Then the generation of erythroid cells and the expression of STAT5, GATA-1, GATA-2, selected caspases and Bcl-2 family proteins in erythroid cells were assessed using flow cytometry and real-time PCR.\nThe generation of erythroblasts was higher in thalidomide than in control cultures (63.9% vs. 55.8%, p<0.001). The expression of caspase 3 (cytometry 947.3 vs. 1021.0, p=0.025; PCR 12.9 vs. 16.3, p=0.025) and caspase 8 (cytometry 1050.8 vs. 1168.5, p=0.033; PCR 16.2 vs. 17.8, p=0.004) was significantly lower in thalidomide than in control cultures. The expression of STAT5 (cytometry 331.5 vs. 276.1, p=0.015; PCR 24.3 vs. 21.1, p=0.003) and GATA-1 (cytometry 259.7 vs. 232.0, p=0.027; PCR 18.9 vs. 16.5, p=0.003) was higher in thalidomide than in control cultures.\nOur results suggest that thalidomide enhances expression of STAT5 in response of erythroid cells to erythropoietin and as a result of caspase 3 suppression. Moreover it may exert inhibitory effect on an external pathway of caspases activation with consequent decreased degradation of GATA-1 transcription factor by downstream caspases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f6100084db","authors":["Grzasko, Norbert","Chocholska, Sylwia","Goracy, Aneta","Hus, Marek","Dmoszynska, Anna"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pharep.2015.05.011","endpage":"1200","first_seen_on":"2015-10-24T16:33:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1734-1140","17341140"],"issue":"6","journal":"Pharmacological Reports","last_mentioned_on":1473770765,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26481541?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26481541?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26481541","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"1193","subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Thalidomide can promote erythropoiesis by induction of STAT5 and repression of external pathway of apoptosis resulting in increased expression of GATA-1 transcription factor.","type":"article","volume":"67","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/thalidomide-promote-erythropoiesis-induction-stat5-repression-external-pathway-apoptosis-resulting-i"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372629,"mean":7.0578283965246,"rank":6054389,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2018803,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372629,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246166,"mean":9.7282478256453,"rank":152638,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":77842,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246166,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":433,"mean":1.8964861111111,"rank":191,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":433,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":1.1038461538462,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/sean_tiernan\/statuses\/657958012586360832","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4670401],"posted_on":"2015-10-24T16:33:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Sean Tiernan","url":"http:\/\/mylifewithmyeloma.blogspot.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1552303712\/Sean_G__normal.png","description":"Professional Photographer covering portraiture, fashion, glamour and product photography.
