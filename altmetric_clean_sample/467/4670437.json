The substrates are thin sheets of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) coated with crosslinked polymer multilayers that present hydroxyl groups suitable for conventional phosphoramidite-based nucleic acid synthesis. We demonstrate that by modifying MAS procedures to accommodate the physical and chemical properties of these materials, it is possible to synthesize plastic-backed oligonucleotide arrays with feature sizes as small as 14 x 14 \u03bcm and feature densities in excess of 125 000\/cm2, similar to specifications attainable using rigid substrates such as glass or glassy carbon. These plastic-backed arrays are tolerant to a wide range of hybridization temperatures, and improved synthetic procedures are described that enable the fabrication of arrays with sequences up to 50 nucleotides in length. These arrays hybridize with S\/N ratios comparable to those fabricated on otherwise identical arrays prepared on glass or glassy carbon. This platform supports the enzymatic synthesis of RNA arrays and proof-of-concept experiments are presented showing that the arrays can be readily sub-divided into smaller arrays (or 'millichips') using common laboratory-scale laser cutting tools. These results expand the utility of oligonucleotide arrays fabricated on plastic substrates and open the door to new potential applications for these important bioanalytical tools.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224e","authors":["Holden, Matthew Taylor","Carter, Matthew C D","Wu, Cheng-Hsien","Wolfer, Jamison","Codner, Eric","Sussman, Michael R","Lynn, David M","Smith, Lloyd M"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.analchem.5b02893","first_seen_on":"2015-10-24T16:55:59+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms"],"issns":["1520-6882"],"journal":"Analytical Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1446777568,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26494264?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/10.1021\/acs.analchem.5b02893"],"pmid":"26494264","pubdate":"2015-10-24T22:00:32+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Photolithographic Synthesis of High-Density DNA and RNA Arrays on Flexible, Transparent, and Easily Subdivided Plastic Substrates","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/photolithographic-synthesis-highdensity-dna-rna-arrays-flexible-transparent-easily-subdivided-plasti"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6535212,"mean":6.0548114281224,"rank":2523494,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3933853,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6535212,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":209044,"mean":10.208701071072,"rank":85596,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":120457,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":209044,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5910,"mean":3.1519729226603,"rank":1802,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":3983,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5910,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118,"mean":5.4744615384615,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":73,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
