Confirmatory factor analyses tested specific hypotheses regarding the latent structure of substance misuse for a comprehensive battery of 13 misuse symptoms measured across six illicit substance categories (78 items).\nAmong the models fit, the latent structure of substance misuse was best represented by a combination of substance-specific factors and misuse symptom-specific factors. We found no support for a general liability factor to illicit substance misuse.\nResults indicate that liability to misuse illicit substances is drug class specific, with little evidence for a general liability factor. Additionally, unique dimensions capturing propensity toward specific misuse symptoms (e.g., tolerance, withdrawal) across substances were identified. While this finding requires independent replication, the possibility of symptom-specific misuse factors, present in multiple substances, raises the prospect of genetic, neurobiological and behavioral predispositions toward distinct, narrowly defined features of drug abuse and dependence.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002176","authors":["Clark, Shaunna L","Gillespie, Nathan A","Adkins, Daniel E","Kendler, Kenneth S","Neale, Michael C"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.addbeh.2015.10.015","first_seen_on":"2015-10-24T14:33:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["03064603","1873-6327"],"journal":"Addictive Behaviors","last_mentioned_on":1445734577,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0306460315300447","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0306460315300447&_version=1&md5=d1a242845bef7588bddf9e11f760358d"],"pmid":"26517709","pubdate":"2015-10-31T22:00:10+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Social Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Psychology"],"title":"Psychometric modeling of abuse and dependence symptoms across six illicit substances indicates novel dimensions of misuse ","type":"article","volume":"53","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/psychometric-modeling-abuse-dependence-symptoms-across-six-illicit-substances-indicates-novel-dimens"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6447265,"mean":5.9812925678238,"rank":4529918,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1682385,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6447265,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":206921,"mean":10.020327160255,"rank":130559,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":66316,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":206921,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1413,"mean":5.4310722379603,"rank":956,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":386,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1413,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":15.069518518519,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
