Comparative cost analyses for available strategies are lacking.\n\u2003To determine cost-effectiveness of community-based testing strategies, we evaluated annual costs of three algorithms that detect AHI [based on HIV nucleic-acid-amplification testing ( EARLYTEST: -algorithm), or HIV p24 antigen (Ag) detection via Architect ( ARCHITECT: -algorithm), or Determine ( DETERMINE: -algorithm)], and one algorithm that relies on HIV antibody-testing alone ( ANTIBODY: -algorithm). The cost model used data in men who have sex with men (MSM) undergoing community-based AHI screening in San Diego. Incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICER) per diagnosis of AHI were calculated for programs with HIV prevalence rates between 0.1% and 2.9%.\n\u2003Among MSM in San Diego, the EARLYTEST: -algorithm was cost-saving (i.e. ICERs per AHI diagnosis below $13.000) when compared to the three other algorithms. Cost-analyses relative to regional HIV prevalence showed that the EARLYTEST: -algorithm was cost-effective (i.e. ICERs below $69.547) for similar populations of MSM with an HIV prevalence rate of >0.4%; ARCHITECT: was be the second best alternative for HIV prevalence rates of >0.6%.\n\u2003Identification of acute HIV infection by the dual EARLYTEST: screening algorithm is likely to be cost-effective not only among at risk MSM in San Diego, but also among other similar populations of MSM with HIV prevalence rates of greater than 0.4%.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000255e","authors":["Martin Hoenigl","Joshua Graff-Zivin","Susan J.
