Current robotic surgical systems are useful for single-site cholecystectomy. However, in exposing Calot's triangle, the gallbladder is usually retracted in a medial and upward direction, resulting in a narrow triangle. This intraoperative view is a major obstacle to safe laparoscopic cholecystectomy.From October 2013 to October 2014, 55 consecutive patients underwent SSRC by a single surgeon at Yonsei University Severance Hospital. Initially, 5 patients underwent the original robotic single site cholecystectomy technique, and the remaining 50 patients underwent robotic single site cholecystectomy using our reverse port technique.There were no differences between the SSRC-O (original port) group and the SSRC-R (reverse port) group in terms of patient age (P\u200a=\u200a0.244), body mass index (P\u200a=\u200a0.503), and pathologic conditions of the gallbladder (P\u200a=\u200a0.841). Total operation time (132.6 vs 99.12 min; P\u200a=\u200a0.009), actual dissection time (51.6 vs 30.28 min; P\u200a=\u200a0.001), and console time (84.4 vs 50.46 min; P\u200a=\u200a0.001) were all significantly shorter in the SSRC-R group. Mean intraoperative blood loss was minimal in both groups (20 vs 12.4 mL, P\u200a=\u200a0.467), and bile spillage occurred in 2 patients of the SSRC-R group. There was one case of laparoscopic conversion in the SSRC-R group.The reverse port technique described in this study successfully widened Calot's triangle and improved the safety of the current robotic surgical system for single-site robotic cholecystectomy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b27","authors":["Jung, Myung Jae","Lee, So Young","Lee, Sung Hwan","Kang, Chang Moo","Lee, Woo Jung"],"doi":"10.1097\/md.0000000000001871","first_seen_on":"2015-10-27T10:25:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1536-5964","0025-7974"],"issue":"42","journal":"Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1461924077,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26496344?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26496344","pubdate":"2015-10-27T22:02:32+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Single-Site Robotic Cholecystectomy: Reverse-Port Technique.","type":"article","volume":"94"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7625034,"mean":6.5623772256419,"rank":6600096,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7625034,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241904,"mean":9.5925210435587,"rank":201004,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241904,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3723,"mean":2.930612573885,"rank":2914,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3723,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":348,"mean":2.215469740634,"rank":272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":348,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/statuses\/658952427991756800","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4678491],"posted_on":"2015-10-27T10:24:36+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":371},"tweet_id":"658952427991756800"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/statuses\/725988316835811328","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4678491],"posted_on":"2016-04-29T10:01:17+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":371},"tweet_id":"725988316835811328"}]}}
