Excessive intake of palatable food is thought to be driven by hedonic, rather than energy homeostatic, mechanisms. However, reward processing does not only comprise consummatory actions; a key component is represented by the anticipatory phase directed at procuring the reward. This phase is highly influenced by environmental food-associated stimuli, which can robustly enhance the desire to eat even in the absence of physiological needs. The opioid system (endogenous peptides and their receptors) has been strongly linked to the rewarding aspects of palatable food intake, and perhaps represents the key system involved in hedonic overeating. Here we review evidence suggesting that the opioid system can also be regarded as one of the systems that regulates the anticipatory incentive processes preceding binge eating hedonic episodes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6123cf058f610006f31","authors":["Giuliano, Chiara","Cottone, Pietro"],"doi":"10.1017\/s1092852915000668","first_seen_on":"2015-10-27T10:10:56+00:00","funders":["niehs","mrc"],"issns":["1092-8529","2165-6509"],"issue":"06","journal":"CNS spectrums","last_mentioned_on":1448326514,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26499083?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26499083","http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/action\/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=10017107&fileId=S1092852915000668","http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/action\/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=10037684&utm_source=Issue_Alert&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=CNS"],"pmid":"26499083","pubdate":"2015-10-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychiatry","neurology"],"title":"The role of the opioid system in binge eating disorder","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-opioid-system-binge-eating-disorder"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6602221,"mean":6.1274999121509,"rank":2940309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3484647,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6602221,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":210668,"mean":10.278685384992,"rank":103479,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":98297,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":210668,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":432,"mean":2.6357865429234,"rank":167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":256,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":432,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":2.3733333333333,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
