Two strategies to increase FV intake were tested.\nOne Head Start preschool participated. Two variations of family-style feeding were compared to usual practice: (1) Fruits, vegetables, and milk were served before the main meal (first course); and (2) fruits, vegetables, and milk were served before the main meal and meats and grains were removed from the table after the first serving (combination). A within-subject crossover design was used to test each condition for three meals. The amount of food served and consumed was weighed and converted to Child and Adult Care Feeding Program (CACFP) standard serving sizes for analysis.\nEighty-five children ages 3-5 participated. The sample was 81% Hispanic with diverse racial backgrounds. Thirty percent of the children were overweight. FV consumption was at CACFP recommended levels at baseline and remained consistent across conditions. The average amount served for each meal component was at or above CACFP recommendations for all foods except milk, which was consistently served in small portions. Meat and grains servings were frequently 2-3 times larger than CACFP recommendations. Milk consumption was significantly higher in the Combined intervention for two meals. Children ate significantly less meat during the Combined intervention for one meal.\nThe intervention led to significant increases in milk consumption, which was the only underconsumed meal component. These strategies should be tested with children who have lower baseline intake of FVs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e72","authors":["SchwartzMarlene B."],"doi":"10.1089\/chi.2015.0038","first_seen_on":"2015-10-25T19:46:20+00:00","issns":["2153-2176"],"journal":"Childhood Obesity","last_mentioned_on":1446486939,"links":["http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1089\/chi.2015.0038"],"pmid":"26280874","subjects":["metabolism","pediatrics"],"title":"Testing Variations on Family-Style Feeding To Increase Whole Fruit and Vegetable Consumption among Preschoolers in Child Care","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/testing-variations-familystyle-feeding-increase-whole-fruit-vegetable-consumption-among-preschoolers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.05,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6520864,"mean":6.0390053006769,"rank":1277102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":5237418,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6520864,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208695,"mean":10.228495711424,"rank":55522,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":152857,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208695,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245,"mean":13.31087704918,"rank":95,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":150,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":18.161846153846,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
