Specifically, this model predicts that when identities are highly important, having many versus few identities leads to greater psychological well-being if the identities are in harmony with each other-providing resources and expecting similar behaviors-but leads to lower psychological well-being if the identities conflict with each other-depleting resources and expecting incompatible behaviors. However, when identities are less important, neither the number of identities nor identity harmony should affect well-being. The authors further propose that emotions corresponding to self-perceptions of actual\/ought self-discrepancies mediate these effects. Results supported this model. The authors discuss implications of this model for well-being in the context of the increasing social complexity of modern life.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6023cf058f610006396","authors":["Brook, Amara T","Garcia, Julie","Fleming, Monique"],"doi":"10.1177\/0146167208324629","first_seen_on":"2015-10-25T11:21:55+00:00","issns":["0146-1672"],"issue":"12","journal":"Personality & Social Psychology Bulletin","last_mentioned_on":1445772097,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19050334"],"pmid":"19050334","pubdate":"2008-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"The effects of multiple identities on psychological well-being.","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-multiple-identities-psychological-wellbeing-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6447265,"mean":5.9812925678238,"rank":3042993,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1930458,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6447265,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":206958,"mean":10.057119459598,"rank":108950,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":76517,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":206958,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1430,"mean":21.81944436669,"rank":1226,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":71,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1430,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":52.0796,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":3}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Ph.
