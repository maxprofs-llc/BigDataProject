Being an adaptable technology, cloud computing is an excellent alternative for organizations for forming their own private cloud. Since the resources are limited in these private clouds maximizing the utilization of resources and giving the guaranteed service for the user are the ultimate goal. For that, efficient scheduling is needed. This research reports on an efficient data structure for resource management and resource scheduling technique in a private cloud environment and discusses a cloud model. The proposed scheduling algorithm considers the types of jobs and the resource availability in its scheduling decision. Finally, we conducted simulations using CloudSim and compared our algorithm with other existing methods, like V-MCT and priority scheduling algorithms.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f6100088c9","authors":["Shyamala Loganathan","Saswati Mukherjee"],"doi":"10.1155\/2015\/983018","first_seen_on":"2015-10-25T15:30:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1537-744X"],"journal":"The Scientific World Journal","last_mentioned_on":1445787391,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4587428\/"],"pmid":"26473166","pubdate":"2015-10-25T20:15:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Job Scheduling with Efficient Resource Monitoring in Cloud Datacenter","type":"article","volume":"2015","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/job-scheduling-efficient-resource-monitoring-cloud-datacenter"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6447265,"mean":5.9812925678238,"rank":2643889,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3658648,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6447265,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":206958,"mean":10.057085877743,"rank":89885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":110111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":206958,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1459,"mean":2.3449245541838,"rank":433,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":994,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1459,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":3.0555555555556,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Computer Science":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NewsBigData\/statuses\/658304514890604548","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4672121],"posted_on":"2015-10-25T15:30:01+00:00","author":{"name":"TBiBigData","url":"http:\/\/bigdata.tbiscientific.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/605680341760790528\/DMtuVJJC_normal.png","description":"#BigData4LifeSciences #Cloud #Tech news & resources for scientists and industrials.
