This study evaluated the effect of MeFirst, an individually tailored, online educational intervention, on HPV vaccine-related knowledge, vaccination intention, and uptake among previously unvaccinated female university students.\nAll female students aged 18-26 years who reported being unvaccinated against HPV at a midwestern university were invited via email to enroll. Participants completed an online survey that assessed baseline HPV vaccine-related knowledge, attitudes and vaccination intention. Participants (n\u2009=\u2009661) were then randomized to receive either an educational website automatically tailored to their baseline survey responses (MeFirst intervention) or a standard CDC information factsheet on HPV vaccine (control). Vaccine uptake and repeat knowledge and attitude measures were assessed with online surveys 3 months following the intervention and analyzed using logistic regression models.\nHPV vaccine uptake was similar in both the MeFirst and control groups at 3 months following the intervention (p\u2009=\u20090.98). Three months after the intervention, the proportion of participants with high knowledge regarding HPV vaccination increased from baseline (32% to 50%; p\u2009<\u20090.0001) but the proportion with favorable intention was unchanged.\nWe found that an individually tailored, online educational tool had similar effects as a nontailored factsheet on HPV-related knowledge, intention to HPV undergo vaccination, and HPV vaccine uptake among previously unvaccinated female university students.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fa2","authors":["BennettAlaina T."],"doi":"10.1089\/jwh.2015.5251","first_seen_on":"2015-10-27T08:05:47+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1931-843X"],"journal":"Journal of Women's Health (15409996)","last_mentioned_on":1447260571,"links":["http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1089\/jwh.2015.5251"],"pmid":"26488269","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gynecology"],"title":"Human Papillomavirus Vaccine Uptake After a Tailored, Online Educational Intervention for Female University Students: A Randomized Controlled Trial","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/human-papillomavirus-vaccine-uptake-after-tailored-online-educational-intervention-female-university-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6559289,"mean":6.0768461753774,"rank":2710430,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3699715,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6559289,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":210104,"mean":10.271827722593,"rank":94217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":109055,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":210104,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":767,"mean":10.497845953003,"rank":400,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":355,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":767,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":10.044117647059,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
