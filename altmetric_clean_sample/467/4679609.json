Although the ligand is capable of binding in several different conformations (acting as a ditopic donor through the pyridyl nitrogens), the experimental results (including X-ray structures) showed that it adopts a particular conformation when it binds with 90\u00b0 cis-blocked Pd(ii) acceptors (two available sites) to yield [2 + 2] self-assembled macrocycles. On the other hand, with Pd(NO3)2 (where four available sites are present) a different conformer of the same donor was selectively bound to form a molecular cubic cage. The experimental findings were corroborated well with the density functional theory (B3LYP) calculations. The tetratopic Pd(NO3)2 yielded a [6 + 12] self-assembled Pd6L12 molecular cube, which contains a potential void occupied by nitrate and perchlorate ions. Being a triazole based ligand, the free space inside the cage is enriched with several sp(2) hybridised nitrogen atoms with lone pairs of electrons to act as Lewis basic sites. Knoevenagel condensation reactions of several aromatic aldehydes with active methylene compounds were successfully performed in reasonably high yields in the presence of the cage.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Partha Sarathi Mukherjee","Prodip Howlader","Sandip Mukherjee","Rajat Saha"],"doi":"10.1039\/c5dt03185k","endpage":"20501","first_seen_on":"2015-10-27T14:04:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1477-9234"],"issue":"47","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1446894186,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2015\/DT\/C5DT03185K?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=inorganicnews","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26544720?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2015\/dt\/c5dt03185k","pmid":"26544720","pubdate":"2015-10-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"20493","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Conformation-selective coordination-driven self-assembly of a ditopic donor with Pd(II) acceptors.","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/conformationselective-coordinationdriven-selfassembly-ditopic-donor-pd-ii-acceptors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6535344,"mean":6.0554444909764,"rank":4833451,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":960042,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6535344,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":209850,"mean":10.268993247526,"rank":144224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":42398,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":209850,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9948,"mean":0.65055373479441,"rank":2290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":7196,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9948,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":702,"mean":0.6027817403709,"rank":203,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":465,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":702,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
