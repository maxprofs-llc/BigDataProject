This atypical laterality pattern is observed significantly more often in schizophrenia patients than in the general population, which led several authors to conclude that there is a genetic link between laterality and schizophrenia. It has even been suggested that a failure in the lateralization process, orchestrated by genes, could be the primary cause of schizophrenia. However, the molecular genetic evidence for a link between laterality and schizophrenia is weak. Recent genetic evidence indicates that schizophrenia is not a single disorder but a group of heritable disorders caused by different genotypic networks leading to distinct clinical symptoms. To uncover the link between schizophrenia and laterality we therefore suggest a paradigm shift where genetics are not mapped on schizophrenia as a whole but on discrete schizophrenia symptoms. In addition, we provide a critical evaluation of current theories on the genetic link between schizophrenia and brain asymmetry.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031ab","authors":["Ocklenburg, Sebastian","G\u00fcnt\u00fcrk\u00fcn, Onur","Hugdahl, Kenneth","Hirnstein, Marco"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neubiorev.2015.08.019","endpage":"110","first_seen_on":"2015-10-27T05:00:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["01497634","1873-7528"],"journal":"Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1496410260,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0149763415300178","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26598216?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26598216\/"],"pmid":"26598216","pubdate":"2015-11-25T16:25:27+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"100","subjects":["behavioralsciences","neurology"],"title":"Laterality and mental disorders in the postgenomic age - A closer look at schizophrenia and language lateralization.","type":"article","volume":"59","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/laterality-mental-disorders-postgenomic-age-closer-look-schizophrenia-language-lateralization"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.08,"score_history":{"1y":7.58,"6m":5.08,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8307635,"mean":7.0030489970953,"rank":1083581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":7218704,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8307635,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246487,"mean":9.7880288779077,"rank":41923,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":204466,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246487,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1704,"mean":10.485047563124,"rank":476,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":1225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1704,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":20.86005,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
