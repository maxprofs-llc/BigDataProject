We show here that human PCNA and MutL\u03b1 interact specifically but weakly in solution to form a complex of approximately 1:1 stoichiometry that depends on PCNA interaction with the C-terminal endonuclease domain of the MutL\u03b1 PMS2 subunit. Amino acid substitution mutations within a PMS2 C-terminal (721)QRLIAP motif attenuate or abolish human MutL\u03b1 interaction with PCNA, as well as PCNA-dependent activation of MutL\u03b1 endonuclease, PCNA- and DNA-dependent activation of MutL\u03b1 ATPase, and MutL\u03b1 function in in vitro mismatch repair. Amino acid substitution mutations within the corresponding yeast PMS1 motif ((723)QKLIIP) reduce or abolish mismatch repair in vivo. Coupling of a weak allele within this motif ((723)AKLIIP) with an exo1\u0394 null mutation, which individually confer only weak mutator phenotypes, inactivates mismatch repair in the yeast cell.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Jochen Genschel","Lyudmila Y.
