Previous studies reported the prevention of postsurgical decrease in BMD with the use of osteoporosis drug therapy. This randomized study evaluated the efficacy of alendronate and alfacalcidol for preserving BMD over a long-term follow-up.\nSixty consecutive patients with hip osteoarthritis who had undergone primary cementless total hip arthroplasty were randomly assigned to an alendronate (n\u00a0= 20), alfacalcidol (n\u00a0= 18), or control (n\u00a0= 22) group. Periprosthetic BMD was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at 1 week, 1 year, and the current follow-up (minimum 9 years after surgery). Changes in BMD are reported as mean percentages relative to the values at 1 week (baseline reference).\nAll groups showed a significant decrease in the BMD of the calcar at the current follow-up compared to the values at both 1 week and 1 year postoperatively (P < .001). The BMD values were significantly higher in the alendronate group than in the alfacalcidol and control groups (P < .05). The BMD values at the current follow-up were 76% \u00b1 30% (alendronate group), 64% \u00b1 22% (alfacalcidol group), and 59% \u00b1 22% (control group) of the baseline values.\nOur findings demonstrate the efficacy of early administration of alendronate for the prevention of bone loss in the calcar region.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6203cf058f610007b79","authors":["Yohei Yukizawa","Yutaka Inaba","Naomi Kobayashi","Hyonmin Choe","So Kubota","Tomoyuki Saito"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.arth.2017.02.036","first_seen_on":"2017-04-25T16:25:25+00:00","issns":["08835403"],"journal":"The Journal of Arthroplasty","last_mentioned_on":1493819805,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28318867?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28318867","pubdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Efficacy of alendronate for the prevention of bone loss in calcar region following total hip arthroplasty","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/efficacy-alendronate-prevention-bone-loss-calcar-region-following-total-hip-arthroplasty"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8150286,"mean":6.9044882123689,"rank":7054314,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8150286,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235386,"mean":12.696167742209,"rank":191704,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235386,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1423,"mean":4.9570464135021,"rank":1283,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1423,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":4.5132075471698,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/tripdatabase\/statuses\/856899778717810688","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19563989],"posted_on":"2017-04-25T15:56:42+00:00","author":{"name":"Trip Database","url":"http:\/\/www.tripdatabase.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2993778224\/e2ad2bb1255d395571656ead2239a48b_normal.png","description":"Evidence at your fingertips! \nIf you have a clinical Q, Trip can help!
