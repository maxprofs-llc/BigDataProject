Tissue engineering in combination with gene therapy is considered as a promising approach in new bone regeneration. Endothelin-1\uff08EDN-1\uff09is produced by vascular endothelial cells which plays an important role during bone development. However, its role in BMSCs remains largely unknown. We established EDN-1 overexpressed BMSCs, proliferation ability and osteogenesis differentiation were detected respectively. Transduced BMSCs were then combined with CPC-scaffold to repair calvarial defects in rats to evaluate the in-vivo osteogenic potential of EDN-1. EDN-1 overexpressed BMSCs showed increased proliferation and significantly increased osteogenesis potential ability than vector transfected control. The in-vivo data also revealed more new bone formation with higher bone mineral density and number of trabeculae in EDN-1 overexpressed BMSCs. These findings have demonstrated the influence of EDN-1 on differentiation potential of BMSCs, which suggest that EDN-1 may be a new promising agent for bone tissue engineering.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002890","authors":["Long-Wei Hu","Xiao Wang","Xin-Qun Jiang","Li-Qun Xu","Hong-Ya Pan"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.yexcr.2017.04.018","first_seen_on":"2017-04-25T19:35:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00144827"],"journal":"Experimental Cell Research","last_mentioned_on":1493694742,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0014482717302306"],"pmid":"28432001","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"In vivo and in vitro study of osteogenic potency of endothelin-1 on bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vivo-vitro-study-osteogenic-potency-endothelin1-bone-marrowderived-mesenchymal-stem-cells-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8161363,"mean":6.8964925866473,"rank":3854281,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4126173,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8161363,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235111,"mean":12.685564867509,"rank":109892,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":118109,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235111,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1429,"mean":2.3920546218487,"rank":730,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":676,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1429,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":1.1704545454545,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/celltherapynews\/statuses\/856954756761341952","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19568151],"posted_on":"2017-04-25T19:35:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Cell Therapy News","url":"http:\/\/www.celltherapynews.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/748289281672642560\/ULgWUrkm_normal.jpg","description":"The online resource for cell and gene therapy research.
