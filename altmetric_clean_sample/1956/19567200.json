Nevertheless, it may lead to serious complications.The authors present a 29-year-old patient admitted to their hospital 10 days after septoplasty in another institution. He suffered a total loss of vision immediately after the surgery.High-resolution computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a direct trauma of the optic canal and an inflamed and edematous optic nerve. Even though a successful endoscopic optic nerve was performed, the patient's loss of vision did not improve after the surgery.Blindness after septoplasty is an extremely rare but a devastating complication. There are only few patients that indicates the optic nerve injury caused by a direct trauma.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007c24","authors":["Kilavuz, Ahmet Erdem","Yildirim, Duzgun","Serin, Gediz Murat","Kaytaz, Asim"],"doi":"10.1097\/scs.0000000000003329","first_seen_on":"2017-04-25T18:45:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1049-2275","1536-3732"],"journal":"Journal of Craniofacial Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1493145918,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jcraniofacialsurgery\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Unilateral_Blindness_After_Septoplasty_.96534.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jcraniofacialsurgery\/9000\/00000\/Unilateral_Blindness_After_Septoplasty_.96534.pdf","pmid":"28437265","pubdate":"2017-04-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry","generalsurgery"],"title":"Unilateral Blindness After Septoplasty.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jcraniofacialsurgery\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Unilateral_Blindness_After_Septoplasty_.96534.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/unilateral-blindness-after-septoplasty"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8099079,"mean":6.8881653514065,"rank":4283842,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2248481,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8099079,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233506,"mean":12.659685882529,"rank":129932,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":82195,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233506,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3358,"mean":0.66261364313375,"rank":391,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":2772,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3358,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":0.72460317460317,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/mbhabal\/statuses\/856942210306199552","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19567200],"posted_on":"2017-04-25T18:45:18+00:00","author":{"name":"Mutaz Habal MD","url":"http:\/\/mhabal.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/800541043984859137\/mNuhxe6u_normal.jpg","description":"Surgeon","id_on_source":"mbhabal","tweeter_id":"318036240","geo":{"lt":27.94752,"ln":-82.45843,"country":"US"},"followers":181},"tweet_id":"856942210306199552"}]}}
