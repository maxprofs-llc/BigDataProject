Population studies indicate less than one in 10 children reaches their first birthday. In the face of mixed findings and recommendations for treatment, additional research is needed to further determine what contributes to longevity and implications for treatment for presenting medical conditions. The purpose of the present study is to report on presenting medical conditions and the presence or absence of the specific conditions (age at survey completion). Data on nine survivors (seven female, two male) with trisomy 13 indicated mean gestational age of approximately 36\u2009weeks, birth weight ranging from 1100 to 3290\u2009g and mean length of 45.3\u2009cm. Length of hospital stay after birth varied. The majority of infants presented with well-known physical characteristics. Medical conditions and their treatment varied at birth and at survey completion. Notably, several infants' cardiac anomalies resolved without surgical intervention. Surgeries were provided for a range of conditions including gastrostomy tube placement to address feeding issues and removal of intestinal blockage. There were no reports of holoprosencephaly. Implications and recommendations are provided.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f61000697d","authors":["Bruns, Deborah A.","Campbell, Emily"],"doi":"10.1002\/ajmg.a.36689","endpage":"2995","first_seen_on":"2014-10-16T20:10:23+00:00","issns":["1552-4833","1552-4825"],"issue":"12","journal":"American Journal of Medical Genetics.
