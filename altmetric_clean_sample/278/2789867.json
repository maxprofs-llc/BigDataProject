Blood and urine samples were collected at 17 designated time points and 7 designated intervals up to 36\u2009h post-dose. Plasma and urine concentrations of peramivir were quantified by LC-MS\/MS. 3.\u2002After single i.v. doses of 300 and 600\u2009mg peramivir, Cmax and AUC0-t of peramivir were 21.4\u2009\u00b1\u20093.7, 41.1\u2009\u00b1\u20095.3\u2009mg\u010bL(-1) and 55.90\u2009\u00b1\u200910.62, 112.1\u2009\u00b1\u200913.2\u2009mg\u010bh\u2009L(-1), respectively. Cmax and AUC increased in proportion to the dose.
