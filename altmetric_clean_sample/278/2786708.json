An 83-year-old woman was admitted to our emergency department for severe dyspnea due to exacerbation of aortic stenosis. Her Sp(O2) was 92-93% even after administration of 10 l x min(-1) oxygen through a reservoir-attached face mask. As she could not remain in the supine position, emergency tracheal intubation in the sitting position was required. After topical anesthesia with 8% lidocaine and careful administration of midazolam, the AWS was inserted into her mouth in the sitting, face-to-face position. The AWS allowed for visualization of the glottis and safe placement of the tracheal tube. Sufficient spontaneous ventilation was maintained during interventions with minimum vital sign changes. Awake intubation in the sitting position with the AWS may be helpful in resolving cardiovascular crisis in patients unable to maintain the supine position.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9273cf058f61000dd0b","authors":["Seno H","Komasawa N","Tatsumi S","Ohchi F","Miyazaki Y","Minami T"],"first_seen_on":"2014-10-17T18:34:58+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"8","journal":"Masui The Japanese journal of anesthesiology","last_mentioned_on":1413910991,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25199329?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25199329","pubdate":"2014-09-11T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["anesthesiology"],"title":"[Pentax-AWS Airwayscope for awake tracheal intubation in the face-to-face sitting position in an emergency patient with acute exacerbation of aortic stenosis].","type":"article","volume":"63","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pentaxaws-airwayscope-awake-tracheal-intubation-facetoface-sitting-position-emergency-patient-acute"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":2086770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":2382489,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122116,"mean":8.1984041272573,"rank":52469,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":68559,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122116,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":723,"mean":0.57437673130194,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":670,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":723,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":0.43055555555556,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
