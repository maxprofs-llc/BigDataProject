The response of its binding groove is investigated with the help of ultrafast pump-probe IR spectroscopy from picoseconds to tens of microseconds. The temperature dependence of that response is compatible with diffusive dynamics on a rugged energy landscape without any prominent energy barrier. Furthermore, the dependence of the kinetics on the concentration of certain viscogens, sucrose, and glycerol, has been investigated. A pronounced viscosity dependence is observed that can be best fit by a power law, i.e., a fractional viscosity dependence. The change of kinetics when comparing sucrose with glycerol as viscogen, however, provides strong evidence that direct interactions of the viscogen molecule with the protein do play a role as well. This conclusion is supported by accompanying molecular dynamics simulations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cee","authors":["Steven A. Waldauer","Steven A.
