The new species was previously confused with C. dehaani (H. Milne Edwards, 1853). The different carapace shape, proportionally longer ambulatory legs, large adult size and the distinct live coloration distinguish the new species from its two closest congeners, C. dehaani and C. neglectus (De Man, 1887). Available information indicates that C. magnus n. sp. is endemic to the Ogasawara Is.; there is no evidence of the occurrence of the true C. dehaani in the Ogasawara Is.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008daf","authors":["Tomoyuki Komai","Peter K L Ng"],"first_seen_on":"2014-10-17T18:52:15+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1175-5326"],"journal":"ZOOTAXA","last_mentioned_on":1413571484,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25232626?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25232626","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"A new species of sesarmid crab of the genus Chiromantes (Crustacea: Decapoda: Brachyura) from the Ogasawara Islands, Japan.","type":"article","volume":"3681"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":3054560,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":933470,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122117,"mean":8.1970308559077,"rank":79187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":30721,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122117,"percentile":25},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3886,"mean":2.1070239382239,"rank":3420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3886,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":14.686454545455,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":8}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/colsci_papers\/status\/523182842767880192","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2786822],"posted_on":"2014-10-17T18:44:44+00:00","author":{"name":"ColSci","url":"http:\/\/colsci.weebly.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/438201522103390208\/hL3zNUTL_normal.jpeg","description":"Papers on colouration and vision in nature (#colsci), mostly fed from #pubmed.
