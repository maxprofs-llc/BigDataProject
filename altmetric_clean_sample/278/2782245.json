A percentage of ERalpha cells located in the ARC and VMN express somatostatin (SST) and are activated in response to estradiol. The aims of the present study were to a) investigate the location of c-Fos, a marker for activation, in cells containing ERalpha or SST at various times during the follicular phase, and b) determine if lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration, which leads to disruption of the LH surge, is accompanied by altered ERalpha and\/or SST activation patterns. Follicular phases were synchronized with progesterone vaginal pessaries and control animals were killed at 0, 16, 31 or 40 h (n = 4-6\/group) after progesterone withdrawal (PW; time zero). At 28 h, other animals received LPS (100 ng\/kg) and were subsequently killed at 31 h or 40 h (n = 5\/group). Hypothalamic sections were immunostained for c-Fos and ERalpha or SST. LH surges occurred only in control ewes with onset at 36.7 \u00b1 1.3 h after PW: these animals had a marked increase in the percentage of ERalpha cells that co-localized c-Fos (%ERalpha\/c-Fos) in the ARC and mPOA from 31 h after PW and throughout the LH surge. In the VMN, %ERalpha\/c-Fos was higher in animals that expressed sexual behavior compared to those that did not. SST cell activation in the ARC and VMN was greater during the LH surge compared to other stages in the follicular phase. At 31 or 40 h after PW (i.e., 3 or 12 h after treatment, respectively), LPS decreased %ERalpha\/c-Fos in the ARC and the mPOA but there was no change in the VMN compared to controls. The %SST\/c-Fos increased in the VMN at 31 h after PW (i.e., 3 h after LPS) with no change in the ARC compared to controls. These results indicate that there is a distinct temporal pattern of ERalpha cell activation in the hypothalamus during the follicular phase, which begins in the ARC and mPOA at least 6-7 h before the LH surge onset, and extends to the VMN after the onset of sexual behavior and the LH surge. Furthermore, during the surge, some of these ERalpha activated cells may be SST secreting cells. This pattern is markedly altered by acute LPS administered during the late follicular phase indicating that the disruptive effects of this stressor are mediated by suppressing ERalpha cell activation at the level of the mPOA and ARC, and enhancing SST-cell activation in the VMN, leading to the attenuation of the LH surge.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c6e","authors":["Chrysanthi Fergani","Jean E Routly","David Jones","Lucy C Pickavance","Robert F Smith","Hilary Dobson","Fergani C","Routly JE","Jones D","Pickavance LC","Smith RF","Dobson H","Jean E.
