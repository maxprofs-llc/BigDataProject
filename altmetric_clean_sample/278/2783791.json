Almost all multiple myeloma patients develop osteolytic bone lesions associated with severe and debilitating bone pain, pathologic fractures, hypercalcemia, and spinal cord compression, as well as increased mortality. Biomarkers of bone remodelling are used to identify disease characteristics that can help select the optimal management of patients. However, more accurate biomarkers are needed to effectively mirror the dynamics of bone disease activity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b9","authors":["Paul Dowling","Catriona Hayes","Kay Reen Ting","Abdul Hameed","Justine Meiller","Constantine Mitsiades","Kenneth C Anderson","Martin Clynes","Colin Clarke","Paul Richardson","Peter O\u2019Gorman"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2164-15-904","first_seen_on":"2014-10-17T00:53:17+00:00","issns":["1471-2164",""],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1459291216,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/15\/904\/abstract","http:\/\/bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2164-15-904"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2164-15-904.pdf","pmid":"25322877","pubdate":"2014-10-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"904","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Identification of proteins found to be significantly altered when comparing the serum proteome from Multiple Myeloma patients with varying degrees of bone disease","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-proteins-found-significantly-altered-comparing-serum-proteome-multiple-myeloma-patien"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7458268,"mean":6.4789686129458,"rank":2901388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4502479,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7458268,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195771,"mean":7.6175522603057,"rank":60359,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":133719,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195771,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5455,"mean":4.0622225889256,"rank":2163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":3173,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5455,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":293,"mean":4.1472465753425,"rank":92,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":196,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":293,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
