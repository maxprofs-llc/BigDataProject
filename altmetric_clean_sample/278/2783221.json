The transcription rate for IL-6 in muscle nuclei isolated from muscle biopsies during exercise is very high and is enhanced further when muscle glycogen content is low. Furthermore, cultured human primary muscle cells can increase IL-6 mRNA when incubated with the calcium ionophore ionomycin and it is likely that myocytes produce IL-6 in response to muscle contraction. The biological roles of muscle-derived IL-6 have been investigated in studies in which human recombinant IL-6 was infused in healthy volunteers to mimic closely the IL-6 concentrations observed during prolonged exercise. Using stable isotopes, we have demonstrated that physiological concentrations of IL-6 induce lipolysis. Although we have yet to determine the precise biological action of muscle-derived IL-6, our data support the hypothesis that the role of IL-6 released from contracting muscle during exercise is to act in a hormone-like manner to mobilize extracellular substrates and\/or augment substrate delivery during exercise. In addition, IL-6 inhibits low-level TNF-alpha production, and IL-6 produced during exercise probably inhibits TNF-alpha-induced insulin resistance in peripheral tissues. Hence, IL-6 produced by skeletal muscle during contraction may play an important role in the beneficial health effects of exercise","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032d7","authors":["Bente Klarlund Pedersen","Adam Steensberg","Pernille Keller","Charlotte Keller","Christian Fischer","Natalie Hiscock","Gerrit van Hall","Peter Plomgaard","Mark A Febbraio","Pedersen, Bente Klarlund","Steensberg, Adam","Keller, Pernille","Keller, Charlotte","Fischer, Christian","Hiscock, Natalie","van Hall, Gerrit","Plomgaard, Peter","Febbraio, Mark A"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00424-002-0981-z","endpage":"16","first_seen_on":"2014-10-16T21:30:46+00:00","issns":["0031-6768","1432-2013"],"issue":"1","journal":"Pflugers Archiv European Journal of Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1413495012,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12690457"],"pmid":"12690457","pubdate":"2003-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"LifeSciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"9","subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Muscle-derived interleukin-6: lipolytic, anti-inflammatory and immune regulatory effects.","type":"article","volume":"446","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/musclederived-interleukin6-lipolytic-antiinflammatory-immune-regulatory-effects"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4382167,"mean":4.8599410432877,"rank":3420100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":127395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4382167,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117607,"mean":7.6632829447478,"rank":89432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":693,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117607,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":490,"mean":2.6495419222904,"rank":394,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":490,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":1.224,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":10,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
