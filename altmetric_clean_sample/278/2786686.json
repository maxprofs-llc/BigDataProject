Given the important role of pigs in the zoonotic cycle of IAV we cloned swine IFITMs (swIFITM) and found two IFITM1-like proteins, one homologue of IFITM2 and one of IFITM3. We show that swIFITM2 and swIFITM3 localize to endosomes and display potent antiviral activity. Knockdown of swIFITMs strongly reduced virus inhibition by interferon establishing the swIFITMs as potent restriction factors in porcine cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f92","authors":["Caroline Lanz","Emilio Y\u00e1ng\u00fcez","Dario Andenmatten","Silke Stertz"],"doi":"10.1128\/jvi.02516-14","first_seen_on":"2014-10-17T18:32:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1098-5514"],"journal":"Journal of Virology","last_mentioned_on":1448692020,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25320322?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/jvi.asm.org\/content\/89\/1\/863.long"],"pmid":"25320322","pubdate":"2014-10-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Swine Interferon-Inducible Transmembrane Proteins Potently Inhibit Influenza A Virus Replication","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/swine-interferoninducible-transmembrane-proteins-potently-inhibit-influenza-virus-replication"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.016,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.016},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6615543,"mean":6.1355830745238,"rank":798099,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":5816978,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6615543,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168079,"mean":8.2206020657078,"rank":26908,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":141162,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168079,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5839,"mean":3.8890791366906,"rank":532,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":5305,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5839,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143,"mean":2.4650845070423,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":132,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
