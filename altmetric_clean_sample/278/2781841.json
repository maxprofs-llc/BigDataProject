Releases of industrial, ship, and agricultural effluents in the river increased substantially, fish yields decreased, and toxic damage to marine organisms increased. Among the divers (16,343 person-years follow-up from 18 years of age to year 2000), the observed\/expected ratio for all tumors was 2.29 (p<0.01). Risks increased in cohorts first diving after 1960 compared to risks in earlier cohorts, notably for hematolymphopoietic, central nervous system, gastrointestinal, and skin cancer; induction periods were often brief. The findings suggest that the increases in risk for cancer and short induction periods resulted from direct contact with and absorption of multiple toxic compounds. Early toxic effects in marine life predicted later risks for cancer in divers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027e9","authors":["Elihu D Richter","Lee S Friedman","Yuval Tamir","Tamar Berman","Or Levy","Jerome B Westin","Tamar Peretz"],"first_seen_on":"2014-10-16T14:55:33+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0091-6765"],"issue":"4","journal":"Environmental Health Perspectives","last_mentioned_on":1413515711,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1241453\/pdf\/ehp0111-000609.pdf"],"pdf_url":"\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1241453\/pdf\/ehp0111-000609.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1241453","pmid":"12676624","pubdate":"2003-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Institute of Environmental Health Science","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"609","subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Cancer risks in naval divers with multiple exposures to carcinogens.","type":"article","volume":"111","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cancer-risks-naval-divers-multiple-exposures-carcinogens"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4384254,"mean":4.8545329767884,"rank":3099440,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":1202036,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4384254,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117664,"mean":7.6499722767566,"rank":78038,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":36527,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117664,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2637,"mean":7.6857086494689,"rank":2109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":505,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2637,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":17.670454545455,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
