Reaction of FcPPB with tris(norbornene)platinum(0) provided [Pt(FcPPB)] (1) in which the arylborane is \u03b7(3) BCC-coordinated. Subsequent reaction with CO and CNXyl (Xyl=2,6-dimethylphenyl) afforded [PtL(FcPPB)] {L=CO (2) and CNXyl (3)} featuring \u03b7(2) BC- and \u03b7(1) B-arylborane coordination modes, respectively. Reaction of 1 or 2 with H2 yielded [PtH(\u03bc-H)(FcPPB)] in which the borane is bound to a hydride ligand on platinum. Addition of PhC2 H to [Pt(FcPPB)] afforded [Pt(C2 Ph)(\u03bc-H)(FcPPB)] (5), which rapidly converted to [Pt(FcPPB')] (6; FcPPB'=[Fe(\u03b7(5) -C5 H4 PPh2 )(\u03b7(5) -C5 H4 PtBu{C6 H4 (BPh-CPh=CHPh-Z)-ortho}]) in which the newly formed vinylborane is \u03b7(3) BCC-coordinated. Unlike arylborane complex 1, vinylborane complex 6 does not react with CO, CNXyl, H2 or HC2 Ph at room temperature.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Cowie, Bradley E.","Emslie, David J.
