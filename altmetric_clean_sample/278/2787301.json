Rates were found to be 3 orders of magnitude faster in hexanes than THF, and reductions of alkyl halides were inverse first order in THF. These findings show the solvent milieu significantly impacts the rate of substrate reduction, a consideration that may prove useful in synthesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e9f","authors":["Tesia V.
