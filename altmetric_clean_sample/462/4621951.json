Thus, the ability to use attention to filter out irrelevant information is an important factor in how efficiently the limited storage space is used. Here, we examined to what degree the requirement to flexibly change filter settings affects filtering efficiency. Participants were presented with visual objects in different colors, and a cue presented in advance indicated which objects had to be stored. The contralateral delay activity, an event-related brain potential that reflects working-memory load was used to assess filtering efficiency during the retention interval. The data of two experiments showed that when filter settings had to be adjusted on a trial-by-trial basis, more irrelevant information passed the gate to working memory. Moreover, this switching-induced filtering deficit was restricted to those items that matched the previous, but currently irrelevant, filter settings. Thus, lingering effects of the selection history seem to counteract goal-directed encoding, and thus constitute an important attentional limitation for the efficient utilization of our limited workspace.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f610003784","authors":["Jost, Kerstin","Mayr, Ulrich","Kerstin Jost","Ulrich Mayr"],"doi":"10.3758\/s13415-015-0380-5","endpage":"218","first_seen_on":"2015-10-14T10:00:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1531-135X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Cognitive, Affective & Behavioral Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1473054766,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26450507","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3758\/s13415-015-0380-5"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.3758%2Fs13415-015-0380-5.pdf","pmid":"26450507","pubdate":"2015-10-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"207","subjects":["behavioralsciences","neurology"],"title":"Switching between filter settings reduces the efficient utilization of visual working memory.","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/switching-between-filter-settings-reduces-efficient-utilization-visual-working-memory"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8331095,"mean":7.02255168024,"rank":4196766,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3920647,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8331095,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244314,"mean":9.6033228276841,"rank":116046,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":118246,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244314,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":556,"mean":4.5570378378378,"rank":272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":254,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":556,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":3.0942222222222,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
