A concern with the increasing number of female athletes is the potential for eating disorders to go undiagnosed. As defined by the American Psychological Association, \"eating disorders are characterized by a persistent disturbance of eating or eating related behavior that results in the altered consumption or absorption of food that significantly impairs physical health or psychosocial functioning.\" Eating disorders include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating, and non-specific disordered eating, which is defined as a wide spectrum of maladaptive eating and weight control behaviors and attitudes. Eating disorders often go undiagnosed due to the lack of screening and the individual's unwillingness to recognize the disorder for fear of shame and embarrassment. However, an unrecognized eating disorder could lead to poor health or development of the female athlete triad. To date, most pre-participation examinations (PPEs) do not include screening tools to detect eating disorders. Since there is currently no gold standard, examining the diagnostic accuracy of available screening tools for eating disorders in female athletes will help clinicians identify the best tool to implement.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f37","authors":["Sleight, Alyssa J","Erickson, Casey D","Tierney, Dayna K","Houston, Megan N","Welch, Cailee
