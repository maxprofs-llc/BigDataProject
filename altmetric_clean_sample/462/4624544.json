The performance of the outreach service was measured by counting the number of sex workers who started hepatitis B vaccination in the programme. The hepatitis B vaccination schemes were assessed by analysing the number of people completing the vaccination.\nNaturally acquired HBV was found in 11.9% of 1096 sex workers (0.6% HBsAg), and 7% were vaccinated in existing services. In contrast, hepatitis B vaccination using outreach methodology was able to achieve higher vaccination rates: among non-immune sex workers 82.8% received the first dose of vaccine, and 71.5% the second. If given 1 month later, 67.9% received the third dose, in contrast with 47.9%, when given 6 months later.\nExisting services are not successful in vaccinating sex workers for HBV, in contrast with specifically targeted outreach services. Shorter intervals between vaccine doses gave better compliance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f610003525","authors":["R Mak","A Traen","M Claeyssens","L Van Renterghem","G Leroux-Roels","P Van Damme"],"doi":"10.1136\/sti.79.2.157","first_seen_on":"2015-10-14T21:27:39+00:00","issns":["1368-4973","1472-3263"],"issue":"2","journal":"Sexually Transmitted Infections","last_mentioned_on":1136073600,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/sti.79.2.157"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/sti.bmj.com\/content\/79\/2\/157.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1744641","pmid":"12690142","pubdate":"2003-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["sexuallytransmitteddiseases"],"title":"Hepatitis B vaccination for sex workers: do outreach programmes perform better?","type":"article","volume":"79","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hepatitis-b-vaccination-sex-workers-outreach-programmes-perform-better"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8106765,"mean":6.8893720095886,"rank":2045070,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4954391,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8106765,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242871,"mean":9.5777704697986,"rank":71210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":167026,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242871,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1952,"mean":8.5275817529472,"rank":958,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":637,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1952,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":6.090512195122,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
