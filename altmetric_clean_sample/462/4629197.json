No contrast agent was used in order to increase the X-ray attenuation by water. We show that only by using the phase contrast mode it is possible to achieve enough water content change resolution to investigate the drying process at the pore-scale. We performed 3D image analysis of the time-differential phase contrast tomogram. We show by the results of such analysis that it is possible to obtain a reliable characterization of the spatial redistribution of water in the resolved pore system in agreement with what expected from the theory of drying in porous media and from measurements performed with other approaches. We thus show the potential of X-ray phase contrast imaging for pore-scale investigations of reactive water transport processes which cannot be imaged by adding a contrast agent for exploiting the standard attenuation contrast imaging mode.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e58","authors":["YANG, F.","GRIFFA, M.","BONNIN, A.","MOKSO, R.","DI BELLA, C.","M\u00dcNCH, B.","KAUFMANN, R.","LURA, P.","BELLA, C."],"doi":"10.1111\/jmi.12319","endpage":"104","first_seen_on":"2015-10-15T15:41:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1365-2818"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Microscopy","last_mentioned_on":1444923655,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/jmi.12319&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jmi.12319\/pdf","pmid":"26469285","pubdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Condensed Matter Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Materials Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"88","subjects":["diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Visualization of water drying in porous materials by X\u2010ray phase contrast imaging","type":"article","volume":"261","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/visualization-water-drying-porous-materials-xray-phase-contrast-imaging"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6430168,"mean":5.987749129688,"rank":4753817,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":950059,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6430168,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201993,"mean":10.074154986336,"rank":137259,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":42216,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201993,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":478,"mean":1.6388846960168,"rank":287,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":77,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":478,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":0.52941176470588,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
