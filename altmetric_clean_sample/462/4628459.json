The number of GRNX-resistant strains was significantly greater than those of LVFX, CPFX, and STFX (P\u2009<\u20090.05).\nSTFX showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa for recent pathogens recovered from CSOM as compared with the others, suggesting that the clinical application of topical STFX would be useful to prevent the emergence of resistant mutants of P. aeruginosa.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b3","authors":["Katsuhisa Ikeda","Shigeki Misawa","Takeshi Kusunoki"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12901-015-0018-9","first_seen_on":"2015-10-15T12:49:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1472-6815"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1465298583,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1186%2Fs12901-015-0018-9","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26472937?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/s12901-015-0018-9"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1186%2Fs12901-015-0018-9.pdf","pmid":"26472937","pubdate":"2015-10-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Head and Neck Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Otorhinolaryngology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Comparative bactericidal activity of four fluoroquinolones against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from chronic suppurative otitis media.","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparative-bactericidal-activity-four-fluoroquinolones-against-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-isolated-chro"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7866440,"mean":6.6628832942016,"rank":760830,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7074262,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7866440,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241739,"mean":9.4322416583242,"rank":33403,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":207533,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241739,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":3.6475333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
