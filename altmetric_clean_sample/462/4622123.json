The study was undertaken in primary schools in a Primary Care Trust (PCT) in the North East of England, UK. One-to-one semi-structured interviews were conducted post-NCMP measurement (and the feedback) with a sample of 21 children, aged 10-11 years, conveniently sampled from the primary schools in the PCT. Findings from the study indicate that the NCMP, especially the weight feedback letter caused annoyance, panic and worry among children who were indicated to have weight problems and oversensitised all children about weight issues, regardless of their weight category. The NCMP is a potentially useful 'wake-up call' to the fact that something needs to be done for children identified to be overweight or obese but needs to be delivered with a sensitivity to the impact of the news on the child.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a0a","authors":["Nnyanzi, Lawrence Achilles","Lawrence Achilles Nnyanzi"],"doi":"10.1177\/1367493515604493","endpage":"472","first_seen_on":"2015-10-14T11:11:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1741-2889","1367-4935"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Child Health Care","last_mentioned_on":1506648617,"links":["http:\/\/chc.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2015\/09\/24\/1367493515604493.long","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26447217","http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/1367493515604493","http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/stoken\/default+domain\/10.1177\/1367493515604493\/full?utm_source=SAGE_social&hootPostID=9bec309b3a4fbf643e76eb490a9f6220","http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/stoken\/default+domain\/10.1177\/1367493515604493\/full?utm_source=SAGE_social&hootPostID=9cb522f26e4f2af5dcf44fd68546a088","http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/stoken\/default+domain\/10.1177\/1367493515604493\/full?utm_source=SAGE_social&hootPostID=52b43cacfe901f3103afc86c8c113095"],"pmid":"26447217","pubdate":"2015-10-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"SAGE PublicationsSage UK: London, England","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"464","subjects":["nursing","pediatrics"],"title":"Combating childhood obesity: Reactions of children aged 10-11 years towards the National Child Measurement Programme.","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/combating-childhood-obesity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.8,"score_history":{"1y":5.3,"6m":0.75,"3m":0.75,"1m":0.75,"1w":0.75,"6d":0.75,"5d":0.75,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462498,"mean":7.1083922572655,"rank":1166890,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":7293181,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462498,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244916,"mean":9.6233349856072,"rank":42555,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":202249,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244916,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259,"mean":3.3858449612403,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":237,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":2.77,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":3,"practitioner":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":5,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
