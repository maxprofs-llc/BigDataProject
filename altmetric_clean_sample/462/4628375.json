The main goals of this centralized organization were to collect blood from healthy voluntary donors, to screen the donated blood and to provide various safe blood products based on scientific and ethical standards. In due course, a new era of blood transfusion service in Iran had begun to such a degree that after more than four decades of its activity, it is now considered the best-developed blood service in the eastern Mediterranean region. Here, a brief historical account of the early blood transfusion efforts and the establishment of the modern Iranian National Blood Transfusion Service in Iran is discussed in addition to the life and career of its founder and first director, Professor Fereydoun Ala.","authors":["Azizi, Mohammad Hossein","Nayernouri, Touraj","Bahadori, Moslem"],"doi":"015186\/aim.0016","first_seen_on":"2015-10-15T12:22:37+00:00","issns":["1735-3947"],"issue":"6","journal":"Archives of Iranian medicine","last_mentioned_on":1482068653,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26058940|title=The History of the Foundation of the Iranian National Blood Transfusion Service, Azizi MH, Nayer-nouri T, Bahadori M.
