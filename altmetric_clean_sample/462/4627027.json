This effect is due to L-DOPA's impairment of the ability to update beliefs in response to undesirable information about the future. To test whether an 'optimistic' bias is also mediated by dopamine in animals, first, two groups of rats received either a dopaminergic precursor, L-DOPA, or a D2 receptor antagonist, haloperidol, and were subsequently tested using the ambiguous-cue interpretation (ACI) paradigm. To test whether similar effects might be observed when manipulating another neurotransmitter implicated in learning about reward and punishment, we administered the serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor escitalopram to a third group of animals and the selective and irreversible tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor para-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) to a fourth group. The results of our study demonstrated that prolonged (2 weeks), but not acute, L-DOPA administration induced optimistic bias in rats. Neither acute nor chronic treatment with the other tested compounds had significant effects on the cognitive judgment bias of rats. The convergence of these results with human studies suggests the translational validity of the ambiguous-cue interpretation paradigm in testing the effects of pharmacological manipulations on cognitive judgment bias (optimism\/pessimism) in rats.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023ad","authors":["Kregiel, J","Golebiowska, J","Popik, P","Rygula, R"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbr.2015.10.020","first_seen_on":"2015-10-15T06:25:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["01664328","1872-7549"],"journal":"Behavioural Brain Research","last_mentioned_on":1506850087,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S016643281530231X"],"pmid":"26462571","pubdate":"2015-10-16T22:03:10+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["brain","behavioralsciences"],"title":"Dopamine induces an optimism bias in rats \u2013 pharmacological proof for the translational validity of the ambiguous-cue interpretation test.
