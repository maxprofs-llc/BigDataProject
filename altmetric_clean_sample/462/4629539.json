Poly ADP-ribosylation mediated by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is known to regulate transcription through histone modification. Recent studies have suggested that PARP-1 positively regulates the formation of long-term memory (LTM); however, the roles of PARP-1 in memory processes, especially processes after retrieval, remain unknown.\nHere, we show critical roles for PARP-1 in the consolidation, reconsolidation, and extinction of contextual fear memory in mice. We examined the effects of pharmacological inhibition of PARP-1 activity in the hippocampus or medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) on these memory processes. Similarly with previous findings, a micro-infusion of the PARP-1 inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide or PJ34 into the dorsal hippocampus, but not mPFC, impaired LTM formation without affecting short-term memory (STM). Importantly, this pharmacological blockade of PARP-1 in the dorsal hippocampus, but not mPFC, also disrupted post-reactivation LTM without affecting post-reactivation STM. Conversely, micro-infusion of the PARP-1 inhibitors into the mPFC, but not dorsal hippocampus, blocked long-term extinction. Additionally, systemic administration of the PARP-1 inhibitor Tiq-A blocked c-fos induction in the hippocampus, which is observed when memory is consolidated or reconsolidated, and also blocked c-fos induction in the mPFC, which is observed when memory is extinguished.\nOur observations showed that PARP-1 activation is required for the consolidation, reconsolidation, and extinction of contextual fear memory and suggested that PARP-1 contributes to the new gene expression necessary for these memory processes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000872","authors":["Hiroyoshi Inaba","Akinori Tsukagoshi","Satoshi Kida"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13041-015-0153-7","first_seen_on":"2015-10-15T16:25:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1756-6606"],"issue":"1","journal":"Molecular Brain","last_mentioned_on":1445863590,"links":["http:\/\/www.molecularbrain.com\/content\/8\/1\/63"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.molecularbrain.com\/content\/pdf\/s13041-015-0153-7.pdf","pmid":"26471780","pubdate":"2015-10-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychopharmacology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"63","subjects":["molecularbiology","brain"],"title":"PARP-1 activity is required for the reconsolidation and extinction of contextual fear memory","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/parp1-activity-required-reconsolidation-extinction-contextual-fear-memory"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7658425,"mean":6.5807127043321,"rank":3477692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4150086,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7658425,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240884,"mean":9.3995058679939,"rank":101748,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":137635,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240884,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":418,"mean":4.1932086330935,"rank":203,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":418,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":4.5769230769231,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
