The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare pain and morbidity in hybrid NOTES and standard laparoscopy.\nA systematic literature search was performed to identify RCTs and non-RCTs comparing hybrid NOTES and standard laparoscopy. The main outcome was pain on postoperative day (POD) 1. Secondary outcomes were pain during the further postsurgical course, rescue analgesia, complications, and satisfaction with the cosmetic result. The results of meta-analysis in a random-effects model were presented as odds ratio (ORs) or standard mean differences (MDs) with 95 per cent confidence intervals.\nSix RCTs and 21 non-randomized trials including 2186 patients were identified. In hybrid NOTES the score on the numerical pain scale was lower on POD\u20091 (-0\u00b775, 95 per cent c.i. -1\u00b709 to -0\u00b742; P\u2009=\u20090\u00b7001) and on POD\u20092-4 (-0\u00b758, -0\u00b791 to -0\u00b726; P\u2009<\u20090\u00b7001) than that for standard laparoscopy. The need for rescue analgesia was reduced in hybrid NOTES (OR 0\u00b736, 0\u00b724 to 0\u00b754; P\u2009<\u20090\u00b7001). The reduction in complications found for hybrid NOTES compared with standard laparoscopy (OR 0\u00b752, 0\u00b738 to 0\u00b771; P\u2009<\u20090\u00b7001) was not significant when only RCTs were considered (OR 0\u00b783, 0\u00b743 to 1\u00b760; P\u2009=\u20090\u00b7570). The score for cosmetic satisfaction was higher after NOTES (MD 1\u00b714, 0\u00b757 to 1\u00b771; P\u2009<\u20090\u00b7001).\nHybrid NOTES reduces postoperative pain and is associated with greater cosmetic satisfaction in selected patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002457","authors":["D.
