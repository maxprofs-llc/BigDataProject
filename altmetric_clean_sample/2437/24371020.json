This device rapidly establishes linear concentration gradients by exploiting solute diffusion through porous membranes in the absence of convective flows. As such, the gradients are created rapidly and can be sustained for long time periods (e.g., hours), sufficient to evaluate cell phenotype. The device exploits a unique simple bilayer configuration that enables rapid setup and quick reproducible introduction of cells. Its reusability represents an additional advantage in that it need not be limited to settings with microfluidics expertise. We have successfully demonstrated the applicability of this tool in studying the chemotactic response of Escherichia coli to glucose. When coupled with our recent Python program, quantified metrics such as speed, ratio of tumble to run, and effective diffusivity can be obtained from slow frame rate videos. Moreover, we introduce a chemotaxis partition coefficient that conveniently scores swimming behavior on the single-cell level.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51e3cf058f6100039c3","authors":["Wu Shang","Chen-Yu Tsao","Xiaolong Luo","Mairan Teodoro","Ryan McKay","David N.
