Phototherapy as Light-emitting diode (LED) has emerged as a treatment that presents good results for diseases that are characterized by inflammation. Thus, our objective was to investigate the effects of LED on lung inflammation, by an evaluation of lung cell infiltration, mucus secretion, oedema, and the production of cytokines. Male Balb\/c mice were or not sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA) and treated or not with LED therapy (1\u2005h and 4\u2005h after each OVA challenge). Twenty-four hours after the last OVA challenge, analyzes were performed. Our results showed that LED treatment in asthmatic mice reduced the lung cell infiltration, the mucus production, the oedema, and the tracheal's contractile response. It also increased the IL-10 and the IFN-gamma levels. The effects of LED treatment on lung inflammation may be modulated by IL-10, IFN-gamma, and by mast cells. This study may provide important information about the effects of LED, and in addition, it may open the possibility of a new approach for the treatment of asthma.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007ba3","authors":["Siqueira, Vanessa Perosino Cardoso","Evangelista, Marina Izadora Silveira","dos\u2005Santos, Alana","Marcos, Rodrigo Labat","Ligeiro\u2010de\u2010Oliveira, Ana Paula","Pavani, Christiane","Damazo, Am\u00edlcar Sabino","Lino\u2010dos\u2010Santos\u2010Franco, Adriana","Ligeiro-de-Oliveira, Ana Paula","Lino-dos-Santos-Franco, Adriana","Vanessa Perosino Cardoso Siqueira","Marina Izadora Silveira Evangelista","Alana dos Santos","Rodrigo Labat Marcos","Ana Paula Ligeiro-de-Oliveira","Christiane Pavani","Am\u00edlcar Sabino Damazo","Adriana Lino-dos-Santos-Franco"],"doi":"10.1002\/jbio.201600247","first_seen_on":"2017-04-18T07:07:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1864-0648","1864-063X","1864063X"],"journal":"Journal of Biophotonics","last_mentioned_on":1494496528,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jbio.201600247\/abstract;jsessionid=305C9CD7745AA77EFE254D0253A76B04.f01t01","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28417574?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28417574"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jbio.201600247\/pdf","pmid":"28417574","pubdate":"2017-04-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics"],"title":"Light\u2010Emitting Diode treatment ameliorates allergic lung inflammation in experimental model of asthma induced by ovalbumin","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8187659,"mean":6.9230329122133,"rank":4103140,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3875764,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8187659,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238142,"mean":12.834501979919,"rank":121631,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":106313,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238142,"percentile":44},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":845,"mean":2.9378886255924,"rank":308,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":452,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":845,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":0.84125,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jbiophotonics\/statuses\/854229865263792129","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18921688],"posted_on":"2017-04-18T07:07:25+00:00","author":{"name":"J Biophotonics","url":"http:\/\/www.biophotonics-journal.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/699599691110072320\/TcOEzHge_normal.jpg","description":"Imprint\/Impressum:  http:\/\/bit.ly\/tU7VOw.\r\nFast and interdisciplinary: cutting edge research on interactions between light and biological material.","id_on_source":"jbiophotonics","tweeter_id":"131830280","geo":{"lt":51.5,"ln":10.5,"country":"DE"},"followers":258},"tweet_id":"854229865263792129"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/asthma_papers\/statuses\/854648558791741440","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18921688],"posted_on":"2017-04-19T10:51:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Asthma Papers","url":"https:\/\/github.com\/roblanf\/phypapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/439482171208646656\/OWe4b0kE_normal.jpeg","description":"RSS feed for #asthma papers in #Pubmed.
