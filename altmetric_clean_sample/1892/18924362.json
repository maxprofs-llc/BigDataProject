Indeed, hormonal dysregulation is a common component of chronic pain syndromes. Studies have attempted to determine whether the relationship between the pain and its perception and hormones is a causative relationship and how these processes interrelate. This review summarizes and analyzes the current experimental data and provides an overview of the studies addressing these questions. The relationship between pain perception and endocrine effects suggests that hormones can be used as important biomarkers of chronic pain syndromes and\/or be developed into therapeutic agents in the fight against pain.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9143cf058f61000cd6b","authors":["Xueyin Chen","Jinyuan Zhang","Xiangrui Wang"],"doi":"10.14310\/horm.2002.1696","first_seen_on":"2017-04-18T10:08:50+00:00","issns":["11093099"],"issue":"3","journal":"Hormones international journal of endocrinology and metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1492511177,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27838602?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27838602","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Hormones in pain modulation and their clinical implications for pain control: a critical review","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hormones-pain-modulation-clinical-implications-pain-control-critical-review-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082745,"mean":6.8630429413494,"rank":6138320,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1085549,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082745,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232795,"mean":12.76104647027,"rank":164942,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":43223,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232795,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123,"mean":2.5759836065574,"rank":78,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.375,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"EG":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/painmanwise\/statuses\/854275389056851968","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18924362],"posted_on":"2017-04-18T10:08:19+00:00","author":{"name":"painmanwise","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/514094062056390656\/ORtXawZi_normal.png","id_on_source":"painmanwise","tweeter_id":"2826634074","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":129},"tweet_id":"854275389056851968"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/aghoury79\/statuses\/854279912634671104","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18924362],"posted_on":"2017-04-18T10:26:17+00:00","author":{"name":"Ahmed Elaghoury","url":"http:\/\/eg.linkedin.com\/in\/aghoury","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/749706574990573568\/1hdbWkTG_normal.jpg","description":"Physician specialized & blogging in psychiatry, sleep medicine & related neurology.","id_on_source":"aghoury79","tweeter_id":"55548061","geo":{"lt":31.21564,"ln":29.95527,"country":"EG"},"followers":2031},"tweet_id":"854279912634671104"}]}}
