In this work, a sample was obtained from A. officinarum rhizomes by supercritical fluid CO\u2082 extraction (SFE). According to GC-MS analysis, the main chemical components for SFE-sample included benzylacetone (26.77%), 1,7-diphenyl-5-hydroxy-3-heptanone (17.78%), guaiacylacetone (10.03%) and benzenepropanal (7.42%). The essential oil of A. officinarum rhizomes (LD50 = 20.71 \u03bcg\/adult) exhibited more contact toxicity than SFE extract (LD50 = 82.72 \u03bcg\/adult) against Tribolium castaneum. From SFE extracts, one new compound, 1-phenyl-4-(16,17-dimethyl-9,13-octadiene)-5-isopentenyl-7-(4\"-methoxyl-3\"-hydroxyl-phenyl)-3-heptanone (3), together with five known compounds identified as 5-hydroxy-1,7-diphenyl-3-heptanone (1), 1,7-diphenyl-4-hepten-3-one (2), galangin (4), galangin-3-methyl ether (5) and pinocembrin (6), were isolated and their feeding deterrent activities against T. castaneum adults were assessed. It was found that compounds 1-6 had feeding deterrent activities against T. castaneum with feeding deterrent indices of 18.21%, 18.94%, 19.79%, 26.99%, 20.34%, and 35.81%, respectively, at the concentration of 1500 ppm. Hence, the essential oil and SFE extracts\/compounds of A. officinarum rhizomes represent promising alternatives in the control of T. castaneum adults.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422e","authors":["Mintong Xin","Shanshan Guo","Wenjuan Zhang","Zhufeng Geng","Junyu Liang","Shushan Du","Zhiwei Deng","Yongyan Wang"],"doi":"10.3390\/molecules22040647","first_seen_on":"2017-04-18T09:07:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1420-3049"],"issue":"4","journal":"Molecules","last_mentioned_on":1492684055,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/22\/4\/647?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28420198?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/22\/4\/647\/pdf","pmid":"28420198","pubdate":"2017-04-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Chemical Constituents of Supercritical Extracts from Alpinia officinarum and the Feeding Deterrent Activity against Tribolium castaneum","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chemical-constituents-supercritical-extracts-alpinia-officinarum-feeding-deterrent-activity-against"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8089090,"mean":6.870452360944,"rank":4041972,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3841318,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8089090,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233435,"mean":12.769698073117,"rank":118659,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":104674,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233435,"percentile":44},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3779,"mean":2.1561810481736,"rank":968,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":2642,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3779,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":434,"mean":0.8726558891455,"rank":77,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":330,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":434,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/P_Doggy_Bone\/statuses\/854260015082819584","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18923169],"posted_on":"2017-04-18T09:07:13+00:00","author":{"name":"Precious Daniel\u2122","url":"http:\/\/facebook.com\/precious.ogunleye","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/891043583511470080\/FfBKDjay_normal.jpg","description":"All I want is to be RICH and FAMOUS through God's blessings.
