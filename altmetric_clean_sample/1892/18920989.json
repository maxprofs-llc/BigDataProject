On a molecular level, the condition is characterized by widespread cell death and poor regeneration, which can result in severe morbidity in survivors. Potential therapeutics are of major interest, with a promising candidate being brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a ubiquitous agent in the brain which has been associated with neural development and may facilitate protective and regenerative effects following injury. This review summarizes the available information on the potential benefits of BDNF and the molecular mechanisms involved in several pathological conditions, including hypoxic brain injury, stroke, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. It further explores the methods in which BDNF can be applied in clinical and therapeutic settings, and the potential challenges to overcome.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002427","authors":["Hailin Zhao","Azeem Alam","Chun-Yin San","Shiori Eguchi","Qian Chen","Qingquan Lian","Daqing Ma"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.brainres.2017.03.029","first_seen_on":"2017-04-18T05:44:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00068993"],"journal":"Brain Research","last_mentioned_on":1492494244,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0006899317301440"],"pmid":"28396009","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["brain"],"title":"Molecular mechanisms of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in neuro-protection: Recent developments","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-mechanisms-brainderived-neurotrophic-factor-neuroprotection-recent-developments"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082745,"mean":6.8630429413494,"rank":6997215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082745,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232794,"mean":12.761168944083,"rank":189575,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232794,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3506,"mean":3.786422253923,"rank":2959,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3506,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":3.1894736842105,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
