Fourier transform near infrared spectroscopy (FT-NIRS) combined with chemometric algorithms like partial least square (PLS); synergy interval-PLS (Si-PLS); synergy interval-genetic algorithm-PLS (Si-GAPLS); Ant colony optimization - PLS (ACO-PLS) and competitive-adaptive reweighted sampling-PLS (CARS-PLS) was employed to predict TFC in cocoa beans neat solution. Model results were evaluated using the correlation coefficients of the prediction (Rp) and calibration (Rc); root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP), and the ratio of sample standard deviation to RMSEP (RPD). The developed models performance yielded 0.951\u2264Rp\u22640.975; and 3.15\u2264RPD\u22644.32. The models' prediction stability improved in the order of PLS<CARS-PLS<ACO-PLS<Si-PLS<Si-GAPLS. FT-NIRS combined with Si-GAPLS may be employed for in-situ and noninvasive quantification of TFC in cocoa beans for quality and safety monitoring.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028f5","authors":["Kutsanedzie, Felix Y.H.","Chen, Quansheng","Hassan, Md Mehedi","Yang, Mingxiu","Sun, Hao","Rahman, Md Hafizur"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.foodchem.2017.07.117","first_seen_on":"2017-07-30T19:26:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0308-8146","03088146"],"journal":"Food Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1501662587,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0308814617312700","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0308814617312700?utm_source=twitter.com\/CalibModel&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28946266","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Near infrared system coupled chemometric algorithms for enumeration of total fungi count in cocoa beans neat solution","type":"article","volume":"240","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/near-infrared-system-coupled-chemometric-algorithms-enumeration-total-fungi-count-cocoa-beans-neat-s"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8314034,"mean":7.0059620328577,"rank":4427023,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2314675,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8314034,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180106,"mean":11.73471487188,"rank":98491,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":63950,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180106,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3475,"mean":3.8617345998849,"rank":1450,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1572,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3475,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103,"mean":3.2717647058824,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":60,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CH":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/carladmartin\/statuses\/891741733490483203","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23271991],"posted_on":"2017-07-30T19:26:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Carla D.
