The method investigated in this study integrates the extraction of crude proteins with recovery of minerals rich sap, lipids, ulvan and cellulose from fresh biomass of Ulva lactuca. The protein content extracted was 11\u00b12.12% on dry weight basis with recovery efficiency of 68.75\u00b14.01%. The amino acid composition of crude protein fraction showed iso-leucine as the most abundant amino acid with 16.51\u00b10.03% followed by histidine, arginine, tyrosine, serine, aspartic acid, threonine, phenyl alanine, leucine, alanine, lysine, glycine and glutamic acid (0.22\u00b10.24%). The digestibility of protein was as high as 85.86\u00b15.92% indicating its suitability for use in food supplements. The protein production with co-recovery of other products would not only result in effective utilisation marine macroalgal resources but also forms the basis for marine bio-economy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f5","authors":["Gajaria, Tejal K.","Suthar, Poornima","Baghel, Ravi S.","B.Balar, Nikunj","Sharnagat, Preeti","Mantri, Vaibhav A.","Reddy, C.R.K.","Balar, Nikunj B."],"doi":"10.1016\/j.biortech.2017.06.149","first_seen_on":"2017-07-18T14:28:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0960-8524","09608524","1873-2976"],"journal":"Bioresource Technology","last_mentioned_on":1500585608,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0960852417310532","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/authShare\/S0960852417310532\/20170718T115900Z\/1?md5=45d6cefb0a9379e837e2f7597fb3c187"],"pmid":"28738503","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Integration of protein extraction with a stream of byproducts from marine macroalgae: a model forms the basis for marine bioeconomy","type":"article","volume":"243","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/integration-protein-extraction-stream-byproducts-marine-macroalgae-model-forms-basis-marine-bioecono"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.85,"score_history":{"1y":5.85,"6m":5.85,"3m":5.85,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8248040,"mean":6.9694059574582,"rank":1449261,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":6794046,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8248040,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170208,"mean":11.670208534314,"rank":37587,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":132490,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170208,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2132,"mean":2.2214838104176,"rank":163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":1969,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2132,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99,"mean":1.6634693877551,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":91,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":8}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
