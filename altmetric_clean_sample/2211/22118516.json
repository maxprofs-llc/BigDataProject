Booster cushion usage in China is low, and there are no studies showing how a population with limited experience handles booster cushions during buckling up. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the handling of and explore the attitudes toward, booster cushions among children, parents and grandparents in Shanghai.\nAn observational study including, a convenience sample of 254 children aged 4-12\u00a0years, was conducted in two passenger cars at a shopping center in Shanghai. Parents, grandparents, or the children themselves, buckled up the child on two types of booster cushions; a two-stage integrated booster cushion (IBC), and an aftermarket booster cushion (BC). The test participants were observed during buckling up, first without and then with instructions. The test leaders conducted structured interviews.\n98% of the uninstructed participants failed to buckle up without identified misuse on the aftermarket booster cushion, and 31% of those uninstructed on the integrated booster cushion. The majority of misuse was severe, including placing the belt behind the arm, and the lap belt routing above the guiding loops. Instruction reduced misuse to 58% (BC), and 12% (IBC), respectively, and, in particular, severe misuse. Some misuse was related to limited knowledge of how to buckle up on the booster cushion, and some misuse was intentional in order to reduce discomfort. The participants, both children and adults, reported they preferred the IBC due to good comfort and convenience. Safety was reported as the main reason for adults using booster cushions in general, while children reported comfort as the most important motivation.\nEducation is needed to ensure frequent and correct use of booster cushions in China, and to raise safety awareness among children and adults. Furthermore, it is important that the booster cushions offer intuitively correct usage to a population with limited experience of booster cushions. This is the first study published on the handling of and attitude toward booster cushions after child restraints laws were introduced in Shanghai 2014.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d63cf058f6100010df","authors":["Katarina Bohman","Sofia Jorl\u00f6v","Shengqi Zhou","Cloud Zhao","Bo Sui","Chengkai Ding"],"doi":"10.1080\/15389588.2016.1143554","first_seen_on":"2017-07-18T14:56:37+00:00","issns":["1538-9588","1538-957X"],"journal":"Traffic Injury Prevention","last_mentioned_on":1500386707,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26891340?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26891340","pubdate":"2016-10-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Automotive Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Misuse of booster cushions among children and adults in Shanghai\u2014an observational and attitude study during buckling up","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/misuse-booster-cushions-among-children-adults-shanghaian-observational-attitude-study-during-bucklin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8229472,"mean":6.9710874477773,"rank":7121615,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8229472,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163880,"mean":11.676150232794,"rank":134001,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163880,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":870,"mean":2.8525960874568,"rank":546,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":870,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.04,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"BA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/tomheston\/statuses\/887312279615688704","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22118516],"posted_on":"2017-07-18T14:05:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Tom Heston","url":"http:\/\/tomheston.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/452650157050302464\/-kGG7sgd_normal.png","description":"I help people make wise health decisions.
