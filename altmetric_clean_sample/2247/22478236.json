Save the Children Federation helped schools in Mangochi District, Malawi, to obtain pupil-treatment kits, which enabled teachers to dispense sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine tablets according to national guidelines. The overall and malaria-specific mortality rates were calculated for the 3 years before and 2 years after the intervention was introduced; rates dropped from 2.2 to 1.44 deaths\/1000 student-years and from 1.28 to 0.44 deaths\/1000 student-years, respectively. School-based interventions could play a part in mitigating malaria.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008b2a","authors":["Omrana Pasha","Joy Del Rosso","Mary Mukaka","David Marsh"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0140-6736(03)12511-1","first_seen_on":"2017-07-26T14:23:41+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["01406736","0140-6736"],"issue":"9357","journal":"The Lancet","last_mentioned_on":1230768000,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0140-6736(03)12511-1"],"pmid":"12598146","pubdate":"2003-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"The effect of providing fansidar (sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine) in schools on mortality in school-age children in Malawi","type":"article","volume":"361","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-providing-fansidar-sulfadoxinepyrimethamine-schools-mortality-schoolage-children-malawi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8122022,"mean":6.8852755184873,"rank":2050175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4953602,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8122022,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96842,"mean":10.916075278033,"rank":30009,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":65826,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96842,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24113,"mean":26.453579711347,"rank":12866,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":5772,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24113,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178,"mean":57.264711864407,"rank":124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
