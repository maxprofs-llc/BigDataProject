There is an urgent need to identify novel markers with prognostic and therapeutic value for MCL. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as key regulators in cancers, including MCL. Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1(MALAT1), a lncRNA located at pathognomonic translocation site of t (11; 14) of MCL. MALAT1 is known to be overexpressed in solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. However, the pathological role and clinical relevance of MALAT1 in MCL are not completely understood.\nWe quantified MALAT1 in MCL samples (40) and CD19+\u00a0B cells by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and correlated levels with clinical outcome. We silenced MALAT1 in MCL cell lines and analyzed cells in tumorigenic assays and formation of transcription complexes.\nWe found that the expression of MALAT1 was elevated in human MCL tumors and cell lines as compared to normal controls, and the elevated levels of MALAT1 correlated with higher MCL international prognostic index (MIPI) and reduced overall survival. MCL with knockdown of MALAT1 showed impaired cell proliferation, facilitated apoptosis and produced fewer clonogenic foci. The increased expression of p21 and p27 upon MALAT1 knockdown was regulated by enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2). Moreover, decreased phosphorylation of EZH2 at T350 attenuated the binding to MALAT1.\nOur findings illuminate the oncogenic role of MALAT1, which may serve as a novel biomarker and as a therapeutic target in MCL.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000865","authors":["Xin Wang","Lalit Sehgal","Neeraj Jain","Tamer Khashab","Rohit Mathur","Felipe Samaniego"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12967-016-1100-9","first_seen_on":"2016-12-21T02:07:18+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1479-5876"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Translational Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1482286025,"links":["http:\/\/translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12967-016-1100-9?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+JournalOfTranslationalMedicine-LatestArticles+%28Journal+of+Translational+Medicine%29"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12967-016-1100-9?site=translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com","pmcid":"PMC5175387","pmid":"27998273","pubdate":"2016-12-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"346","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"LncRNA MALAT1 promotes development of mantle cell lymphoma by associating with EZH2","type":"article","uri":"\/\/translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12967-016-1100-9","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lncrna-malat1-promotes-development-mantle-cell-lymphoma-associating-ezh2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7917108,"mean":6.6979661075636,"rank":4152451,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2208234,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7917108,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251086,"mean":12.400222721389,"rank":139876,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":87433,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251086,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1790,"mean":5.6131179429849,"rank":1010,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1790,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":4.2073333333333,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
