This is modulated by a triad of factors, including decreased arousal in the brain, a decreased urine production rate in the kidneys and increased functional bladder capacity during sleep. The circadian clock is genetic transcription-translation feedback machinery. It exists in most organs and cells, termed the peripheral clock, which is orchestrated by the central clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain. We discuss the linkage between the day and night change in micturition frequency and the genetic rhythm maintained by the circadian clock system, focusing on the brain, kidney and bladder.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f12","authors":["Negoro, Hiromitsu","Kanematsu, Akihiro","Yoshimura, Koji","Ogawa, Osamu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.juro.2013.02.024","first_seen_on":"2013-02-20T16:42:55+00:00","issns":["0022-5347"],"journal":"The Journal of Urology","last_mentioned_on":1387211380,"links":["http:\/\/www.jurology.com\/article\/PIIS0022534713002930\/abstract?rss=yes","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23429068?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jurology.com\/article\/S0022-5347(13)00293-0\/pdf","pmid":"23429068","pubdate":"2013-02-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Chronobiology of micturition: putative role of the circadian clock","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chronobiology-micturition-putative-role-circadian-clock"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":946830,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":3549542,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89372,"mean":6.2949060881047,"rank":21446,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":67574,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89372,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5286,"mean":2.4080605487228,"rank":733,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":4536,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5286,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185,"mean":2.5266304347826,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":158,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
