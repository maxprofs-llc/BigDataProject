Here, we report a case in which the immunohistochemistry of CD10 was a pitfall in the differential diagnosis of a metastatic seminoma, and further present a brief study of CD10 expression in a seminoma series. A 67-year-old man, who had a history of lobectomy of the lung due to squamous cell carcinoma 2 years prior, showed lymphadenopathy of the neck and the paraaorta on follow-up study by fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission computer tomography scan. The biopsy of the cervical node demonstrated infiltration of large atypical cells. The results of the screening immunohistochemistry were CD20(-), CD3(-), CD10(+), CD30(-), AE1\/AE3(-), and placental alkaline phosphatase(-), providing the impression of CD10-positive lymphoma. However, the following studies revealed germ cell characteristics [OCT3\/4(+), SALL4(+), and CLDN6(+)], confirming the diagnosis of seminoma. We further evaluated CD10 expression in a series of seminomas (n=16). Strong positivity was observed in 14 cases; partial and weak positivity, in 2 cases. These findings should be considered in the differential diagnosis of seminoma.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8203cf058f61000bc2b","authors":["Ota Y","Iihara K","Ryu T","Morikawa T","Fukayama M"],"first_seen_on":"2013-02-22T10:06:22+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"3","journal":"International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1361521209,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23411938?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC3563185","pmid":"23411938","pubdate":"2013-02-17T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Metastatic seminomas in lymph nodes: CD10 immunoreactivity can be a pitfall of differential diagnosis.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metastatic-seminomas-lymph-nodes-cd10-immunoreactivity-pitfall-differential-diagnosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":3078418,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":957897,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89439,"mean":6.3195215903756,"rank":59872,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":18879,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89439,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":836,"mean":0.94820359281437,"rank":280,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":410,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":836,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":1.1020833333333,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
