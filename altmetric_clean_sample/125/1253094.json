Our study provides a better understanding of the nature of DCD and its etiology, and identifies subtypes of dyspraxia. Forty-three children with DCD (5-15 years) were enrolled on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed. [DSM-IV-TR]; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) criteria. Extensive standardized evaluations were conducted. We distinguished from two patterns of \"pure\" developmental dyspraxia: ideomotor and visual-spatial\/visual-constructional, and mix dyspraxia with more co-morbidities. Our study provides a better understanding of the nature of DCD, and sheds light on its etiology and brain dysfunction, so as to identify subtypes of developmental DCD\/dyspraxia with specific clinical criteria.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4da3cf058f610001669","authors":[" Laurence   Vaivre-Douret ","Vaivre-Douret L","Lalanne C","Ingster-Moati I","Boddaert N","Cabrol D","Dufier JL","Golse B","Falissard B"],"doi":"10.1080\/87565641.2011.560696","first_seen_on":"2013-02-20T17:16:29+00:00","issns":["8756-5641","1532-6942"],"issue":"5","journal":"Developmental Neuropsychology","last_mentioned_on":1362086030,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/87565641.2011.560696","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/87565641.2011.560696#.US_ILQJjIWc.facebook"],"pmid":"21667364","pubdate":"2011-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Psychology Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology","neurology"],"title":"Subtypes of Developmental Coordination Disorder: Research on Their Nature and Etiology","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/subtypes-developmental-coordination-disorder-research-nature-etiology"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628824,"mean":4.9380564480592,"rank":2698836,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":885005,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628824,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85546,"mean":6.0305082471215,"rank":58328,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":25511,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85546,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":3.4584,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.425,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
