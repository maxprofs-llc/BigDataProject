All speech signals were captured and recorded using a Temco HG-17 BCM. Twelve locations on or close to the skull were selected for the BCM placement. In the first study, listeners evaluated the intelligibility and quality of the bone conducted speech signals presented through traditional earphones. Listeners in the second study evaluated the intelligibility and quality of signals presented through a loudspeaker. In the third study the signals were reproduced through a bone conduction headset; however, signal evaluation was limited to speech intelligibility only. In all three studies, the Forehead and Temple BCM locations yielded the highest intelligibility and quality rating scores. The Collarbone location produced the least intelligible and lowest quality signals across all tested BCM locations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022d2","authors":["McBride M","Tran P","Letowski T","Patrick R"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.apergo.2010.09.004","first_seen_on":"2013-02-20T13:01:24+00:00","issns":["0003-6870"],"issue":"3","journal":"Applied Ergonomics","last_mentioned_on":1361364761,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20934172"],"pmid":"20934172","pubdate":"2010-10-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Design Practice And Management","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"The effect of bone conduction microphone locations on speech intelligibility and sound quality.","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-bone-conduction-microphone-locations-speech-intelligibility-sound-quality"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3616387,"mean":4.9300280987737,"rank":2015243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":924433,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3616387,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85376,"mean":6.0432143836017,"rank":43181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":27170,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85376,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253,"mean":4.0812936507937,"rank":135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.505,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
