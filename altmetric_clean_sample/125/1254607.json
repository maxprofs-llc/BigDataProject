We present an immunocompetent patient with multifocal leukoencephalopathy on HAART, with central nervous system (CNS) IRIS pathology of unknown infectious etiology. CNS IRIS pathology should be suspected in patients on longstanding HAART without immune reconstitution, presenting with unexplained leukoencephalopathy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc9c","authors":["Alejandro Hornik","Federico Rodriguez-Porcel","Shawn Wallery","Murray Flaster","John M.
