Global change is proposed to influence both C uptake and release in these ecosystems, thereby potentially affecting whether they act as C sources or sinks. Bryophytes (i.e., mosses) serve a variety of key functions in these systems, including their association with nitrogen (N2 )-fixing cyanobacteria, as thermal insulators of the soil, and producers of recalcitrant litter, which have implications for both net primary productivity (NPP) and heterotrophic respiration. While ground-cover bryophytes typically make up a small proportion of the total biomass in northern systems, their combined physical structure and N2 -fixing capabilities facilitate a disproportionally large impact on key processes that control ecosystem C and N cycles. As such, the response of bryophyte-cyanobacteria associations to global change may influence whether and how ecosystem C balances are influenced by global change. Here, we review what is known about their occurrence and N2 -fixing activity, and how bryophyte systems will respond to several key global change factors. We explore the implications these responses may have in determining how global change influences C balances in high northern latitudes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002974","authors":["Lindo, Zo\u00eb","Nilsson, Marie\u2010Charlotte","Gundale, Michael J."],"doi":"10.1111\/gcb.12175","endpage":"2035","first_seen_on":"2013-02-21T12:26:24+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1365-2486","1354-1013"],"issue":"7","journal":"Global Change Biology","last_mentioned_on":1370503003,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/gcb.12175","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/gcb.12175\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/gcb.12175\/pdf","pmid":"23505142","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"2022","title":"Bryophyte\u00e2\u0080\u0090cyanobacteria associations as regulators of the northern latitude carbon balance in response to global change","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bryophytecyanobacteria-associations-regulators-northern-latitude-carbon-balance-response-global-chan"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6695822,"mean":6.1596152907889,"rank":2695107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":3933525,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6695822,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111200,"mean":6.2047235316865,"rank":40826,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":68841,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111200,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2073,"mean":14.711176640927,"rank":1504,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":536,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2073,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":4.5375555555556,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Researcher":21,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
