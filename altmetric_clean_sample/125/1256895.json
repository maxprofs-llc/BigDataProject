The overall base composition of the H-strand is 27.0% T, 28.0% C, 28.6% A, and 16.3% G. The CO1 gene is initiated by GTG codon and ATP6 gene is initiated by TTG codon. The tRNA-Ser2 cannot be folded into the typical cloverleaf secondary structure because its dihydrouridine arm is replaced by a simple loop. A long-tandem repeat motif (76\u00a0bp), repeated six times, is found in the control region.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f610004220","authors":["Binyuan He","Tinghe Lai","Zaiqing Peng","Xin Wang","Lianghao Pan"],"doi":"10.3109\/19401736.2013.770503","first_seen_on":"2013-02-22T10:49:59+00:00","issns":["1940-1736","1940-1744"],"journal":"Mitochondrial DNA: The Journal of DNA Mapping, Sequencing & Analysis","last_mentioned_on":1361507215,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/19401736.2013.770503"],"pmid":"23425075","pubdate":"2013-02-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"130221042922005","subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Complete mitogenome of the Areolate grouper Epinephelus areolatus (Serranidae, Epinephelinae).","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/complete-mitogenome-areolate-grouper-epinephelus-areolatus-serranidae-epinephelinae"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628077,"mean":4.9442940120368,"rank":2904704,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75224,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628077,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85642,"mean":6.0566110858118,"rank":65554,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":253,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85642,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":945,"mean":0.62233898305085,"rank":253,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":945,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98,"mean":0.27319587628866,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/IHC_CellBiology\/status\/304809470117163008","citation_ids":[1256895],"posted_on":"2013-02-22T04:26:55+00:00","author":{"name":"Cell Biology","url":"http:\/\/informahealthcare.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1253708030\/IHC-Twitter-profile-cell-biology2_normal.png","description":"Informa Healthcare's Cell Biology portfolio consists of 19 peer-reviewed journals designed to help you find the information you need for your research.","id_on_source":"IHC_CellBiology","tweeter_id":"140452905","geo":{"lt":"51.5072759","ln":"-0.1276597","country":"GB"},"followers":515},"tweet_id":"304809470117163008"}]}}
