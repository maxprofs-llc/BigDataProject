Clinical pathway informatics is regarded as an efficient way to solve a series of hospital challenges. To date, conventional research lacks a mathematical model to describe clinical pathways. Existing vague descriptions cannot fully capture the complexities accurately in clinical pathways and hinders the effective management and further optimization of clinical pathways.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007a9","authors":["Yang X","Han R","Guo Y","Bradley J","Cox B","Dickinson R","Kitney R"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2105-13-s14-s4","first_seen_on":"2013-02-21T15:41:37+00:00","issns":[""],"issue":"","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","last_mentioned_on":1361792166,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23095226"],"pmid":"23095226","pubdate":"2012-10-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Algorithms","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Bioinformatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Combinatorial Libraries","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Computational Biology\/Bioinformatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Computer Appl. in Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microarrays","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Computer Science"],"subjects":["computationalbiology"],"title":"Modelling and performance analysis of clinical pathways using the stochastic process algebra PEPA.","type":"article","volume":"13 Suppl 14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/modelling-performance-analysis-clinical-pathways-using-stochastic-process-algebra-pepa-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628824,"mean":4.9380564480592,"rank":1530649,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":1999176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628824,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85541,"mean":6.0536337853637,"rank":29009,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":54623,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85541,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2289,"mean":4.2753618881119,"rank":1170,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":1060,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2289,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":129,"mean":3.922,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":129,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
