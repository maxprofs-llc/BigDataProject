In the ECHO and THRIVE trials comparing EFV with another NNRTI, rilpivirine (RPV), both medications had similar virologic suppression rates at 96-weeks; however, RPV had higher rates of virologic failure and drug resistance and lower rates of discontinuation due to adverse events. This study compared the cost-effectiveness of EFV to RPV in first-line HIV treatment in the US.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d4f","authors":[" Machaon Bonafede"],"doi":"10.3111\/13696998.2013.774280","first_seen_on":"2013-02-22T10:54:10+00:00","issns":["1369-6998"],"journal":"Journal of Medical Economics","last_mentioned_on":1361508736,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3111\/13696998.2013.774280?ai=90m&mi=3b4gaf&af=R&"],"pmid":"23391157","pubdate":"2013-02-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Economics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["healthservices"],"title":"Cost-effectiveness of efavirenz vs rilpivirine in HIV patients initiating first-line combination antiretroviral therapy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/costeffectiveness-efavirenz-vs-rilpivirine-hiv-patients-initiating-firstline-combination-antiretrovi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":3079499,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":959260,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89439,"mean":6.3122345982692,"rank":60055,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":19255,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89439,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":480,"mean":1.9548058455115,"rank":339,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":480,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":1.3636097560976,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":4,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Social Sciences":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Business, Management and Accounting":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Arts and Humanities":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/JME_Journal\/status\/304815848240082944","citation_ids":[1256936],"posted_on":"2013-02-22T04:52:16+00:00","author":{"name":"J of Med Economics","url":"http:\/\/www.jmejournal.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/844905347110354944\/XOl7nnWF_normal.jpg","description":"MEDLINE indexed, peer-reviewed journal publishing leading studies that determine the cost-effectiveness of treatment, and high-quality economic assessments.","id_on_source":"JME_Journal","tweeter_id":"31438354","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1135},"tweet_id":"304815848240082944"}]}}
