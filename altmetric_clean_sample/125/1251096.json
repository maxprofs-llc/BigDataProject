Here, we experimentally demonstrated the resonant amplification of vortex oscillations by application of simple coherent field pulses tuned to optimal width and time intervals. In order to investigate vortex excitations on the sub-ns time scale, we employed state-of-the-art time-resolved full-field soft X-ray microscopy of 70 ps temporal and 25 nm lateral resolution. We found that, due to the resonant enhancement of the vortex gyration motion, the signal input power can be significantly reduced to ~ 1 Oe in field strength, while increasing signal gains, by increasing the number of the optimal field pulses. We identified the origin of this behavior as the forced resonant amplification of vortex gyration. This work represents an important milestone towards the potential implementation of vortex oscillations in future magnetic vortex devices.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Young-Sang Yu","Dong-Soo Han","Myoung-Woo Yoo","Ki-Suk Lee","Youn-Seok Choi","Hyunsung Jung","Jehyun Lee","Mi-Young Im","Peter Fischer","Sang-Koog Kim"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep01301","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2013-02-20T05:57:52+00:00","issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1397475338,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/srep\/2013\/130218\/srep01301\/full\/srep01301.html"],"pmid":"23416729","pubdate":"2013-02-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Spintronics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Magnetic devices","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"X-rays","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Magnetic properties and materials","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"","subjects":["science"],"title":"Resonant amplification of vortex-core oscillations by coherent magnetic-field pulses","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/resonant-amplification-vortexcore-oscillations-coherent-magneticfield-pulses"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3658512,"mean":4.9431488777853,"rank":1823660,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1654680,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3658512,"percentile":45},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85686,"mean":6.0172961195075,"rank":36836,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":43438,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85686,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6977,"mean":10.724769495413,"rank":3581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":2954,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6977,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":416,"mean":8.3953108433735,"rank":268,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":416,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
