There is, however, little evidence of any risk of MVA attributable to the use of zolpidem 1 day before such accidents. We attempted to determine whether the use of zolpidem 1 day before is associated with an increased risk of an MVA.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa85f3cf058f61000c5c3","authors":["Yang YH","Lai JN","Lee CH","Wang JD","Chen PC"],"first_seen_on":"2013-02-22T10:17:19+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Epidemiology","last_mentioned_on":1361518492,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21030794"],"pmid":"21030794","pubdate":"2010-10-31T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["epidemiology"],"title":"Increased risk of hospitalization related to motor vehicle accidents among people taking zolpidem: a case-crossover study.","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increased-risk-hospitalization-related-motor-vehicle-accidents-among-people-taking-zolpidem-casecros"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629479,"mean":4.9344089205159,"rank":2900997,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":78050,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629479,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85659,"mean":6.0393888720261,"rank":65465,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":319,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85659,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":141,"mean":4.1996857142857,"rank":99,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":141,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.375,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
