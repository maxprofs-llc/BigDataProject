On the basis of our calculations, several protection mechanisms are proposed in this work subject to the type of the amino acid. Our results indicate that a series of three-electron bonds can be formed between the amino acids and the guanine radical cation which may serve as relay stations supporting hole transport. In the three-electron-bonded, \u03c0-\u03c0-stacked, and H-bonded modes, amino acids can protect guanine from oxidation or radiation damage by sharing the hole, while amino acids with reducing properties can repair the guanine radical cation through proton-coupled electron transfer or electron transfer. Another important finding is that positively charged amino acids (ArgH(+), LysH(+), and HisH(+)) can inhibit ionization of guanine through raising its ionization potential. In this situation, a negative dissociation energy for hydrogen bonds in the hole-trapped and positively charged amino acid-Guanine dimer is observed, which explains the low hole-trapping efficiency. We hope that this work provides valuable information on how to protect DNA from oxidation- or radiation-induced damages in biological systems.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008dda","authors":["Zhao, Jing","Yang, Hongfang","Zhang, Meng","Bu, Yuxiang"],"doi":"10.1002\/cphc.201200979","endpage":"1042","first_seen_on":"2013-02-20T23:01:16+00:00","issns":["1439-7641","1439-4235"],"issue":"5","journal":"ChemPhysChem","last_mentioned_on":1361401253,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cphc.201200979\/abstract;jsessionid=E5913155A94C1AA56F6B7CF67241C7F6.d04t02?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+on+23+February+from+10%3A00-12%3A00+BST+%2805%3A00-07%3A00+EDT%29+for+essential+maintenance"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cphc.201200979\/pdf","pmid":"23427004","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u00e2\u0080\u0090VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
