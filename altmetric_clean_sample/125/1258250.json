Ancillary tests, including ocular and brain imaging studies, are used to assess the severity of intraocular inflammation and systemic manifestations of Beh\u00e7et disease, to identify latent infections and other medical conditions that might worsen with systemic treatment, and to monitor for adverse effects of drugs used. There are two diagnostic or classification criteria in general use by the uveitis community, one from Japan and one from an international group; both rely on a minimum number and\/or combination of clinical findings to identify Beh\u00e7et disease. Finally, several grading schemes have been proposed to assess severity of ocular disease and response to treatment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5303cf058f6100042cb","authors":["Annabelle A.
