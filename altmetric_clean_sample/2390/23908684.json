The degree of sulfation was evaluated from 0.11 to 0.75 using ion-chromatography. The structural characteristics of SYG (sulfation of yeast glucans) with a DS = 0.75 were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography\/gel-permeation chromatography and finally by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry. The SYG had lower viscosity and greater solubility than the native yeast glucans, suggesting that the conformation of the SYG had significantly changed. The results also showed that SYG had a significantly greater antioxidant activity in vivo compared to native yeast glucans.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422e","authors":["Hua Zhang","Jing Zhang","Ziluan Fan","Xintao Zhou","Lin Geng","Zhenyu Wang","Joe M.
