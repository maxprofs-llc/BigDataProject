Areas covered: The hallmarks of these diseases are frequently multifunctional disordered proteins displaying moonlighting and\/or chameleon features, which are challenging drug targets. A representative of these proteins is the disordered Tubulin Polymerization Promoting Protein (TPPP\/p25) expressed specifically in oligodendrocytes (OLGs) in normal brain. Its non-physiological level is tightly related to the etiology of PD and Multiple System Atrophy (TPPP\/p25 enrichment in inclusions of neurons and OLGs, respectively), multiple sclerosis (TPPP\/p25-positive OLG destruction), as well as glioma (loss of TPPP\/p25 expression). The established anti-proliferative potency of TPPP\/p25 may raise its influence in cancer development. The recognition that whereas too much TPPP\/p25 could kill neurons in PD, but its loss keeps cells alive in cancer could contribute to our understanding of the interrelationship of \"TPPP\/p25 diseases\". Expert commentary: The knowledge accumulated so far underlines the key roles of the multifunctional TPPP\/p25 in both physiological and diverse pathological processes, consequently its validation as drug target sorely needs a new innovative strategy that is briefly reviewed here.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073d9","authors":["Judit Ol\u00e1h","Philippe Bertrand","Judit Ov\u00e1di"],"doi":"10.1080\/14789450.2017.1304216","first_seen_on":"2017-03-10T17:16:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1478-9450","1744-8387"],"journal":"Expert Review of Proteomics","last_mentioned_on":1489624038,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28271739","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/14789450.2017.1304216?ai=1lx1s&mi=ianpxd&af=R"],"pmid":"28271739","pubdate":"2017-03-10T22:18:54+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"ROLE OF THE MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED TPPP\/p25 IN PARKINSON\u2019S AND RELATED DISEASES AND ITS THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/14789450.2017.1304216","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-microtubuleassociated-tpppp25-parkinsons-related-diseases-therapeutic-potential"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.25,"score_history":{"1y":9.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366012,"mean":7.0543497525808,"rank":944452,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7409327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366012,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242544,"mean":13.679587866893,"rank":44349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":197616,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242544,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":362,"mean":1.7193351800554,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":347,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":362,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":2.8292857142857,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"ROLE OF THE MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED TPPP\/p25 IN PARKINSON'S AND RELATED DISEASES AND ITS THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL.","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=29854406144&p=1pl&v=1&x=dRy6_1uIeaKcMnr39qaJZg","license":"public","citation_ids":[17207736],"posted_on":"2017-03-10T17:15:53+00:00","summary":".
