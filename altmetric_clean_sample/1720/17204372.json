However, comprehensive data are lacking in this regard, and the clinical characteristics of the disease remain unclear.\nA literature review was performed using PubMed and Ichushi-Web-the database of the Japan Medical Abstracts Society-to identify articles published between 1996 and 2015 describing patients with JHM-induced pneumonitis. The final cohort included 73 patients in 59 articles (7 in English; 52 in Japanese).\nAmong the various JHMs reported, sho-saiko-to was the most frequently used drug (26%), followed by sairei-to (16%), seishin-renshi-in (8%), and bofu-tsusyo-san (8%). These drugs commonly contain ougon (skullcap) and kanzo (liquorice). The mean age at pneumonitis diagnosis was 63.2 \u00b1 15.5 years (range: 7-89 years). The male\/female ratio was 44\/29. Sixty-five patients (89%) developed pneumonitis within 3 months of beginning JHM treatment. Bilateral ground-glass attenuations on chest computed tomography, as well as lymphocytosis with a low CD4\/CD8 T-cell ratio in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, were common findings. Twenty-six patients (36%) recovered from the pneumonitis after simply discontinuing the causative JHM. However, the remainder required immunosuppressive therapy, and 13 patients (18%) received mechanical ventilation. Importantly, three patients (4%) did not survive, with two showing pathological diffuse alveolar damage upon autopsy.\nClinicians should be cautious regarding JHM-induced pneumonitis, particularly when using drugs\/ingredients known to cause this complication, and during the early treatment period. Although most events are non-severe, critical cases should be recognized.","altmetric_jid":"537f30872a83eeb45a8b465d","authors":["Yasunori Enomoto, MD","Yutaro Nakamura, MD, PhD","Noriyuki Enomoto, MD, PhD","Tomoyuki Fujisawa, MD, PhD","Naoki Inui, MD, PhD","Takafumi Suda"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.resinv.2016.11.007","first_seen_on":"2017-03-10T15:30:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["22125345","2212-5353"],"issue":"2","journal":"Respiratory Investigation","last_mentioned_on":1489159799,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28274529","http:\/\/www.respiratoryinvestigation.com\/article\/S2212-5345(16)30205-2\/abstract"],"pmid":"28274529","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Japanese herbal medicine-induced pneumonitis: A review of 73 patients","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S2212534516302052","volume":"55","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/japanese-herbal-medicineinduced-pneumonitis-review-73-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336644,"mean":7.0294968595789,"rank":6326378,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1128669,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336644,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242033,"mean":13.666368976003,"rank":175702,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":40688,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242033,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":2.670367816092,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.875,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
