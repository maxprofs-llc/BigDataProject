Although cognitive rehabilitation (CR) has been investigated in amnesic type of MCI, we could not find any trial that rehabilitated na-MCI exclusively. We studied the effectiveness of CR on na-MCI.\nThis study was a blinded, randomized clinical trial. Individuals with age of 60 years or more, complete self-directedness and diagnosis of na-MCI, based on Neuropsychiatry Unit Cognitive assessment tool, were selected. The 51 patients were randomly assigned into three groups: CR, lifestyle (LS) modification, and the control group (CG). Neuropsychological tests for executive functioning were assessed at the baseline, after the interventions, and 6 months later.\nThe mean score of the \"design fluency\" test increased significantly in CR, compared to LS and CG (P = 0.007). In \"five-point\" test, mean score increased significantly in CR (P = 0.03). There was higher mean score of Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function for adults in CR (P = 0.01).\nConsideration of the MCI subtypes allows us to target specific cognitive domains, such as information processing, for better CR outcome. CR may result in better performance of executive functioning of daily living.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa67d3cf058f610009809","authors":["Majid Barekatain","Maryam Alavirad","Mahgol Tavakoli","Golita Emsaki","MohammadReza Maracy"],"doi":"10.4103\/1735-1995.193173","first_seen_on":"2017-03-10T17:17:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1735-1995"],"journal":"Journal of Research in Medical Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1489166157,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28250778"],"pmid":"28250778","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Cognitive rehabilitation in patients with nonamnestic mild cognitive impairment","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.jmsjournal.net\/text.asp?2016\/21\/1\/101\/193173","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cognitive-rehabilitation-patients-nonamnestic-mild-cognitive-impairment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336644,"mean":7.0294968595789,"rank":1217188,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":7044226,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336644,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242034,"mean":13.66628978693,"rank":54666,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":184582,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242034,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":368,"mean":3.9337111716621,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":320,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":368,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":3.75,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Cognitive rehabilitation in patients with nonamnestic mild cognitive impairment.","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=29854406932&p=1pl&v=1&x=MVGPi19cK_jqrUpqewrHbg","license":"public","citation_ids":[17207823],"posted_on":"2017-03-10T17:15:57+00:00","summary":".
