Here, we show that FAF1 is involved in negative regulation of NF-kappaB activation. Overexpression of FAF1 decreased the basal level of NF-kappaB activity in 293 cells. NF-kappaB activation induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin-1beta, and lipopolysaccharide was also inhibited by FAF1 overexpression. Moreover, FAF1 suppressed NF-kappaB activation induced by transducers of diverse NF-kappaB-activating signals such as TNF receptor-associated factor-2 and -6, MEKK1, and IkappaB kinase-beta as well as NF-kappaB p65, one of the end point molecules in the NF-kappaB activation pathway, suggesting that NF-kappaB p65 might be a target molecule upon which FAF1 acts. Subsequent study disclosed that FAF1 physically interacts with NF-kappaB p65 and that the binding domain of FAF1 is the death effector domain (DED)-interacting domain (amino acids 181-381), where DEDs of the Fas-associated death domain protein and caspase-8 interact. The NF-kappaB activity-modulating potential of FAF1 was also mapped to the DED-interacting domain. Finally, overexpression of FAF1 prevented translocation of NF-kappaB p65 into the nucleus and decreased its DNA-binding activity upon TNFalpha treatment. This study presents a novel function of FAF1, in addition to the previously known function as a component of the Fas death-inducing signaling complex, i.e. NF-kappaB activity suppressor by cytoplasmic retention of NF-kappaB p65 via physical interaction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Min-Young Park","Hyun Duk Jang","Soo Young Lee","Kong-Joo Lee","Eunhee Kim"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m304565200","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T09:51:00+00:00","issns":["1083-351X"],"journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1197986470,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1074\/jbc.M304565200","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14600157"],"pmid":"14600157","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Fas-associated factor-1 inhibits nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity by interfering with nuclear translocation of the RelA (p65) subunit of NF-kappaB.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fasassociated-factor1-inhibits-nuclear-factorb-nfb-activity-interfering-nuclear-translocation-rela-p"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628172,"mean":4.9437236464363,"rank":817267,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2287742,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628172,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95158,"mean":8.1603375264039,"rank":24703,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69368,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95158,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28042,"mean":2.6447118861667,"rank":1754,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":9979,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28042,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243,"mean":2.4327851239669,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
