Sequence analysis of clones obtained from a human breast adenocarcinoma MCF7 cDNA library suggests that at least three mRNA transcripts, differing in their 3'-untranslated regions, are transcribed from the hAG-2 gene. Northern blot analyses identified two principal hAG-2 signals in all ER-positive breast carcinoma cell lines that were absent in cell lines not expressing, or minimally expressing, ER. Coexpression of hAG-2 with ER suggests that hAG-2 may be involved in the tumor biology specific to the well-differentiated phenotype of hormonally-responsive breast cancers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","authors":["D A Thompson","R J Weigel"],"doi":"10.1006\/bbrc.1998.9440","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T06:55:32+00:00","issns":["0006-291X","0006291X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1198153363,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9790916","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1006\/bbrc.1998.9440"],"pmid":"9790916","pubdate":"1998-10-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"hAG-2, the Human Homologue of theXenopus laevisCement Gland Gene XAG-2, Is Coexpressed with Estrogen Receptor in Breast Cancer Cell Lines","type":"article","volume":"251","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hag2-human-homologue-xenopus-laevis-cement-gland-gene-xag2-coexpressed-estrogen-receptor-breast-canc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628371,"mean":4.9417862081361,"rank":817153,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288157,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628371,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95206,"mean":8.1654392521403,"rank":24725,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69396,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95206,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6517,"mean":2.5134981583794,"rank":216,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1948,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6517,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":140,"mean":1.1375251798561,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":130,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":140,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
