Three components of the p160 nuclear receptor coactivator complex, including CARM1, p300\/CBP, and GRIP1 (one of the p160 coactivators), bind to and cooperate with beta-catenin to enhance transcriptional activation by TCF\/LEF and AR. Here we report that another component of the p160 nuclear receptor coactivator complex, the coiled-coil coactivator (CoCoA), directly binds to and cooperates synergistically with beta-catenin as a coactivator for AR and TCF\/LEF. CoCoA uses different domains to bind GRIP1 and beta-catenin, and it uses different domains to transmit the activating signal to the transcription machinery, depending on whether it is bound to GRIP1 or beta-catenin. CoCoA associated specifically with the promoters of transiently transfected and endogenous target genes of TCF\/LEF, and reduction of the endogenous CoCoA level decreased the ability of TCF\/LEF and beta-catenin to activate transcription of transient and endogenous target genes. Thus, CoCoA uses different combinations of functional domains to serve as a physiologically relevant component of the Wnt\/beta-catenin signaling pathway and the androgen signaling pathway.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Catherine K.
