The phosphorylated residue in phosphomannomutase has now been identified by mass spectrometry after reduction of the phosphoenzyme with tritiated borohydride and trypsin digestion. It is the first aspartate in a conserved DVDGT motif. Replacement of either aspartate of this motif by asparagine or glutamate resulted in complete inactivation of the enzyme. The same mutations performed in the DXDST motif of L-3-phosphoserine phosphatase also resulted in complete inactivation of the enzyme, except for the replacement of the second aspartate by glutamate, which reduced the activity by only about 40%. This suggests that the first aspartate of the motif is also the phosphorylated residue in L-3-phosphoserine phosphatase. Data banks contained seven other phosphomutases or phosphatases sharing a similar, totally conserved DXDX(T\/V) motif at their amino terminus. One of these (beta-phosphoglucomutase) is shown to form a phosphoenzyme with the characteristics of an acyl-phosphate. In conclusion, phosphomannomutase and L-3-phosphoserine phosphatase belong to a new phosphotransferase family with an amino-terminal DXDX(T\/V) motif that serves as an intermediate phosphoryl acceptor.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["J F Collet","V Stroobant","M Pirard","G Delpierre","E Van Schaftingen"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T06:26:48+00:00","issns":["0021-9258"],"issue":"23","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1198216405,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9603909"],"pmid":"9603909","pubdate":"1998-06-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"A new class of phosphotransferases phosphorylated on an aspartate residue in an amino-terminal DXDX(T\/V) motif.","type":"article","volume":"273","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-class-phosphotransferases-phosphorylated-aspartate-residue-aminoterminal-dxdxtv-motif"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628371,"mean":4.9417862081361,"rank":817140,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288210,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628371,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95210,"mean":8.1658797382602,"rank":24726,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69399,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95210,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28042,"mean":2.6441213936736,"rank":1754,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":9982,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28042,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243,"mean":2.4327851239669,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
