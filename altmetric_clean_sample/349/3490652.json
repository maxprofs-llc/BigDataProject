The identity of eosinophil lysophospholipase and solubilized Charcot-Leyden crystal protein is now established by biochemical criteria, and a basis for the ease of aggregation and crystallization of the protein is identified in its prominent hydrophobicity. Chromatographically purified enzyme and Charcot-Leyden crystal protein formed in vitro functioned as lysophospholipases with identical Michaelis constants (Km approximately equal to 22 microM) for the substrate lysopalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and had blocked amino-terminal residues and almost identical amino acid compositions. The propensity of lysophospholipase to aggregate was not due to extensive intermolecular disulfide bonding because it contained a single cysteine residue as assessed by amino acid analyses and incorporated 0.986 mol of p-chloromercuribenzoic acid\/mol of native enzyme or 0.958 mol of iodoacetic acid\/mol of reduced and denatured enzyme. By equilibrium dialysis, lysophospholipase bound 3.820 g of detergent\/g of protein in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 0.506 g of detergent\/g of protein in 10 mM sodium deoxycholate. In addition, monomeric protein demonstrated enhanced binding of detergent as evidenced by its aberrantly rapid electrophoretic mobility in 1%, but not 0.1%, sodium dodecyl sulfate. The hydrophobic nature of this protein, which accounts for 10% of the protein of the eosinophil, may contribute to its unique propensity for crystallization in vivo.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["P F Weller","D S Bach","K F Austen"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T04:41:50+00:00","issns":["0021-9258"],"issue":"24","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1198018499,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/6511787"],"pmid":"6511787","pubdate":"1984-12-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Biochemical characterization of human eosinophil Charcot-Leyden crystal protein (lysophospholipase).","type":"article","volume":"259","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biochemical-characterization-human-eosinophil-charcotleyden-crystal-protein-lysophospholipase"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626596,"mean":4.9527436744422,"rank":817888,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2285254,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626596,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94769,"mean":8.101450763971,"rank":24538,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94769,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28039,"mean":2.6482489478565,"rank":1754,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":9954,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28039,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243,"mean":2.428652892562,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"BR":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"CLC (gene)","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=178821345#altmetric_citation_9","license":"public","citation_ids":[3490652],"posted_on":"2007-12-18T22:54:59+00:00","summary":"Eosinophil lysophospholipase is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the CLC gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14772961","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ProteinBoxBot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ProteinBoxBot"}}]}}
