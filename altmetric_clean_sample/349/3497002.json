In a search for protein kinases expressed in human epithelial tumour cells, we discovered two members of a novel protein kinase family [Dorow, D. S., Devereux, L., Dietzsch, E. & de Kretser, T. A. (1993) Eur. J. Biochem. 213, 701-710]. Due to the unique mixture of structural domains within their amino acid sequences, we named the family mixed-lineage kinases (MLK). We initially isolated clones encoding partial cDNAs of MLK1 and 2 from a human colonic cDNA library. The MLK2 cDNA was subsequently used to screen a human brain cDNA library and we have now cloned and sequenced a 3454-bp cDNA encoding the full-length MLK2 protein. The predicted MLK2 polypeptide has 954 amino acids and contains a src homology 3 (SH3) domain, a kinase catalytic domain, a double leucine zipper and basic domain, and a large C-terminal domain. The 22-amino-acid N-terminal region has four glutamic acid residues immediately following the initiator methionine. Beginning at amino acid 23, the 55-amino-acid SH3 domain contains a 5-amino-acid insert in a position corresponding to inserts of 6 and 15 residues in the SH3 domains of n-src and the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase. Adjacent to the SH3 domain is a kinase catalytic domain with conserved motifs associated with both serine\/threonine and tyrosine specificity. Beginning nine residues C-terminal to the catalytic domain, there are two leucine\/isoleucine zippers separated by a 13-amino-acid spacer sequence and followed by a stretch of basic residues. The polybasic sequence contains a motif that is similar to nuclear localisation signals from several proteins. The C-terminal domain is composed of 491 amino acids of which 17% are serine or threonine and 16% are proline. This domain also has a biased ratio of basic to acidic amino acids with a calculated pI of 9.38. When used as a probe to examine mRNA expression in human tissues, a MLK2 cDNA hybridised to a species of 3.8 kb that was expressed at highest levels in RNA from brain and skeletal muscle. The 3454-bp cDNA was also used for fluorescence in situ hybridisation to localise the MLK2 gene to human chromosome 19 q13.2.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002820","authors":["D S Dorow","L Devereux","G F Tu","G Price","J K Nicholl","G R Sutherland","R J Simpson"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T08:40:48+00:00","issns":["0014-2956"],"issue":"2","journal":"European Journal of Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1200937512,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8536694"],"pmid":"8536694","pubdate":"1995-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Complete nucleotide sequence, expression, and chromosomal localisation of human mixed-lineage kinase 2.","type":"article","volume":"234","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/complete-nucleotide-sequence-expression-chromosomal-localisation-human-mixedlineage-kinase-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4384254,"mean":4.8545329767884,"rank":983139,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2830184,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4384254,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146679,"mean":7.9026976915422,"rank":40864,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":103962,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146679,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2735,"mean":2.6218763716167,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":428,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2735,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
