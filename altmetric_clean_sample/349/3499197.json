Gurmarin, a 35-amino acid residue polypeptide recently discovered in an Indian-originated tree Gymnema sylvestre, selectively suppresses the neural responses of rat to sweet taste stimuli. Sequence-specific resonance assignments were obtained for all backbone protons and for most of the side-chain protons. The three-dimensional solution structure was determined by simulated-annealing calculations on the basis of 135 interproton distance constraints derived from NOEs, six distance constraints for three hydrogen bonds and 16 dihedral angle constraints derived from coupling constants. A total of 10 structures folded into a well-defined structure with a triple-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet. The average rmsd values between any two structures were 1.65 +\/- 0.39 A for the backbone atoms (N, C alpha, C) and 2.95 +\/- 0.27 A for all heavy atoms. The positions of the three disulfide bridges, which could not be determined chemically, were estimated to be Cys3-Cys18, Cys10-Cys23 and Cys17-Cys33 on the basis of the NMR distance constraints. This disulfide bridge pattern in gurmarin turned out to be analogous to that in omega-conotoxin and Momordica charantia trypsin inhibitor-II, and the topology of folding was the same as that in omega-conotoxin.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007b9d","authors":["K Arai","R Ishima","S Morikawa","A Miyasaka","T Imoto","S Yoshimura","S Aimoto","K Akasaka"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T09:57:44+00:00","issns":["0925-2738"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Biomolecular NMR","last_mentioned_on":1198438713,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7787425"],"pmid":"7787425","pubdate":"1995-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","nuclearmedicine"],"title":"Three-dimensional structure of gurmarin, a sweet taste-suppressing polypeptide.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/threedimensional-structure-gurmarin-sweet-tastesuppressing-polypeptide"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3619418,"mean":4.9283821178971,"rank":815641,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2280108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3619418,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93581,"mean":7.2521161145544,"rank":23743,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68754,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93581,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250,"mean":1.9322570281124,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":123,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.52272727272727,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
