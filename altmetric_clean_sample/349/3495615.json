Its cellular location is lysosomal with large amounts of the enzyme constitutively secreted. The highest levels of glutamyl hydrolase mRNA in humans is found in the liver and kidney. Baculovirus-expressed human enzyme has been used to evaluate the method of hydrolysis of methotrexate-gamma-glu4 and MTA-gamma-glu4. In both cases, the substrates are hydrolyzed by removal of the outer two gamma-glutamate linkages, yielding glu and gamma-glu2 as the glutamate products. Cell lines resistant to 5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate (lometrexol) have sevenfold higher activities of glutamyl hydrolase. These cultures have a 60% to 90% reduced amount of antifolate polygamma-glutamates and 30% reduced folyl poly-gamma-glutamates. These results suggest the possibility of using glutamyl hydrolase to favorably modulate the activity of antifolate therapy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005cd5","authors":["J Galivan","T Ryan","M Rhee","R Yao","K Chave"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T07:40:00+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0093-7754"],"issue":"2 Suppl 6","journal":"Seminars in oncology","last_mentioned_on":1371674684,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10598552"],"pmid":"10598552","pubdate":"1999-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Glutamyl hydrolase: properties and pharmacologic impact.","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/glutamyl-hydrolase-properties-pharmacologic-impact"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4600266,"mean":5.4093239416989,"rank":1068198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2961552,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4600266,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156377,"mean":9.0280867012842,"rank":46121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":108259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156377,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266,"mean":2.1285358490566,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":166,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":3.2306666666667,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Gamma-glutamyl hydrolase","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=560659064#altmetric_citation_6","license":"public","citation_ids":[3495615],"posted_on":"2013-06-19T20:44:44+00:00","summary":"Gamma-glutamyl hydrolase is an enzyme that catalyses the following chemical reaction:.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=39269130","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Boghog","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Boghog"}}]}}
