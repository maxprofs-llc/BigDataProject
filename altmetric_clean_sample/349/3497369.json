Diagnosis requires the presence of progressive encephalopathy with onset shortly after birth, and characteristic clinical neurological and neuroimaging signs together with chronic CSF lymphocytosis. The syndrome has superficial resemblance to the neurological sequelae of congenital infection, thus a rigorous search for microbiological and serological evidence of embryopathic infections should be carried out in each case.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6013cf058f6100062d0","authors":["J L Tolmie","P Shillito","R Hughes-Benzie","J B Stephenson"],"doi":"10.1136\/jmg.32.11.881","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T08:52:45+00:00","issns":["1468-6244","0022-2593"],"journal":"Journal of Medical Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1407399112,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/jmg.32.11.881","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8592332","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1051740"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jmg.bmj.com\/content\/32\/11\/881.full.pdf","pmid":"8592332","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"The Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome (familial, early onset encephalopathy with calcifications of the basal ganglia and chronic cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis).","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aicardigouti%C3%A8res-syndrome-familial-early-onset-encephalopathy-calcifications-basal-ganglia-chronic-c"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4115913,"mean":5.1087243297393,"rank":958231,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2595201,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4115913,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132863,"mean":9.1592320452803,"rank":41081,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":89911,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132863,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1235,"mean":4.1591150729335,"rank":414,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1235,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":7.242,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
