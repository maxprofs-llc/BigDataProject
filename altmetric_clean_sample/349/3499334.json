Here, we have used the Drosophila model system to provide the first functional evidence that human Scribble (hScrib) can act as a tumour suppressor. We show that hScrib protein displays highly polarized localization in mammalian epithelial cells and colocalizes with mammalian Dlg, similar to D. melanogaster Scribble (DmScrib) distribution in Drosophila epithelium. Furthermore, hScrib can rescue the polarity and tumorous overgrowth defects of scrib mutant Drosophila. hScrib therefore can act as an effective tumour suppressor in vivo, regulating both apical-basal polarity and cellular proliferation in a manner similar to that of DmScrib in Drosophila. These data demonstrate that hScrib is a functional homologue of DmScrib and therefore predict an important role for hScrib in the suppression of mammalian tumorigenesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003240","authors":["Lukas E Dow","Anthony M Brumby","Rosa Muratore","Michelle L Coombe","Karin A Sedelies","Joseph A Trapani","Sarah M Russell","Helena E Richardson","Patrick O Humbert","Dow LE","Brumby AM","Muratore R","Coombe ML","Sedelies KA","Trapani JA","Russell SM","Richardson HE","Humbert PO"],"doi":"10.1038\/sj.onc.1207154","endpage":"9230","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T10:02:26+00:00","issns":["0950-9232","1476-5594"],"issue":"58","journal":"Oncogene","last_mentioned_on":1197981337,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/sj.onc.1207154","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14681682"],"pmid":"14681682","pubdate":"2003-12-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"9225","subjects":["molecularbiology","neoplasms"],"title":"hScrib is a functional homologue of the Drosophila tumour suppressor Scribble.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/sj.onc.1207154","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hscrib-functional-homologue-drosophila-tumour-suppressor-scribble"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635050,"mean":4.9227315329755,"rank":816747,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2294827,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635050,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96356,"mean":8.2582561361632,"rank":25252,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69998,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96356,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3240,"mean":2.6737604198827,"rank":260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1462,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3240,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":1.9825757575758,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":58,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
