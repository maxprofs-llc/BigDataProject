The understanding of Zic molecular networks has been hampered by functional redundancy amongst family members, and because their loss-of-function phenotypes are indicative of a role in many signalling pathways. Recently molecular evidence has emerged confirming the pleiotropic nature of these proteins: they act both as classical transcription factors and as co-factors to directly and indirectly influence gene expression. It has long been known that germ-line mutation of the Zic genes in human and mouse causes a range of congenital disorders. Recently connections between Zic proteins and stem cell function have also emerged suggesting a role in adult onset diseases. The immediate challenge is to determine when and where these proteins act as transcription factors\/co-factors during development and disease and how the switch between these roles is controlled.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b26","authors":["Ali RG","Bellchambers HM","Arkell RM"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.biocel.2012.08.012","endpage":"2068","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T09:35:41+00:00","issns":["1357-2725","13572725"],"issue":"11","journal":"International Journal of Biochemistry & Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1382318544,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.biocel.2012.08.012","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22964024"],"pmid":"22964024","pubdate":"2012-09-12T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"2065","subjects":["cellbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Zinc fingers of the cerebellum (Zic): Transcription factors and co-factors.","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/zinc-fingers-cerebellum-zic-transcription-factors-cofactors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626769,"mean":4.9522514062143,"rank":817855,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2285435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626769,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94789,"mean":8.106519031945,"rank":24544,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69152,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94789,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":777,"mean":3.3388505154639,"rank":74,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":379,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":777,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":1.9149090909091,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
