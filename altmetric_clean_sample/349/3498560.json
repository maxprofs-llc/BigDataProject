We analyzed the methylation status of semaphorin 3B (SEMA3B) promoter and LOH at 3p21.3 in eight NSCLC cell lines and 27 primary tumors. Hypermethylation of SEMA3B was found in 50% of the cell lines and 41% of the primary tumors studied. The presence of hypermethylation was statistically associated with loss of SEMA3B expression in both cell lines (P = 0.02) and primary tumors (P < 0.01). There was no correlation between SEMA3B and tumor stage. On the other hand, the correlation between SEMA3B methylation status and LOH at 3p21.3 was significant (P = 0.02). Notably, 7 of 8 tumors with both hypermethylation and LOH of SEMA3B showed the absence of the expression. Treatment with 5-AZAC restored SEMA3B expression in NSCLC cell line. These results indicate that SEMA3B gene alterations may play a important role in the malignant transformation of NSCLC via a two-hit mechanism, including epigenetic changes and allelic loss, for tumor suppressor gene inactivation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dd4","authors":["Tamotsu Kuroki","Francesco Trapasso","Sai Yendamuri","Ayumi Matsuyama","Hansjuerg Alder","Noel N Williams","Larry R Kaiser","Carlo M Croce"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T09:33:43+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0008-5472"],"issue":"12","journal":"Cancer Research","last_mentioned_on":1198220846,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12810670"],"pmid":"12810670","pubdate":"2003-06-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Allelic loss on chromosome 3p21.3 and promoter hypermethylation of semaphorin 3B in non-small cell lung cancer.","type":"article","volume":"63","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/allelic-loss-chromosome-3p213-promoter-hypermethylation-semaphorin-3b-nonsmall-cell-lung-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635033,"mean":4.9228440290343,"rank":816745,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2294832,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635033,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96355,"mean":8.2582442866929,"rank":25250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69998,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96355,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4934,"mean":4.0869276302453,"rank":937,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":2592,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4934,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":2.8175068493151,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
