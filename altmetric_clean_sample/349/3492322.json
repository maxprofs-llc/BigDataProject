The full-length cDNA has an open reading frame (ORF) of 1719 bp that encodes a 572-amino-acid protein of 64 113 Da, similar to the native monomeric, cytosolic, NADP-dependent ME isolated from human liver. The comparison of the structure of this cDNA with that of the human mitochondrial NAD(P)-dependent ME (EC 1.1.1.39) shows a homology of 63%, suggesting that these two forms originated from the same gene. The expression of the cDNA in Escherichia coli as a translational fusion (glutathione S-transferase::ME) protein yielded a product of the predicted mass. The recombinant protein shows NADP-dependent malate oxidoreductase activity and is virtually inactive with NAD. It also shows other distinct features of the native cytosolic NADP-dependent ME, like Mn2+ dependence, similar substrate (Km = 117 microM) and cofactor affinity (Km = 2 microM) constants, and a lack of allosteric regulation. In human proliferative cells, the NADP-dependent ME activity is poorly expressed and barely inducible by thyroid hormones.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002932","authors":["C Gonz\u00e1lez-Manch\u00f3n","M Ferrer","M S Ayuso","R Parrilla"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T05:38:48+00:00","issns":["0378-1119"],"issue":"2","journal":"Gene","last_mentioned_on":1198133809,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7622060"],"pmid":"7622060","pubdate":"1995-07-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Cloning, sequencing and functional expression of a cDNA encoding a NADP-dependent malic enzyme from human liver.","type":"article","volume":"159","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cloning-sequencing-functional-expression-cdna-encoding-nadpdependent-malic-enzyme-human-liver-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630009,"mean":4.9312762825916,"rank":816228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2291187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630009,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95540,"mean":8.1949786997982,"rank":24856,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69593,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95540,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3488,"mean":2.3476879839403,"rank":146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":1274,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3488,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84,"mean":1.513156626506,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":72,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"ME1 (gene)","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=179138590#altmetric_citation_6","license":"public","citation_ids":[3492319,3492322],"posted_on":"2007-12-20T06:56:49+00:00","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14797200","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ProteinBoxBot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ProteinBoxBot"}}]}}
