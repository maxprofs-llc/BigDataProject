In this study, we demonstrate that the HER-2\/neu oncogene inhibits the expression of the MMP inhibitor RECK to promote cell invasion. RECK was inhibited via transcriptional repression in B104-1-1 cells, which express constitutively active HER-2\/neu. Overexpression of HER-2\/neu in NIH\/3T3 or HaCaT cells also suppressed RECK expression. Deletion and mutation assays showed that HER-2\/neu repressed RECK via the Sp1-binding site localized in the -82\/-71 region from the translational start site. DNA affinity precipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that binding of Sp1 and Sp3 to this consensus site was increased in B104-1-1 cells. We also found that HER-2\/neu inhibited RECK via the ERK signaling pathway. Sp1 proteins phosphorylated at Thr453 and Thr739 by ERK bound preferentially to the RECK promoter, and this binding was reversed by HER-2\/neu and ERK inhibitors. Furthermore, our data indicate that HER-2\/neu obviously increased HDAC1 binding to the Sp1-binding site localized in the -82\/-71 region of the RECK promoter. The histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A reversed HER-2\/neu-induced inhibition of RECK. HER-2\/neu activation was associated with increased MMP-9 secretion and activation. Re-expression of RECK in HER-2\/neu-overexpressing cells inhibited MMP-9 secretion and cell invasion. Taken together, our results suggest that HER-2\/neu induces the binding of Sp proteins and HDAC1 to the RECK promoter to inhibit RECK expression and to promote cell invasion. Restoration of RECK provides a novel strategy for the inhibition of HER-2\/neu-induced metastasis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Ming-Chuan Hsu","Hui-Chiu Chang","Wen-Chun Hung"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m510937200","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T07:38:01+00:00","issns":["1083-351X"],"journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1198205641,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1074\/jbc.M510937200","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16377629"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/281\/8\/4718.full.pdf","pmid":"16377629","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"HER-2\/neu represses the metastasis suppressor RECK via ERK and Sp transcription factors to promote cell invasion.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/her2neu-represses-metastasis-suppressor-reck-via-erk-sp-transcription-factors-promote-cell-invasion"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628714,"mean":4.9390391673343,"rank":816820,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2289004,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628714,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95291,"mean":8.1743032637214,"rank":24753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69449,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95291,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28042,"mean":2.6428469740737,"rank":1753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":9989,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28042,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243,"mean":2.4327851239669,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
