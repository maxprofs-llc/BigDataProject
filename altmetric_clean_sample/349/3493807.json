The recently described human discoidin domain receptor (DDR) has a predicted amino acid sequence 93% identical to that of murine NEP and may be its human homologue. We have mapped the gene encoding NEP in human and mouse by fluorescence in situ hybridization using a mouse cDNA probe. The NEP\/Nep gene maps to human chromosome 6p21.3 and mouse chromosome 17C, respectively. This places the NEP\/Nep gene at, or near, the major histocompatibility (MHC) locus--HLA in human and H2 in mouse, respectively. Based on its pattern of expression during development, NEP and Nep represent candidate genes for several MHC-linked developmental abnormalities in human and mouse.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002945","authors":["S Edelhoff","D A Sweetser","C M Disteche"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T06:31:46+00:00","issns":["0888-7543"],"issue":"1","journal":"Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1197934139,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7774938"],"pmid":"7774938","pubdate":"1995-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information Systems","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Mapping of the NEP receptor tyrosine kinase gene to human chromosome 6p21.3 and mouse chromosome 17C.","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mapping-nep-receptor-tyrosine-kinase-gene-human-chromosome-6p213-mouse-chromosome-17c"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4262782,"mean":5.0834221548209,"rank":993940,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2700353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4262782,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":140668,"mean":8.792367136571,"rank":43020,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":95780,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":140668,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3966,"mean":2.3956438839849,"rank":111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1019,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3966,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":2.8321176470588,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
