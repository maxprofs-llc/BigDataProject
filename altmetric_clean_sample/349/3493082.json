System members share physical associations, leucine-rich glycoprotein (LRG) structures, and a congenital deficiency state, Bernard-Soulier syndrome. With PCR techniques and platelet cDNA templates, 1.4 kb of GP V cDNA sequence was obtained that encodes 469 GP V amino acids. A genomic 3.5-kb BamHI fragment was then isolated that includes 3.46 kb of GP V cDNA sequence: the 1.7-kb open reading frame plus 2 bases of the 5' and 1.8 kb of the 3' untranslated regions. Northern blot analysis reveals three GP V platelet transcripts of 3.8, 4.2, and 5.2 kb. A 16-amino acid signal peptide is present. Mature GP V is a 544-amino acid transmembrane protein with a 504-amino acid extracellular domain that encompasses a set of 15 tandem LRG repeats in a \"flank-LRG center-flank\" array [Roth, G. J. (1991) Blood 77, 5-19] along with eight putative N-linked glycosylation sites and cleavage sites for thrombin and calpain. GP V is a transmembrane, adhesive LRG protein that plays an undefined, but potentially critical, role in the expression and\/or function of the Ib-V-IX receptor for vWf\/shear-dependent platelet adhesion in arteries.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"1993PNAS...90.8327H","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["M J Hickey","F S Hagen","M Yagi","G J Roth"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.90.18.8327","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T06:06:20+00:00","issns":["1091-6490","0027-8424"],"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1198143929,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.90.18.8327","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7690959","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC47349"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/90\/18\/8327.full.pdf","pmid":"7690959","publisher":"National Acad Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Human platelet glycoprotein V: characterization of the polypeptide and the related Ib-V-IX receptor system of adhesive, leucine-rich glycoproteins.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/human-platelet-glycoprotein-v-characterization-polypeptide-related-ibvix-receptor-system-adhesive-le"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4389782,"mean":4.849361824369,"rank":982964,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2835952,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4389782,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146906,"mean":7.8771627514381,"rank":40807,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":104245,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146906,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37022,"mean":14.234519218822,"rank":14842,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":15285,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37022,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":956,"mean":38.800862827225,"rank":581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":366,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":956,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
