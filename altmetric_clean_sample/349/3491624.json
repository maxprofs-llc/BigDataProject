Mammalian NudC interacts with Lis1, a neuronal migration protein important during neocorticogenesis, suggesting a conserved mechanism of nuclear movement in A. nidulans and neuronal migration in the developing mammalian brain (S. M. Morris et al., 1998). To further investigate this possibility, we show for the first time that NudC, Lis1, and cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain (CDIC) colocalize at the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) around the nucleus in a polarized manner facing the leading pole of cerebellar granule cells with a migratory morphology. In neurons with stationary morphology, NudC is distributed throughout the soma and colocalizes with CDIC and tubulin in neurites as well as at the MTOC. At the subcellular level, NudC, CDIC, and p150 dynactin colocalize to the interphase microtubule array and the MTOC in fibroblasts. The observed colocalization is confirmed biochemically by coimmunoprecipitation of NudC with CDIC and cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain (CDHC) from mouse brain extracts. Consistent with its expression in individual neurons, a high level of NudC is detected in regions of the embryonic neocortex undergoing extensive neurogenesis as well as neuronal migration. These data suggest a biochemical and functional interaction of NudC with Lis1 and the dynein motor complex during neuronal migration in vivo.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e79","authors":["J P Aumais","J R Tunstead","R S McNeil","B T Schaar","S K McConnell","S H Lin","G D Clark","L Y Yu-Lee"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T05:15:59+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1529-2401"],"issue":"24","journal":"Journal of Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1198027400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11734602"],"pmid":"11734602","pubdate":"2001-12-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"NudC associates with Lis1 and the dynein motor at the leading pole of neurons.","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nudc-associates-lis1-dynein-motor-leading-pole-neurons"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630293,"mean":4.9302727339889,"rank":816217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2291435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630293,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95587,"mean":8.1948401230308,"rank":24878,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69616,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95587,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9098,"mean":6.1158456634055,"rank":2572,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5498,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9098,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":382,"mean":11.451490813648,"rank":135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":244,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":382,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
