A complementary DNA was cloned that corresponds to a gene sequence induced more than 50-fold in a cultured target cell line of pheochromocytoma cells (PC12 cells) 5 hours after the addition of NGF. The induced messenger RNA encodes a 90,000-dalton polypeptide that may represent one of the primary events in NGF-induced differentiation of neurons.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"1985Sci...229..393L","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["A Levi","JD Eldridge","BM Paterson"],"doi":"10.1126\/science.3839317","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T09:27:23+00:00","issns":["1095-9203","0036-8075"],"journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":1198245327,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1126\/science.3839317","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3839317"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/content\/229\/4711\/393.full.pdf","pmid":"3839317","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Molecular cloning of a gene sequence regulated by nerve growth factor.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-cloning-gene-sequence-regulated-nerve-growth-factor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631967,"mean":4.9253635474614,"rank":816047,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2293675,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631967,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95839,"mean":8.2104542457065,"rank":25004,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69736,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95839,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27896,"mean":20.968482953934,"rank":15028,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":7318,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27896,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":533,"mean":90.306729323308,"rank":463,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":69,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":533,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
