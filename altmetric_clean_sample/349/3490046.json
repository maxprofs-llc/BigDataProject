The functional consequences of such beta(2)-subunit diversity were explored in recombinant L-type channels reconstituted in HEK 293 cells. Beta(2a) and beta(2e) targeted autonomously to the plasma membrane, whereas beta(2b)-beta(2d) localized to the cytosol when expressed in HEK 293 cells. The pattern of modulation of L-type channel voltage-dependent inactivation gating correlated with the subcellular localization of the component beta(2) variant-membrane-bound beta(2a) and beta(2e) subunits conferred slow(er) channel inactivation kinetics and displayed a smaller fraction of channels recovering from inactivation with fast kinetics, compared to beta(2b)-beta(2d) channels. The varying effects of beta(2) subunits on inactivation gating were accounted for by a quantitative model in which L-type channels reversibly distributed between fast and slow forms of voltage-dependent inactivation-membrane-bound beta(2) subunits substantially decreased the steady-state fraction of fast inactivating channels. Finally, the beta(2) variants also had distinctive effects on L-type channel steady-state activation gating, as revealed by differences in the waveforms of tail-activation (G-V) curves, and conferred differing degrees of prepulse facilitation to the channel. Our results predict important physiological consequences arising from subtle changes in Ca(2+)-channel beta(2)-subunit structure due to alternative splicing and emphasize the utility of splice variants in probing structure-function mechanisms.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2003BpJ....84.3007T","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c89","authors":["Takahashi, Shoji X","Mittman, Scott","Colecraft, Henry M"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0006-3495(03)70027-7","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T04:18:22+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0006-3495"],"issue":"5","journal":"Biophysical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1198024640,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0006-3495(03)70027-7","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12719232","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1302863"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S0006349503700277\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC1302863","pmid":"12719232","pubdate":"2003-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics"],"title":"Distinctive Modulatory Effects of Five Human Auxiliary \u03b22 Subunit Splice Variants on L-Type Calcium Channel Gating","type":"article","volume":"84","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/distinctive-modulatory-effects-five-human-auxiliary-%CE%B22-subunit-splice-variants-ltype-calcium-channel-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4729227,"mean":5.5465942099605,"rank":1107878,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":3036704,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4729227,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":162733,"mean":8.9999555834133,"rank":48405,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":112180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":162733,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2179,"mean":2.812476584022,"rank":307,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":1486,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2179,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":6.4395652173913,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":58,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
