C. 2.1.1.1) activity may be due to a genetic polymorphism. We report the characterisation of the hepatic NNMT activity in cytosol from normal human livers, enzyme protein levels determined by Western blotting and ELISA and mRNA levels determined by SDS-PAGE\/Northern blotting. Subjects with high NNMT activity had high levels of NNMT protein and NNMT mRNA levels in hepatic cytosol and the converse was true for individuals with low NNMT activity. No differences in sequences were seen when cDNAs of individuals with high and low NNMT activity were compared. Thus phenotypic differences in the general population are due to differences in steady-state mRNA levels and not because of a polymorphism in the coding region of the NNMT gene.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c38","authors":["M L Smith","D Burnett","P Bennett","R H Waring","H M Brown","A C Williams","D B Ramsden"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T08:19:11+00:00","issns":["0006-3002"],"issue":"2-3","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA)","last_mentioned_on":1198216013,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9804963"],"pmid":"9804963","pubdate":"1998-11-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"A direct correlation between nicotinamide N-methyltransferase activity and protein levels in human liver cytosol.","type":"article","volume":"1442","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/direct-correlation-between-nicotinamide-nmethyltransferase-activity-protein-levels-human-liver-cytos-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3615908,"mean":4.932414788326,"rank":815326,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2276934,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3615908,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93251,"mean":7.2057604718499,"rank":23645,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68518,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93251,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3851,"mean":2.5446566233766,"rank":254,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1366,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3851,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105,"mean":0.92336538461538,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":103,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105,"percentile":98}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
