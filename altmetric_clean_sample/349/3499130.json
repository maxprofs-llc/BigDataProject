Matrilysin-2 has been reported to be a physiological and pathological activator of pro-MMP-9. The aim of this study was to examine matrilysin-2 expression and determine whether it is correlated with progression of human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemical analysis, zymography and an in vitro invasion assay were performed. Matrilysin-2 mRNA expression was undetectable or only faintly detected in non-tumor tissues, but its overexpression was detected in 24 of the 50 ESCC tissues. Matrilysin-2 overexpression was significantly correlated with depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis and an advance in pathological tumor node metastasis (pTNM) stage. Sections with immunostaining signals in >10% of carcinoma cells at the invasive front, which were observed in 46 of 100 cases, were judged to be positive for matrilysin-2 expression. Matrilysin-2 expression was significantly correlated with depth of invasion, lymph node and distant metastasis, advance in pTNM stage and recurrence. Expression of matrilysin-2 was significantly correlated with nuclear beta-catenin expression and MMP-9 expression. Patients with matrilysin-2-positive cancer had significantly shorter overall and disease-free survival periods than did those with matrilysin-2-negative cancer. Matrilysin-2 expression retained its significant predictive value for overall and disease-free survival in multivariate analysis. Moreover, patients with concomitant expression of matrilysin-2 and MMP-9 had the worst prognosis. Zymography revealed that matrilysin-2 expression was significantly correlated with expression of active MMP-9 in ESCC tissues. Matrilysin-2-transfected TE-1 ESCC cells showed active MMP-9 activity and were more invasive in vitro compared with mock-transfected TE-1 cells. The results of this study suggest that matrilysin-2, the expression of which is closely correlated with nuclear beta-catenin expression and active MMP-9 activity, plays a key role in the progression of ESCC.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024a7","authors":["Hiroyuki Yamamoto","Akravit Vinitketkumnuen","Yasushi Adachi","Hiroaki Taniguchi","Tamaki Hirata","Nobuki Miyamoto","Katsuhiko Nosho","Arisa Imsumran","Masahiro Fujita","Masao Hosokawa","Yuji Hinoda","Kohzoh Imai"],"doi":"10.1093\/carcin\/bgh270","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T09:55:17+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1460-2180","0143-3334"],"issue":"12","journal":"Carcinogenesis","last_mentioned_on":1197983118,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/carcin\/bgh270","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15333466"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/carcin.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/25\/12\/2353.full.pdf","pmid":"15333466","pubdate":"2004-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Association of matrilysin-2 (MMP-26) expression with tumor progression and activation of MMP-9 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-matrilysin2-mmp26-expression-tumor-progression-activation-mmp9-esophageal-squamous-cell"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4013884,"mean":5.0326745274224,"rank":921180,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2535046,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4013884,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127758,"mean":9.1102824781813,"rank":38877,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":87090,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127758,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":998,"mean":4.2004052156469,"rank":165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":641,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":998,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.33,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
