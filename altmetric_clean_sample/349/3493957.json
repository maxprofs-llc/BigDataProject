It is shown that the bait domains of both alpha 2 macroglobulin and pregnancy zone protein are encoded by two exons, with conserved exon\/intron boundaries. A genetic polymorphism showing either a Met or a Val residue as the sixth amino acid of the pregnancy zone protein bait domain was detected with the rare Met allele showing a gene frequency of 0.065.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028b7","authors":["P Marynen","K Devriendt","H Van den Berghe","J J Cassiman"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T06:37:27+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0014-5793"],"issue":"2","journal":"Febs Letters","last_mentioned_on":1198147330,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1692292"],"pmid":"1692292","pubdate":"1990-03-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"A genetic polymorphism in a functional domain of human pregnancy zone protein: the bait region.
