This new protein, hPrp18, is 30% identical to the yeast splicing factor Prp18. In HeLa cell extracts immunodepleted of hPrp18, the second step of pre-mRNA splicing is abolished. Splicing activity is restored by the addition of recombinant hPrp18, demonstrating that hPrp18 is required for the second step. The hPrp18 protein is bound tightly to the spliceosome only during the second step of splicing. hPrp18 is required for the splicing of several pre-mRNAs, making it the first general second-step splicing factor found in humans. Splicing activity can be restored to hPrp18-depleted HeLa cell extracts by yeast Prp18, showing that important functional regions of the proteins have been conserved. A 90-amino-acid region near the carboxyl terminus of hPrp18 is strongly homologous to yeast Prp18 and is also conserved in rice and nematodes. The homology identifies one region important for the function of both proteins and may define a new protein motif. In contrast to yeast Prp18, hPrp18 is not stably associated with any of the snRNPs. A 55-kD protein that cross-reacts with antibodies against hPrp18 is a constituent of the U4\/U6 and U4\/U6 x U5 snRNP particles.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f61000293c","authors":["D S Horowitz","A R Krainer"],"doi":"10.1101\/gad.11.1.139","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T06:44:01+00:00","issns":["1549-5477","0890-9369"],"journal":"Genes & Development","last_mentioned_on":1198151716,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1101\/gad.11.1.139","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9000057"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/genesdev.cshlp.org\/content\/11\/1\/139.full.pdf","pmid":"9000057","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Lab","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"A human protein required for the second step of pre-mRNA splicing is functionally related to a yeast splicing factor.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/human-protein-required-second-step-premrna-splicing-functionally-related-yeast-splicing-factor-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633792,"mean":4.9212574058383,"rank":815879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295913,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633792,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96151,"mean":8.2505856266253,"rank":25136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69912,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96151,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2543,"mean":3.0113729346971,"rank":458,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":1366,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2543,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":5.0839285714286,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
