Previously, we reported on the construction of two distinct cosmid contigs and our identification of several new genes within 3p21.1. In our search for tumor suppressor genes from this region, we have cloned a gene that we have called DRR 1 (downregulated in renal cell carcinoma). The gene was first mapped to 3p21.1 by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. Further analysis of yeast artificial chromosome clones in 3p14.2-p21.1 refined its localization. DRR 1 spans about 10 Kb of genomic DNA with a 3.5-Kb mature transcript. The putative protein encoded by this gene is 144 amino acids and includes a nuclear localization signal and a coiled domain. The gene showed loss of expression in eight of eight renal cell carcinoma cell lines, one of seven ovarian cancer cell lines, one of one cervical cancer cell line, one of one gastric cancer cell line, and one of one non-small-cell lung cancer cell line. Southern blot analysis did not show any altered bands, indicating that gross structural changes or deletions did not cause the loss of expression. This gene was also found to have reduced expression in 23 of 34 paired primary renal cell carcinomas. Mutational analysis detected three polymorphic sites within the gene, but no point mutations were identified in the 34 primary tumors. However, we did detect base substitutions in 4 of 12 cell lines that had undetectable expression of the gene. We also transfected the gene into DRR 1-negative cell lines and observed clear growth retardation. Our results suggest that loss of expression of the DRR 1 gene may play an important role in the development of renal cell carcinoma and possibly other tumors.
