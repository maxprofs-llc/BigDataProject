According to the sequence data, the average sizes of the inserts and corresponding open reading frames of cDNA clones analyzed here were 4.6 kb and 1.9 kb (643 amino acid residues), respectively. From the results of homology and motif searches against the public databases, the functional categories of the 31 predicted gene products could be assigned; 25 of these predicted gene products (81%) were classified into proteins relating to cell signaling\/communication, nucleic acid management, and cell structure\/motility. The expression profiles of the genes were also studied in 10 human tissues, 8 brain regions, spinal cord, fetal brain and fetal liver by reverse transcription-coupled polymerase chain reaction, the products of which were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007156","authors":["Takahiro Nagase","Reiko Kikuno","Osamu Ohara"],"doi":"10.1093\/dnares\/8.6.319","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T06:47:35+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1756-1663","1340-2838"],"issue":"6","journal":"DNA Research","last_mentioned_on":1317357668,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/dnares\/8.6.319","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11853319"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/8\/6\/319.full.pdf","pmid":"11853319","pubdate":"2001-12-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","genetics"],"title":"Prediction of the coding sequences of unidentified human genes.
