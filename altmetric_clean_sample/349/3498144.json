The protein has been purified to near homogeneity. Based on the amino acid sequences of peptides obtained from the protein, a full-length cDNA was isolated. The cDNA encodes a protein with a single transmembrane segment and a signal sequence. The extracellular portion of the protein contains a single immunoglobulin-like domain displaying 46% sequence identity to that of myelin P0, a major structural protein of peripheral myelin. The intracellular segment of the protein shows no significant sequence identity to any known protein except for two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs. We name the protein PZR for protein zero related. Transfection of the PZR cDNA in Jurkat cells gave rise to a protein of expected molecular size. Stimulation of cells with pervanadate resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR and a near-stoichiometric association of PZR with SHP-2. Northern blotting analyses revealed that PZR is widely expressed in human tissues and is particularly abundant in heart, placenta, kidney, and pancreas. As a binding protein and a putative substrate of SHP-2, PZR protein may have an important role in cell signaling.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Z J Zhao","R Zhao"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T09:17:23+00:00","issns":["0021-9258"],"issue":"45","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1198222787,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9792637"],"pmid":"9792637","pubdate":"1998-11-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Purification and cloning of PZR, a binding protein and putative physiological substrate of tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2.","type":"article","volume":"273","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/purification-cloning-pzr-binding-protein-putative-physiological-substrate-tyrosine-phosphatase-shp2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627970,"mean":4.9447382433571,"rank":817344,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2287441,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627970,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95110,"mean":8.1481641905604,"rank":24684,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69338,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95110,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28042,"mean":2.6449878392354,"rank":1753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":9977,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28042,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243,"mean":2.4327851239669,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
