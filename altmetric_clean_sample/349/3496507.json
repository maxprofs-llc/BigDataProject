We show that EH domains from Eps15 and Eps15R bind in vitro to peptides containing an asparagine-proline-phenylalanine (NPF) motif. Direct screening of expression libraries with EH domains yielded a number of putative EH interactors, all of which possessed NPF motifs that were shown to be responsible for the interaction. Among these interactors were the human homolog of NUMB, a developmentally reguated gene of Drosophila, and RAB, the cellular cofactor of the HIV REV protein. We demonstrated coimmunoprecipitation of Eps15 with NUMB and RAB. Finally, in vitro binding of NPF-containing peptides to cellular proteins and EST database screening established the existence of a family of EH-containing proteins in mammals. Based on the characteristics of EH-containing and EH-binding proteins, we propose that EH domains are involved in processes connected with the transport and sorting of molecules within the cell.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f61000293c","authors":["Anna Elisabetta Salcini","Stefano Confalonieri","Margherita Doria","Elisa Santolini","Elena Tassi","Olga Minenkova","Gianni Cesareni","Pier Giuseppe Pelicci","Pier Paolo Di Fiore"],"doi":"10.1101\/gad.11.17.2239","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T08:22:30+00:00","issns":["1549-5477","0890-9369"],"issue":"17","journal":"Genes & Development","last_mentioned_on":1200456502,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1101\/gad.11.17.2239","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9303539","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC275390"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/genesdev.cshlp.org\/content\/11\/17\/2239.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC275390","pmid":"9303539","pubdate":"2015-05-22T22:51:24+00:00","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Lab","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Binding specificity and in vivo targets of the EH domain, a novel protein\u2013protein interaction\u2009module","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/binding-specificity-vivo-targets-eh-domain-novel-proteinprotein-interaction-module"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3989887,"mean":5.0352317582571,"rank":917414,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2528386,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3989887,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126974,"mean":9.1216470819881,"rank":38600,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":86655,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126974,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2638,"mean":3.0342503793627,"rank":487,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":1471,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2638,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":5.6939393939394,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Ph.
