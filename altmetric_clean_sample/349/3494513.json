Here, we report the subcellular distribution and function of Rab14. By immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, both endogenous as well as overexpressed Rab14 were localized to biosynthetic (rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, and trans-Golgi network) and endosomal compartments (early endosomal vacuoles and associated vesicles). Notably overexpression of Rab14Q70L shifted the distribution toward the early endosome associated vesicles, whereas the S25N and N124I mutants induced a shift toward the Golgi region. A similar, although less pronounced, redistribution of the transferrin receptor was also observed in cells overexpressing Rab14 mutants. Impairment of Rab14 function did not however affect transferrin uptake or recycling kinetics. Together, these findings suggest that Rab14 is involved in the biosynthetic\/recycling pathway between the Golgi and endosomal compartments.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c7","authors":["Jagath R.
