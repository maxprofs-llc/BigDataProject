Our findings do not indicate any association between the PAI-1 or t-PA polymorphisms and risk of stroke. Adding our PAI-1 results to previous studies in a meta-analysis indicated a strong association between this polymorphism and ischemic stroke (P = .0002), with no publication bias but with extreme heterogeneity. There was evidence of stroke association with the PAI-1 4G\/5G locus. Strong heterogeneity indicates the need to address other issues, including association with particular stroke subtypes or linkage disequilibrium (LD) with another causative allele. The results also sound a cautionary note that varying LD structure across populations may obscure the relationship with a causative locus, and that future meta-analyses need to look beyond a simple pooled estimate.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005ab3","doi":"10.1016\/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2007.03.002","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T08:37:09+00:00","issns":["1052-3057"],"journal":"Journal of Stroke & Cerebrovascular Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1198149805,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2007.03.002","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17689414"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.strokejournal.org\/article\/S1052305707000390\/pdf","pmid":"17689414","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["brain"],"title":"The PAI-1 4G\/5G gene polymorphism and ischemic stroke: an association study and meta-analysis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pai1-4g5g-gene-polymorphism-ischemic-stroke-association-study-metaanalysis-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628302,"mean":4.942517914036,"rank":817178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288053,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628302,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95187,"mean":8.1661488454186,"rank":24720,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69382,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95187,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259,"mean":1.7285503875969,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":224,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":8.7126666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Alpha-tocopherol transfer protein","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=179163362#altmetric_citation_19","license":"public","citation_ids":[3496902],"posted_on":"2007-12-20T11:23:25+00:00","summary":"Alpha-tocopherol transfer protein is a protein that in humans is encoded by the TTPA gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14799862","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ProteinBoxBot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ProteinBoxBot"}}]}}
