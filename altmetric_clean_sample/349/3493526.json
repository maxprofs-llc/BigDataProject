It has structural homology to calponin, but how SM22 binds to actin remains unknown. We performed site-directed mutagenesis to generate a series of NH(2)-terminal histidine (His)-tagged mutants of human SM22 in Escherichia coli and used these to analyze the functional importance of potential actin binding domains. Purified full-length recombinant SM22 bound to actin in vitro, as demonstrated by cosedimentation assay. Binding did not vary with calcium concentration. The COOH-terminal domain of SM22 is required for actin affinity, because COOH terminally truncated mutants [SM22-(1-186) and SM22-(1-166)] exhibited markedly reduced cosedimentation with actin, and no actin binding of SM22-(1-151) could be detected. Internal deletion of a putative actin binding site (154-KKAQEHKR-161) partially prevented actin binding, as did point mutation to neutralize either or both pairs of positively charged residues at the ends of this region (KK154LL and\/or KR160LL). Internal deletion of amino acids 170-180 or 170-186 also partially or almost completely inhibited actin cosedimentation, respectively. Of the three consensus protein kinase C or casein kinase II phosphorylation sites in SM22, only Ser-181 was readily phosphorylated by protein kinase C in vitro, and such phosphorylation greatly decreased actin binding. Substitution of Ser-181 to aspartic acid (to mimic serine phosphorylation) also reduced actin binding. Immunostains of transiently transfected airway myocytes revealed that full-length NH(2)-terminal FLAG-tagged SM22 colocalizes with actin filaments, whereas FLAG-SM22-(1-151) does not. These data confirm that SM22 binds to actin in vitro and in vivo and, for the first time, demonstrate that multiple regions within the COOH-terminal domain are required for full actin affinity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b71","authors":["Y Fu","H W Liu","S M Forsythe","P Kogut","J F McConville","A J Halayko","B Camoretti-Mercado","J Solway"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T06:21:54+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["8750-7587"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Applied Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1198126876,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11053353"],"pmid":"11053353","pubdate":"2000-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Mutagenesis analysis of human SM22: characterization of actin binding.","type":"article","volume":"89","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mutagenesis-analysis-human-sm22-characterization-actin-binding"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628675,"mean":4.9393923648184,"rank":816892,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288838,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628675,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95274,"mean":8.1736700429294,"rank":24752,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69434,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95274,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2259,"mean":7.0902240921169,"rank":752,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":1218,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2259,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":10.445833333333,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
