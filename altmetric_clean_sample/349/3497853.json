We have tested the hypothesis that progressive cell clustering controls the proteolytic cascade for activation of gelatinase A\/matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), which involves formation of an intermediate ternary complex of membrane type 1 MMP (MT1-MMP\/MMP-14), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2), and pro-MMP-2 at the cell surface. Surprisingly, truncation of ALCAM severely impaired MMP-2 activation in a nude mouse xenograft model, in which we previously observed diminished primary tumor growth and enhanced melanoma metastasis. Comparative studies of two-dimensional monolayer and three-dimensional collagen-gel cultures revealed that extensive cell-to-cell contacts, wild-type ALCAM, and cell-to-matrix interactions were all indispensable for efficient conversion of pro-MMP-2 to its active form in metastatic melanoma cells. Truncated, dominant-negative ALCAM diminished MMP-2 activation via reduced transcript levels and decreased processing of MT1-MMP. Failure of the proteolytic cascade after selective ALCAM depletion by RNA interference was mainly due to incomplete MT1-MMP processing, which was otherwise promoted by extensive cell-to-cell contacts. These data attribute a novel signaling role to ALCAM in regulation of proteolysis and support its previously postulated sensor function in invasive growth.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dd4","authors":["Pim C.
