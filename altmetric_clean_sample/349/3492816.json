Here, the crystal structure of Nc-rck\/p54, the N-terminal core domain of rck\/p54, revealed that the P-loop in motif I formed a closed conformation, which was induced by Asn131, a residue unique to the RCK subfamily. It appears that ATP does not bind to the P-loop. The results of dynamic light scattering revealed to ATP-induced conformational change of rck\/p54. It was demonstrated that free rck\/p54 is a distended molecule in solution, and that the approach between N-terminal core and C-terminal domains for ATP binding would be essential when unwinding RNA. The results from helicase assay using electron micrograph, ATP hydrolytic and luciferase assay showed that c-myc IRES RNA, whose secondary structure regulates IRES-dependant translation, was unwound by rck\/p54 and indicated that it is a good substrate for rck\/p54. Over-expression of rck\/p54 in HeLa cells caused growth inhibition and cell cycle arrest at G2\/M with down-regulation of c-myc expression. These findings altogether suggest that rck\/p54 may affect the IRES-dependent translation of c-myc even in the cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f61000293e","authors":["Matsui, Tsutomu","Hogetsu, Keita","Usukura, Jiro","Sato, Takao","Kumasaka, Takashi","Akao, Yukihiro","Tanaka, Nobuo"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1365-2443.2006.00951.x","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T05:56:43+00:00","issns":["1365-2443"],"journal":"Genes to Cells","last_mentioned_on":1198142028,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1365-2443.2006.00951.x","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16611246"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1365-2443.2006.00951.x\/pdf","pmid":"16611246","pubdate":"2006-03-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"Structural insight of human DEAD-box protein rck\/p54 into its substrate recognition with conformational changes.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structural-insight-human-deadbox-protein-rckp54-substrate-recognition-conformational-changes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630565,"mean":4.929464153233,"rank":816175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2291818,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630565,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95649,"mean":8.2005515640685,"rank":24907,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69647,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95649,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":455,"mean":2.7194185022026,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":230,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":455,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":2.0272727272727,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
