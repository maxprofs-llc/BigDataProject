We investigated the impact of mirtazapine on the activity of a key neurosteroidogenic enzyme, the 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3alpha-HSD), and on the levels of neuroactive steroids in relation to clinical response. A total of 23 drug-free in-patients suffering from a major depressive episode (DSM-IV criteria) underwent 5-week treatment with mirtazapine (45 mg\/day). Plasma samples were taken weekly at 0800 and quantified for neuroactive steroids by means of combined gas chromatography\/mass spectrometry analysis. Enzyme activity was determined by assessment of steroid conversion rates. Irrespective of clinical outcome, there were significant increases in 3alpha,5alpha-tetrahydroprogesterone, 3alpha,5beta-tetrahydroprogesterone, 5alpha-dihydroprogesterone, and 5beta-dihydroprogesterone after mirtazapine treatment, whereas 3beta,5alpha-tetrahydroprogesterone levels were significantly decreased. In vitro investigations demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibitory effect of mirtazapine on the activity of the microsomal 3alpha-HSD in the oxidative direction (conversion of 3alpha,5alpha-tetrahydroprogesterone to 5alpha-dihydroprogesterone). Mirtazapine affects neuroactive steroid composition similarly as do SSRIs. The inhibition of the oxidative pathway catalyzed by the microsomal 3alpha-HSD is compatible with an enhanced formation of 3alpha-reduced neuroactive steroids. However, the changes in neuroactive steroid concentrations more likely reflect direct pharmacological effects of this antidepressant rather than clinical improvement in general.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5083cf058f61000311c","authors":["C Sch\u00fcle","C Sch\u00fcle","E Romeo","D P Uzunov","D Eser","F di Michele","T C Baghai","A Pasini","M Schwarz","H Kempter","R Rupprecht"],"doi":"10.1038\/sj.mp.4001782","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T06:55:49+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Molecular Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1439417265,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/sj.mp.4001782","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16344854"],"pmid":"16344854","pubdate":"2005-12-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Influence of mirtazapine on plasma concentrations of neuroactive steroids in major depression and on 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-mirtazapine-plasma-concentrations-neuroactive-steroids-major-depression-3%CE%B1hydroxysteroid-d"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5476876,"mean":6.3619433143891,"rank":1385760,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3466762,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5476876,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193675,"mean":8.7996800809609,"rank":58415,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":132482,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193675,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1528,"mean":21.476091683039,"rank":861,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":500,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1528,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":43.9536,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Psychology":2}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"3-alpha-HSD","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=179168607#altmetric_citation_17","license":"public","citation_ids":[3494433],"posted_on":"2007-12-20T12:19:22+00:00","summary":"3\u03b1-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3\u03b1-HSD), also known as aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C4, is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the AKR1C4 gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14800502","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ProteinBoxBot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ProteinBoxBot"}},{"title":"Antineurosteroid","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=675821339#altmetric_citation_b89ecd0b-3c06-44ea-b88b-a66d69fee1a8","license":"public","citation_ids":[3494433],"posted_on":"2015-08-12T22:07:45+00:00","summary":"An antineurosteroid, or more precisely, a neurosteroid biosynthesis inhibitor, is an drug that inhibits the endogenous production of neurosteroids.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=47510379","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Medgirl131","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Medgirl131"}}]}}
