Structures of human heterodimeric Sae1\/Sae2-Mg.ATP and Sae1\/Sae2-SUMO-1-Mg.ATP complexes were determined at 2.2 and 2.75 A resolution, respectively. Despite the presence of Mg.ATP, the Sae1\/Sae2-SUMO-1-Mg.ATP structure reveals a substrate complex insomuch as the SUMO C-terminus remains unmodified within the adenylation site and 35 A from the catalytic cysteine, suggesting that additional changes within the adenylation site may be required to facilitate chemistry prior to adenylation and thioester transfer. A mechanism for E2 recruitment to E1 is suggested by biochemical and genetic data, each of which supports a direct role for the E1 C-terminal ubiquitin-like domain for E2 recruitment during conjugation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027b6","authors":["Luisa Maria Lois","Christopher D Lima"],"doi":"10.1038\/sj.emboj.7600552","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T06:16:48+00:00","issns":["1460-2075"],"journal":"EMBO Journal","last_mentioned_on":1468887969,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/sj.emboj.7600552","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15660128","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC548657"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/emboj.embopress.org\/content\/embojnl\/24\/3\/439.full.pdf","pmid":"15660128","publisher":"EMBO Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"Structures of the SUMO E1 provide mechanistic insights into SUMO activation and E2 recruitment to E1","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structures-sumo-e1-provide-mechanistic-insights-sumo-activation-e2-recruitment-e1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8088896,"mean":6.8703833603893,"rank":2035534,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4946242,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8088896,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242501,"mean":8.3487382103092,"rank":69904,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":167047,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242501,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4453,"mean":5.2675116801438,"rank":1154,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1591,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4453,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":15.757868852459,"rank":57,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":8}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":31,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
