Case 1 was a 37-year-old male with a left middle fossa tumor; case 2 was a 68-year-old female with a cerebellar tumor. They showed late metastasis to the lung or bone 8 or 13\u00a0years, respectively, after the first surgery. Histology of both primary and metastatic tumors showed a cellular hemangiopericytomatous pattern with nuclear atypia. The primary tumors showed nuclear staining of STAT6, but both metastatic tumors showed nuclear and cytoplasmic STAT6. DNA sequencing revealed two kinds of NAB2-STAT6 fusion genes. One consisted of exon 6 of NAB2, intron 6 of NAB2, and the middle of exon 17 of STAT6 (observed in the primary and metastatic tumors of case 1); the other consisted of exon 6 of NAB2 and the beginning of exon 17 of STAT6 (observed in the metastatic tumor of case 2). The primary tumor of case 2 had both fusion genes. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report NAB2-STAT6 fusion gene analysis in primary and metastatic meningeal SFT\/HPCs and a case showed different fusion gene status in the metastatic tumor.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60f3cf058f610006ce9","authors":["Nakada, Satoko","Minato, Hiroshi","Takegami, Tsutomu","Kurose, Nozomu","Ikeda, Hiroko","Kobayashi, Masako","Sasagawa, Yasuo","Akai, Takuya","Kato, Takashi","Yamamoto, Norio","Nojima, Takayuki"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10014-015-0220-x","endpage":"274","first_seen_on":"2016-06-10T11:48:03+00:00","issns":["1861-387X","1433-7398"],"issue":"4","journal":"Brain Tumor Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1465554635,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25893823?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25893823","pubdate":"2015-04-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pathology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"268","subjects":["neoplasms","pathology","brain"],"title":"NAB2\u2013STAT6 fusion gene analysis in two cases of meningeal solitary fibrous tumor\/hemangiopericytoma with late distant metastases","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nab2stat6-fusion-gene-analysis-two-cases-meningeal-solitary-fibrous-tumorhemangiopericytoma-late-dis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7879571,"mean":6.6725285125901,"rank":6823261,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7879571,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268521,"mean":11.398721838224,"rank":223783,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268521,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96,"mean":0.70210526315789,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.02,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"PT":1},"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/braintumor_UL\/statuses\/741215980504776704","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8635722],"posted_on":"2016-06-10T10:30:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Brain tumor ULisboa","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/687579003163643904\/d5iTojK9_normal.jpg","description":"Follow for the latest updates on Brain tumors.
