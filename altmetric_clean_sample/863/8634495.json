When combating viral infections, T lymphocytes are an indispensable part of human acquired immunity. However, studies on the use of natural products in stimulating lymphocyte-mediated interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) production are very limited. In this study, we found that acteoside, a natural phenylpropanoid glycoside from Kuding Tea, enhanced IFN-\u03b3 production in mouse lymphocytes in a dose-dependent manner, particularly in the CD4+ and CD8+ subsets of T lymphocytes. To this end, we suggest that the antiviral activity of acteoside was highly correlated to its inducing ability of IFN-\u03b3 production. Mechanistically, the activation of T-bet enhanced the promoter of IFN-\u03b3 and subsequently resulted in an increased IFN-\u03b3 production in T cells. Collectively, we have found a natural product with the capacity to selectively enhance mouse T cell IFN-\u03b3 production. Given the role of IFN-\u03b3 in the immune system, further studies to clarify the role of acteoside in inducing IFN-\u03b3 and prevention of viral infection are needed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6183cf058f610007461","authors":["Xun Song","Jiang He","Hong Xu","Xiaopeng Hu","Xuli Wu","Haiqiang Wu","Lizhong Liu","Chenghui Liao","Yong Zeng","Yan Li","Yue Hao","Chenshu Xu","Long Fan","Jiang Zhang","HONGJIE ZHANG","Zhendan He","Xiao-Peng Hu","Xu-Li Wu","Hai-Qiang Wu","Li-Zhong Liu","Cheng-Hui Liao","Chen-Shu Xu","Jian Zhang","Hong-Jie Zhang","Zhen-Dan He"],"doi":"10.1039\/c6fo00335d","endpage":"3030","first_seen_on":"2016-06-10T10:58:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2042-650X"],"issue":"7","journal":"Food & Function","last_mentioned_on":1465552765,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2016\/FO\/C6FO00335D?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:%20rss\/FO%20(RSC%20-%20Food%20%26%20Function%20latest%20articles%20)"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2016\/fo\/c6fo00335d","pmid":"27326537","pubdate":"2016-06-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"3017","subjects":["physiology","chemistry","nutritionalsciences","biochemistry"],"title":"The Antiviral Effects of Acteoside and the Underlying IFN-\u03b3-Inducing Action","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antiviral-effects-acteoside-underlying-ifn%CE%B3inducing-action"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7879571,"mean":6.6725285125901,"rank":5975763,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1056322,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7879571,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268520,"mean":11.398791660925,"rank":187709,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":44733,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268520,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1349,"mean":3.685940652819,"rank":764,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1349,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116,"mean":7.6632173913043,"rank":70,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1,"Environmental Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cheminfochem\/statuses\/741208137307394048","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8634495],"posted_on":"2016-06-10T09:59:25+00:00","author":{"name":"cheminfochem","url":"http:\/\/www.infochem.co.uk\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/595534993138429952\/ULVzIDHv_normal.jpg","description":"We want people to understand the technicalities behind the beauty of physics, the mystery of chemistry and the loveliness of science as a whole.","id_on_source":"cheminfochem","tweeter_id":"3235595698","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":6},"tweet_id":"741208137307394048"}]}}
