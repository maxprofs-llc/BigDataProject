Factors which influenced CAM usage were; the patients' educational level, amount of income per month, the duration of the individuals' breast cancer diagnoses, menopausal status, the type of axillary surgery used in the course of their treatment, the incidences of systemic recurrence and physical components as measured by the SF-36.\nThe results have shown that most Thai breast cancer patients used CAM for the treatment of their breast cancer and had used CAM after being diagnosed with breast cancer Healthcare providers should recognize and provide pros and cons to patients and their family if CAM were used during breast cancer treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9263cf058f61000dcfc","authors":["Songtish, Dolrudee","Akranurakkul, Prinya","Chaiaroon, Wanna"],"first_seen_on":"2016-06-10T11:30:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0125-2208"],"journal":"Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand Chotmaihet thangphaet","last_mentioned_on":1465554250,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27276826?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27276826","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"The Prevalence and Related Factors of Complementary and Alternative Medicine Used in Thai Breast Cancer Patients.","type":"article","volume":"98 Suppl 10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-related-factors-complementary-alternative-medicine-used-thai-breast-cancer-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7879571,"mean":6.6725285125901,"rank":6823263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7879571,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268521,"mean":11.39872965887,"rank":223783,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268521,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":492,"mean":2.2700081466395,"rank":329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":492,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":0.50769230769231,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/741212971683053568","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8635110],"posted_on":"2016-06-10T10:18:38+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":722},"tweet_id":"741212971683053568"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/741214365353795584","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8635110],"posted_on":"2016-06-10T10:24:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":722},"tweet_id":"741214365353795584"}]}}
