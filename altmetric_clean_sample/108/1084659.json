It is particularly interesting for forest mitigation projects which are either ineligible in compliance markets or confronted with a plethora of technical and financial hurdles and lacking market demand. As the OTC market is not regulated, voluntary standards have been created to secure the social and environmental integrity of the traded mitigation projects and thus to ensure the quality of the resulting carbon credits. Building on a theoretical efficiency-legitimacy framework, this study aims to identify and analyse the characteristics and indicators that determine the efficiency and organisational legitimacy of standards for afforestation\/reforestation carbon projects.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007ed","authors":["Eduard Merger","Till Pistorius"],"doi":"10.1186\/1750-0680-6-4","first_seen_on":"2012-11-22T19:05:56+00:00","issns":["","1750-0680"],"issue":"1","journal":"Carbon Balance and Management","last_mentioned_on":1319023440,"links":["http:\/\/www.cbmjournal.com\/content\/6\/1\/4"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cbmjournal.com\/content\/pdf\/1750-0680-6-4.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3169451","pmid":"21849036","pubdate":"2011-08-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ecosystems","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Management","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Forestry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Earth and Planetary Sciences","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"4","title":"Effectiveness and legitimacy of forest carbon standards in the OTC voluntary carbon market","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effectiveness-legitimacy-forest-carbon-standards-otc-voluntary-carbon-market"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629910,"mean":4.9315517540573,"rank":603392,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":3013295,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629910,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275090,"mean":5.653886334968,"rank":51675,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":222713,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275090,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":5.6200357142857,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":3.165,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
