Nerve conduction studies of the left arm revealed normal motor and sensory responses. Needle examination revealed acute denervation changes in all myotomes of the affected extremity, including cervical paraspinals on the left, and several myotomes on the contralateral side. The laboratory evaluation revealed normal anti-GM1 antibodies and 3 IgM\/5 IgG bands on Lyme Western Blot. The patient began treatment with 28 days of intravenous ceftriaxone. On follow-up, patient had regained full strength of her extremities with no sensory deficits. Inflammatory borrelia radiculitis usually presents with pain in the distribution of the affected nerves and nerve roots. The novelty of this case report rests on (1) the absence of primary borreliosis symptomatology preceding the radiculitis and (2) the painless and bilateral clinical presentation in a patient with suspected Lyme radiculitis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007beb","doi":"10.1097\/cnd.0b013e318279d634","first_seen_on":"2012-11-24T08:04:55+00:00","issns":["1537-1611"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Clinical Neuromuscular Disease","last_mentioned_on":1359961365,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23172387?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23172387","pubdate":"2012-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["physiology","neurology"],"title":"Acute Bilateral Painless Radiculitis With Abnormal Borrelia burgdorferi Immunoblot.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/acute-bilateral-painless-radiculitis-abnormal-borrelia-burgdorferi-immunoblot"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":924443,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":3566687,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279659,"mean":5.8699013437843,"rank":67081,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":211437,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279659,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108,"mean":1.5523738317757,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.2857142857143,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Business, Management and Accounting":1,"Philosophy":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"NL":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Acute Bilateral Painless Radiculitis ...
