Detection of infection markers for these agents is a major challenge for testing laboratories in a resource poor setting. As blood transfusion is an important activity saving millions of live every year, it also carries a risk of transfusion transmissible infections caused by these fatal blood borne pathogens if the quality of testing is compromised. Conventional ELISA is regarded as the mostly used screening technique but due to limitations like high cost, unavailability in many blood banks and testing sites, involvement of costly instruments, time taking nature and requirement of highly skilled personnel for interpretation, rapid tests are gaining more importance and warrants comparison of performance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008a9","doi":"10.1186\/1743-422x-9-290","first_seen_on":"2012-11-26T10:41:03+00:00","issns":["1743-422X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Virology Journal","last_mentioned_on":1355577648,"links":["http:\/\/www.virologyj.com\/content\/9\/1\/290\/abstract"],"pmid":"23181517","pubdate":"2012-11-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"290","title":"Performance and diagnostic usefulness of commercially available enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and rapid kits for detection of HIV, HBV and HCV in India","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/performance-diagnostic-usefulness-commercially-available-enzyme-linked-immunosorbent-assay-rapid-kit"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":1929273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2536851,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279864,"mean":5.863757417022,"rank":107997,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":167958,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279864,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1270,"mean":3.1127171000788,"rank":517,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":708,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1270,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97,"mean":2.3534375,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":55,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
