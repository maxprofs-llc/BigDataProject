Immunohistochemistry studies in MH are lacking. The aim of this study is to investigate the immunoprofile of MH and gain further insight in its histogenesis. We evaluated 9 cases of MH. Immunohistochemical expression of WT1, GLUT-1, and D2-40 was performed in all cases. All 9 MHs resulted completely positive for WT1 immunostaining. Immunohistochemistry performed in all 9 MH cases showed negative staining for GLUT-1 and D2-40. We added further support to the importance of WT1 as a useful tool in the diagnosis of vascular neoplasms. D2-40 negativity in all tested lesions implied that MH does not exhibit a lymphatic differentiation. GLUT-1, which is characteristically positive in infantile hemangioma and verrucous hemangioma, showed to be negative in MHs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6083cf058f610006970","doi":"10.1097\/dad.0b013e31824d2c27","first_seen_on":"2012-11-26T12:06:27+00:00","issns":["0193-1091"],"issue":"8","journal":"The American Journal of Dermatopathology","last_mentioned_on":1353932157,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/amjdermatopathology\/Abstract\/2012\/12000\/Microvenular_Hemangioma_An_Immunohistochemical.3.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/amjdermatopathology\/2012\/12000\/Microvenular_Hemangioma_An_Immunohistochemical.3.pdf","pmid":"23169416","pubdate":"2012-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"810","subjects":["pathology","dermatology"],"title":"Microvenular Hemangioma\u2014An Immunohistochemical Study of 9 Cases","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microvenular-hemangiomaan-immunohistochemical-study-9-cases-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":1970525,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":2518033,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279866,"mean":5.8700154717452,"rank":111420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":166658,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279866,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":542,"mean":1.1776414048059,"rank":109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":426,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":542,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.2052631578947,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"MX":1,"VE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MSLDermatopato\/statuses\/273034959046967296","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1089368],"posted_on":"2012-11-26T12:06:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Marcela Saeb Lima","url":"http:\/\/www.msldermatopato.com.mx\/index.html","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/842687287531991040\/sg-b-gU-_normal.jpg","description":"Dermatopathologist and dermatologist, researcher, academic professor","id_on_source":"MSLDermatopato","tweeter_id":"117424644","geo":{"lt":23,"ln":-102,"country":"MX"},"followers":2538},"tweet_id":"273034959046967296"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ftapia\/statuses\/273037376123719680","license":"public","rt":["msldermatopato"],"citation_ids":[1089368],"posted_on":"2012-11-26T12:15:57+00:00","author":{"name":"Felix J.
