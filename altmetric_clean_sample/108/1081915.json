The model was based on SSHC's established Xpress clinic. A needs assessment among NUAA clients was undertaken prior to commencement in order to ascertain potential uptake. A computer-assisted self interview was developed with data securely transferred to SSHC daily. During the 6 months from January to July 2011, almost 3000 occasions of service were recorded in the NSP from an estimated 375 clients. Four clients took advantage of NUAA Xpress during this time. Despite initial client interest, promotional efforts and the success of this methodology elsewhere, this outreach model did not have a successful uptake and was discontinued. This project provides value in considering the methodology and implementation of future outreach STI testing projects for people who inject drugs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f61000891a","authors":["Martin L","Crawford S","Knight V","Bath N","McNulty A"],"doi":"10.1071\/sh12078","first_seen_on":"2012-11-21T20:11:12+00:00","issns":["1448-5028","1449-8987"],"issue":"2","journal":"Sexual Health","last_mentioned_on":1382477208,"links":["http:\/\/www.publish.csiro.au\/paper\/SH12078","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23158773"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.publish.csiro.au\/?act=view_file\r\n\t\t<\/script>\r\n\r\n\t\t<script src=","pmid":"23158773","pubdate":"2012-11-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"CSIRO PUBLISHING","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Studies In Human Society","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"183","subjects":["sexuallytransmitteddiseases"],"title":" Poor uptake of community based sexually transmissible infection testing at an inner city needle and syringe program","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/poor-uptake-community-based-sexually-transmissible-infection-testing-inner-city-needle-syringe-progr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5568474,"mean":6.3872828109264,"rank":2114124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":3434973,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5568474,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285680,"mean":6.2415994035265,"rank":86969,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":197230,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285680,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":399,"mean":5.5067788944724,"rank":131,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":268,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":399,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":6.8204545454545,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
