It is associated with prenatal androgen exposure, and studies have evaluated the ratio as a marker for certain traits and disease states known to be associated with higher levels of in utero androgens, such as prostate cancer. There are currently no screening tools that stratify men with prostate cancer according to the severity of their disease. This study aims to investigate the 2D:4D ratio as a potential marker for prostate cancer severity. Our hypothesis was that lower digit ratios, representing higher in utero androgen exposure, would be associated with more severe disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033c5","authors":["M Waters","C M Rebholz","B Wood","A Kuske","M McIntyre","O Sartor"],"doi":"10.1038\/pcan.2012.46","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2012-11-22T20:29:31+00:00","issns":["1365-7852","1476-5608"],"journal":"Prostate Cancer & Prostatic Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1353615613,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/pcan\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/pcan201246a.html"],"pmid":"23146972","pubdate":"2012-11-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Second to fourth digit ratio and prostate cancer severity","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/second-fourth-digit-ratio-prostate-cancer-severity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":4202804,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283045,"mean":6.1073362092112,"rank":234048,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283045,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":273,"mean":5.9631470588235,"rank":266,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":273,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.5,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
