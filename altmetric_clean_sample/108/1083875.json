Carcinogenesis of ELF-EMF may be mediated by effect on the immune system. During an immune response, na\u00efve T cells differentiate to effector type 1 helper T cells (T(H)1), T(H)2, or T(H)17 subsets according to existence of different cytokines and T(H)1 is important in defense against tumors. Therefore, it will be reasonable to test whether ELF-EMF can change cytokines like interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3), interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-6, and IL-12 that regulate T(H)1\/T(H)2\/T(H)17 balance. Forty adult male rats were randomly separated into ELF-EMF-exposed and sham-exposed control groups. The ELF-EMF group was exposed to a flux density of 100\u00a0\u03bcT, frequency 50\u00a0Hz, 2\u00a0h\/day for 3 months. The controls were placed in identical chamber without ELF-EMF. The results showed there were no significant differences between the mean mass of rats, thymuses, and spleens in ELF-EMF exposed group compared with controls. Serum IL-12 level was decreased from 418\u00a0\u00b1\u00a047\u00a0pg\/ml in controls to 300\u00a0\u00b1\u00a023\u00a0pg\/ml (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in ELF-EMF-exposed group. Phytohemagglutinin activated of in vitro production of IL-6 by the whole spleen culture (1356\u00a0\u00b1\u00a092\u00a0pg\/ml) and total blood culture (418\u00a0\u00b1\u00a040\u00a0pg\/ml) of ELF-EMF-exposed rats were higher (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) comparing with controls (905\u00a0\u00b1\u00a074\u00a0pg\/ml), (182\u00a0\u00b1\u00a026\u00a0pg\/ml), respectively. However, the levels of IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, and IL-6 of serum and IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, and IL-12 in spleen culture and total blood culture of two groups were not significantly different. It seems that ELF-EMF may change T(H)1\/T(H)2\/T(H)17 balance toward down regulation of T(H)1 and upregulation T(H)17 type responses.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5233cf058f610003bf0","authors":["Salehi I","Sani KG","Zamani A","Iraj Salehi","Karim Ghazikhanlou Sani","Alireza Zamani"],"doi":"10.3109\/15368378.2012.692343","first_seen_on":"2012-11-22T17:12:53+00:00","issns":["1536-8378","1536-8386"],"issue":"1","journal":"Electromagnetic Biology & Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1487693228,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23046051?dopt=Abstract&buffer_share=1e2d7","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23046051","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/23046051\/"],"pmid":"23046051","pubdate":"2012-10-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology","physiology"],"title":"Exposure of rats to extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMF) alters cytokines production.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.3109\/15368378.2012.692343","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exposure-rats-extremely-lowfrequency-electromagnetic-fields-elfemf-alters-cytokines-production"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8250529,"mean":6.9707556030289,"rank":5966091,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1990559,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8250529,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":293020,"mean":6.7860684597244,"rank":185068,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":94200,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":293020,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":215,"mean":8.4055046728972,"rank":137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":68,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":215,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.66666666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
