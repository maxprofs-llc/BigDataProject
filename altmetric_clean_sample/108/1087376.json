Although insulin administration restores lactation, the manner by which it does so is unknown. The goals of this study were to determine which phase of lactation, milk synthesis\/supply (MS), and\/or milk release (MR) was affected. Inasmuch as insulin, corticosterone, and prolactin, among other hormones, are involved in milk synthesis in vitro, this study investigated their probable roles in the suppression of lactation in diabetes in vivo. Diabetes was induced in rats on Day 3 postpartum with streptozotocin (50-60 mg\/kg, ip). Milk synthesis\/supply and milk release were indirectly monitored using body weight gain of pups during a timed-feeding period on postnatal Days 8\/9 and 13\/14. Plasma corticosterone, insulin, C-peptide, and prolactin were measured by radioimmunoassay in control, diabetic, and insulin-replaced diabetic animals. Insulin replacement was provided by means of an osmotic minipump implanted subcutaneously in the nape of the neck. In addition, several parameters of maternal behavior were monitored in order to determine whether diabetes affected maternal behavior and, therefore, whether such changes played a role in the alterations of lactation observed during diabetes. Diabetes significantly suppressed MS and MR. However, the decrease in MR, which was restored after partial insulin replacement, was a reflection of the reduced MS. There were no significant differences between the parameters of maternal behavior monitored in control and diabetic animals. Blood glucose in diabetic dams was significantly increased over that of controls. Although the levels of plasma glucose in the insulin-replaced groups were significantly lower than those of their uncontrolled diabetic counterparts, they also remained higher than that of controls. Corticosterone was not significantly altered after induction of diabetes. Insulin and C-peptide levels were significantly reduced in the uncontrolled diabetics; however, insulin levels were corrected in the insulin-replaced groups. Serum levels of prolactin decreased in all diabetic groups and insulin failed to restore these levels to those of control animals. In conclusion, it appears that diabetes decreases lactation through a suppressive effect on MS rather than on MR, with insulin replacement correcting for such deficiency. In addition, despite the lactogenic importance of glucocorticoids, prolactin and insulin demonstrated in vitro, lactation in vivo can be corrected without returning the levels of all three hormones to normal. The importance of another factor(s), such as normoglycemia, as essential to the observed defects, needs to be investigated.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f61000860a","authors":["Robert L.
