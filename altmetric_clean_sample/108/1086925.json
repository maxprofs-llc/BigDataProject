However, thymoquinone suffers from high hydrophobicity causing poor solubility which limits its bioavailability and high lipophilicity causing poor formulation characteristics. Liposomes are versatile drug carriers that can be used to solve problems of drug solubility, instability, and bio-distribution. In this study, we were able to prepare thymoquinone-loaded liposomes (TQ-LP) and thymoquinone loaded in liposomes modified with Triton X-100 (XLP) with diameters of about 100 nm, and entrapment efficiency of more than 90% for TQ-LP and of 49.6% for XLP. The TQ-LP liposomes were effective in suppressing the proliferation of breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and T47D, and at the same time exerting very low toxicity on normal periodontal ligament fibroblast. Altogether, this report describes the first successful encapsulation of thymoquinone into liposome; which maintains stability, improves bioavailability and maintains its anticancer activity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5233cf058f610003ba9","authors":["Fadwa Odeh","Odeh F","Ismail SI","Abu-Dahab R","Mahmoud IS","Al Bawab A"],"doi":"10.3109\/10717544.2012.727500","first_seen_on":"2012-11-24T04:37:48+00:00","issns":["1071-7544","1521-0464"],"issue":"8","journal":"Drug Delivery","last_mentioned_on":1353731860,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/10717544.2012.727500","http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/10717544.2012.727500?ai=9iw&mi=3j7h3l&af=R&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/10717544.2012.727500"],"pmid":"23043626","pubdate":"2012-10-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Thymoquinone in liposomes: a study of loading efficiency and biological activity towards breast cancer","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/thymoquinone-liposomes-study-loading-efficiency-biological-activity-towards-breast-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3073280,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":951332,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279662,"mean":5.8811992233453,"rank":188339,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":53175,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279662,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164,"mean":0.67355828220859,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":90,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.41666666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
