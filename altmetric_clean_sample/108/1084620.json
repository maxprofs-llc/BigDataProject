The bifunctional N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester of mercaptoacetyltriglycine with S-acetyl protection of the sulfhydryl group may be used to conjugate MAG3 to primary amine functionalized biomolecules for the purpose of radiolabeling with 99mTc for gamma detection or single photon emission computed tomography imaging (SPECT). We report here an improved MAG3 conjugation and 99mTc radiolabeling method capable of generating high radiochemical yield and high specific radioactivity. Post-labeling purification will not be needed if the protocol is followed as presented. Apart from the preparation of reagents, the conjugation and purification requires about 4 h, while the labeling with 99mTc requires about an additional 30 min.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f61000825c","authors":["Yi Wang","Guozheng Liu","Donald J Hnatowich"],"doi":"10.1038\/nprot.2006.262","endpage":"1480","first_seen_on":"2012-11-22T19:03:53+00:00","issns":["1754-2189","1750-2799"],"journal":"Nature Protocols","last_mentioned_on":1349367780,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nprot\/journal\/v1\/n3\/full\/nprot.2006.262.html"],"pmid":"17406438","pubdate":"2006-11-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1477","subjects":["science","clinicallaboratorytechniques"],"title":"Methods for MAG3 conjugation and 99mTc radiolabeling of biomolecules","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/methods-mag3-conjugation-99mtc-radiolabeling-biomolecules"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3636263,"mean":4.9213309833055,"rank":602749,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":3018172,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3636263,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275166,"mean":5.6421579924775,"rank":51559,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":222778,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275166,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":809,"mean":4.6435717821782,"rank":176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":579,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":809,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":15.266827586207,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
