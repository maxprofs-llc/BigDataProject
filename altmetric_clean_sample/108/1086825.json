Liquid-formula diets containing 40% of the calories from the test fat were fed in random order for 3 wk each, with lipoprotein concentrations measured on the last five days. Butter fat raised low-density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations the most (4.23 +\/- .15 mmol\/L; mean +\/- SE). Beef-tallow feeding resulted in significantly lower concentrations of LDL (4.03 +\/- 0.18 mmol\/L); cocoa butter resulted in even lower concentrations (3.82 +\/- .15 mmol\/L). The lowest concentration of LDL was observed with olive oil (3.62 +\/- 0.18 mmol\/L). Fecal excretion of fatty acids, after adjustment for fecal flow, indicated that oleic acid (C18:1) was 99% absorbed, palmitic acid (C16:0) was 96-97% absorbed, and stearic acid was 90-94% absorbed for the three fats containing significant amounts of stearic acid.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005700","authors":["S M Grundy"],"first_seen_on":"2012-11-24T02:24:00+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1938-3207","0002-9165"],"issue":"6","journal":"American Journal of Clinical Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1353723427,"links":["http:\/\/ajcn.nutrition.org\/content\/54\/6\/1036.short"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ajcn.nutrition.org\/content\/54\/6\/1036.full.pdf","pmid":"1845606","pubdate":"1991-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Effects of fats high in stearic acid on lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in men.","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-fats-high-stearic-acid-lipid-lipoprotein-concentrations-men"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3073288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":951311,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279663,"mean":5.8812624024715,"rank":188340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":53163,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279663,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4775,"mean":14.727648093842,"rank":3944,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":569,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4775,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278,"mean":34.991119133574,"rank":259,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
