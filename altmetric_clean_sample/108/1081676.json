Not uncommonly, SCS can dramatically improve a patient's quality of life, and those who are in the childbearing years may go on to become pregnant. The purpose of this case series is to describe: 1) implantation considerations in women of childbearing age; 2) use of rechargeable systems; 3) the obstetric and anesthetic concerns in patients with spinal cord stimulators; 4) risks of using SCS in the peripartum period.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f61000319a","authors":["Bernardini, Donald J.","Pratt, Stephen D.","Takoudes, Tamara C.","Simopoulos, Thomas T."],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1525-1403.2010.00288.x","endpage":"274","first_seen_on":"2012-11-21T17:46:59+00:00","issns":["1525-1403","1094-7159"],"issue":"4","journal":"Neuromodulation","last_mentioned_on":1353448234,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1525-1403.2010.00288.x\/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage&userIsAuthenticated=false"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1525-1403.2010.00288.x\/pdf","pmid":"21992881","pubdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Inc","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"270","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Spinal Cord Stimulation and the Pregnant Patient\u00e2\u0080\u0090Specific Considerations for Management: A Case Series and Review of the Literature","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/spinal-cord-stimulation-pregnant-patientspecific-considerations-management-case-series-review-litera-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630432,"mean":4.9299514944696,"rank":2741739,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":730791,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630432,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275138,"mean":5.6489384488456,"rank":202073,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":56279,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275138,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238,"mean":2.0572489451477,"rank":116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":1.4547619047619,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
