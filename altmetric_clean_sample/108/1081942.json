Our objective was to undertake a survey of local resource allocaters in the English National Health Services in order to map and explore current priority-setting activity. A national survey was sent to Directors of Commissioning in English Primary Care Trusts (PCTs). The survey was designed to provide a picture of the types of priority-setting activities and techniques that are in place and offer some assessment of their perceived effectiveness. There is variation in the scale, aims and methods of priority-setting functions across PCTs. A perceived strength of priority-setting processes is in relation to the use of particular tools and\/or development of formal processes that are felt to increase transparency. Perceived weaknesses tended to lie in the inability to sufficiently engage with a range of stakeholders. Although a number of formal priority-setting processes have been developed, there are a series of remaining challenges such as ensuring priority-setting goes beyond the margins and is embedded in budget management, and the development of disinvestment as well as investment strategies. Furthermore, if we are genuinely interested in a more explicit approach to priority-setting, then fostering a more inclusive and transparent process will be required.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5933cf058f610004f69","authors":["Iestyn Williams","Robinson S","Dickinson H","Freeman T","Rumbold B","Williams I","Suzanne Robinson","Helen Dickinson","Tim Freeman","Benedict Rumbold"],"doi":"10.1258\/hsmr.2012.012007","endpage":"120","first_seen_on":"2012-11-21T20:34:00+00:00","issns":["1758-1044","0951-4848"],"issue":"3","journal":"Health Services Management Research","last_mentioned_on":1353493385,"links":["http:\/\/hsmr.rsmjournals.com\/content\/25\/3\/113.abstract)"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/hsmr.rsmjournals.com\/content\/25\/3\/113.full.pdf","pmid":"23135885","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"113","subjects":["healthservicesresearch","healthservices"],"title":"Structures and processes for priority-setting by health-care funders: a national survey of primary care trusts in England","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/10.1258\/hsmr.2012.012007","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structures-processes-prioritysetting-healthcare-funders-national-survey-primary-care-trusts-england"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630978,"mean":4.9279868812221,"rank":2899062,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":80091,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630978,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275150,"mean":5.6467706588068,"rank":218799,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1015,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275150,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":3.4736842105263,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":3.0125,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
