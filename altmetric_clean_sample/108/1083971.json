The strategies include upregulation of beta adrenergic receptors, conversion of myocytes into pacemaker cells and stem cell therapy. Pacemaker activity in adult ventricular myocytes is normally repressed by the inward rectifier potassium current (I(K1)). The I(K1) current is encoded by the Kir2 gene family. Use of a negative construct that suppresses current when expressed with wild-type Kir2.1 is an experimental approach for genesis of genetic pacemaker. Hyperpolarisation activated cyclic nucleotide gated (HCN) channels which generate If current, the pacemaker current of heart can be delivered to heart by using stem cell therapy approach and viral vectors. The unresolved issues include longevity and stability of pacemaker genes, limitations involved in adenoviral and stem cell therapy and creation of genetic pacemakers which can compete with the electronic units.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f610007763","authors":["G Rajesh","Johnson Francis"],"first_seen_on":"2012-11-22T17:47:37+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"1","journal":"Indian Pacing and Electrophysiology Journal","last_mentioned_on":1351266720,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1501094\/"],"pmid":"16943888","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Indian Heart Rhythm Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","title":"Biological Pacemakers","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biological-pacemakers-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.048,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.048},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629591,"mean":4.9337473984712,"rank":592060,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":3036140,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629591,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275086,"mean":5.657519893851,"rank":51269,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":223798,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275086,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":3.2606451612903,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
