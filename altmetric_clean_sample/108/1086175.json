In addition, the clinicopathological features of BRCA1-associated breast cancer in Chinese women were not well investigated. In this study, we screened the complete coding regions and exon-intron boundaries of BRCA1 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-sequencing assay. Immunohistochemistry analyses were performed on tumor samples to detect the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), P53, and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2). Breast cancer patients having one or more affected relatives referred from the Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, eastern China during 2008-2011 were selected for the study. A total of 62 familial breast cancer patients received the BRCA1 germ-line mutation screening. Five deleterious mutations were detected in this cohort. The mutation rate was 11.3% (7\/62). We found two novel mutations (3414delC and 5,280 C > T) and two recurrent mutations (5,273 G > A and 5589del8). BRCA1 mutation tumors tended to be negative for ER, PR, and HER-2, and exhibited high histological grade compared with tumors without BRCA1 mutations. Our study suggests that recurrent mutations may exist in eastern Chinese women with familial breast cancer and PCR-sequencing assay is a useful tool to screen these mutations. It also suggests that BRCA1-associated breast cancers in Chinese women exhibit an aggressive phenotype.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008e6e","authors":["Cao, Wenming","Wang, Xiaojia","Gao, Yun","Yang, Hongjian","Li, Ji\u2010Cheng"],"doi":"10.1002\/ar.22628","endpage":"278","first_seen_on":"2012-11-23T17:50:56+00:00","issns":["1932-8494","1932-8486"],"issue":"2","journal":"The Anatomical Record: Advances in Integrative Anatomy and Evolutionary Biology","last_mentioned_on":1354686501,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ar.22628\/abstract;jsessionid=C133C55543DA74B2F52F4073029B67A5.d03t03","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ar.22628\/abstract;jsessionid=9423D0125E7BD1168E8AAF914502C5E0.d02t02?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+on+8+December+from+10%3A00-12%3A00+GMT+%2805%3A00-07%3A00+EST%29+for+essential+maintenance"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ar.22628\/pdf","pmid":"23175448","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","startpage":"273","subjects":["anatomy"],"title":"BRCA1 Germ\u00e2\u0080\u0090Line Mutations and Tumor Characteristics in Eastern Chinese Women with Familial Breast Cancer","type":"article","volume":"296","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/brca1-germline-mutations-tumor-characteristics-eastern-chinese-women-familial-breast-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6326345,"mean":5.9762354083184,"rank":2424868,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3828396,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6326345,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275998,"mean":6.4145395131106,"rank":101467,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":170603,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275998,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":348,"mean":5.0718616714697,"rank":120,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":227,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":348,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":2.8797894736842,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
