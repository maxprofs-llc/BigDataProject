The amount of adsorbed D(2) was evidently larger than H(2) for all samples. The maximum adsorption ratio difference between D(2) and H(2) was 40% for zeolite (MS13X), yielding a selectivity for D(2) with respect to H(2) of 3.05.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Subaru Niimura"],"doi":"10.1021\/ja305809u","first_seen_on":"2012-11-20T23:43:36+00:00","issns":["0002-7863"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1353455010,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/full\/10.1021\/ja305809u"],"pmid":"23116187","pubdate":"2012-11-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Dynamic Quantum Molecular Sieving Separation of D2 from H2\u2013D2 Mixture with Nanoporous Materials","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dynamic-quantum-molecular-sieving-separation-d2-h-2d2-mixture-nanoporous-materials"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3073416,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":951524,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279395,"mean":5.8728022649018,"rank":188185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":53166,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279395,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15478,"mean":4.1037725657427,"rank":11773,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":2909,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15478,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":428,"mean":4.840074941452,"rank":290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":97,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":428,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
