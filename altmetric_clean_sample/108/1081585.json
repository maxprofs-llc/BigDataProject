The accuracy of the method and its limitations are evidenced through the analysis of a multilayer and of self-assembled islands.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000877","authors":["Picco, Andrea"],"doi":"10.1186\/1556-276x-7-633","first_seen_on":"2012-11-21T17:23:30+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Nanoscale Research Letters","last_mentioned_on":1353502863,"links":["http:\/\/www.nanoscalereslett.com\/content\/7\/1\/633"],"pmid":"23171543","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemistry\/Food Science, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Engineering, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Material Science","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Materials Science, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Molecular Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Physics, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Condensed Matter Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Materials Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"title":"Composition profiling of inhomogeneous SiGe nanostructures by Raman spectroscopy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/composition-profiling-inhomogeneous-sige-nanostructures-raman-spectroscopy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630815,"mean":4.9285062716012,"rank":2899201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":79902,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630815,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275147,"mean":5.6472838638397,"rank":218812,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1005,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275147,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":380,"mean":0.91234828496042,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":380,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120,"mean":0.48109243697479,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
