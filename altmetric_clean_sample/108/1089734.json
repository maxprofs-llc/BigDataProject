Detailed structural analysis has revealed that the Gal residues are attached to the N- and O-linked oligosaccharides via \u03b11,2- or \u03b11,3-linkages. Previously we constructed and characterized a septuple \u03b1-galactosyltransferase disruptant (7GalT\u0394) anticipating a complete lack of \u03b1-Gal residues. However, the 7GalT\u0394 strain still contained oligosaccharides consisting of \u03b11,3-linked Gal residues, indicating the presence of at least one more additional unidentified \u03b11,3-galactosyltransferase. In this study we searched for unidentified putative glycosyltransferases in the S. pombe genome sequence and identified three novel genes, named otg1(+)-otg3(+) (\u03b1 one, three-galactosyltransferase), that belong to glycosyltransferase gene family 8 in the Carbohydrate Active EnZymes (CAZY) database. Gal-recognizing lectin blotting and HPLC analyses of pyridylaminated oligosaccharides after deletion of these three additional genes from 7GalT\u0394 strain demonstrated that the resultant disruptant missing 10 \u03b1-galactosyltransferase genes, 10GalT\u0394, exhibited a complete loss of galactosylation. In an in vitro galactosylation assay, the otg2(+) gene product had Gal transfer activity toward a pyridylaminated Man(9)GlcNAc(2) oligosaccharide and pyridylaminated Man\u03b11,2-Man\u03b11,2-Man oligosaccharide. In addition, the otg3(+) gene product exhibited Gal transfer activity toward the pyridylaminated Man(9)GlcNAc(2) oligosaccharide. Generation of an \u03b11,3-linkage was confirmed by HPLC analysis, \u03b1-galactosidase digestion analysis, (1)H NMR spectroscopy, and LC-MS\/MS analysis. These results indicate that Otg2p and Otg3p are involved in \u03b11,3-galactosylation of S. pombe oligosaccharides.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Kaoru Takegawa"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m112.347351","first_seen_on":"2012-11-26T15:49:46+00:00","issns":["1083-351X"],"journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1352515543,"links":["http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/287\/46\/38866"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/287\/46\/38866.full.pdf","pmid":"22988247","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Identification of Novel \u03b11,3-Galactosyltransferase and Elimination of \u03b1-Galactose-containing Glycans by Disruption of Multiple \u03b1-Galactosyltransferase Genes in Schizosaccharomyces pombe","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-novel-13galactosyltransferase-elimination-galactosecontaining-glycans-disruption-mult"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627649,"mean":4.9475528391989,"rank":2905947,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":74380,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627649,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275295,"mean":5.674147776559,"rank":219670,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":516,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275295,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28042,"mean":2.6462110481081,"rank":24529,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":1748,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28042,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1607,"mean":2.8764943960149,"rank":1429,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1607,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
