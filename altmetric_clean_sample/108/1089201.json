The ER plays crucial roles in the biosynthesis and transport of proteins and lipids, and in calcium (Ca(2+) ) regulation in compartmentalized eukaryotic cells including plant cells. To support its well-segregated functions, the shape of the ER undergoes notable changes in response to both developmental cues and outside influences. In this review, we will discuss recent findings on molecular mechanisms underlying the unique morphology and dynamics of the ER, and the importance of the interconnected ER network in cell polarity. In animal and yeast cells, two family proteins, the reticulons and DP1\/Yop1, are required for shaping high-curvature ER tubules, while members of the atlastin family of dynamin-like GTPases are involved in the fusion of ER tubules to make an interconnected ER network. In plant cells, recent data also indicate that the reticulons are involved in shaping ER tubules, while RHD3, a plant member of the atlastin GTPases, is required for the generation of an interconnected ER network. We will also summarize the current knowledge on how the ER interacts with other membrane-bound organelles, with a focus on how the ER and Golgi interplay in plant cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610004018","authors":["Chen, Jun","Doyle, Caitlin","Qi, Xingyun","Zheng, Huanquan"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1744-7909.2012.01176.x","endpage":"850","first_seen_on":"2012-11-26T10:10:15+00:00","issns":["1744-7909","1672-9072"],"issue":"11","journal":"Journal of Integrative Plant Biology","last_mentioned_on":1353924826,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1744-7909.2012.01176.x\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1744-7909.2012.01176.x\/pdf","pmid":"23046093","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Asia","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"840","subjects":["botany"],"title":"The Endoplasmic Reticulum: A Social Network in Plant CellsF","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/endoplasmic-reticulum-social-network-plant-cells-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6695002,"mean":6.1599261935862,"rank":2945726,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":3692759,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6695002,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282283,"mean":6.3853748166727,"rank":125031,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":153695,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282283,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252,"mean":2.0092509960159,"rank":83,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":164,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.6478260869565,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
