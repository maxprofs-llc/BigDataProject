Although Pythium insidiosum, Conidiobolus species, and Basidiobolus species have been recognized as pathogens for several years, members of the genus Lagenidium have been identified as a cause of oomycosis in dogs only recently. Pythiosis, lagenidiosis, and zygomycosis share similar clinical and histologic characteristics, making them difficult to distinguish from one another; however, distinguishing between these pathogens is important because of differences in epidemiology, choice and duration of therapy, and prognosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008c6e","authors":["Amy M Grooters"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T03:05:47+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0195-5616"],"issue":"4","journal":"Veterinary Clinics of North America: Small Animal Practice","last_mentioned_on":1240160256,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12910739"],"pmid":"12910739","pubdate":"2003-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Pythiosis, lagenidiosis, and zygomycosis in small animals.","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pythiosis-lagenidiosis-zygomycosis-small-animals"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4409947,"mean":4.8306983503683,"rank":982690,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2856506,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4409947,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":144983,"mean":7.695211998731,"rank":39503,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":103676,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":144983,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235,"mean":1.6699658119658,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":192,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.45,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Ph.
