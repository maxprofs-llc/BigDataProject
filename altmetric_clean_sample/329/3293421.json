To test for potential immunosuppressive factors, a series of T cell lines and clones were established from patients with acute kala azar, from patients after chemotherapy for kala azar, and from skin test-positive adults from the same endemic region. Although CD4+ T cell lines and clones could be readily established from the skin test-positive adults, lines and clones from acute or treated patients were heavily biased in expression of CD8+. The CD8+ cells from acute patients did not themselves release cytokines in response to leishmania antigens in vitro, but markedly affected the cytokine profile of peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated 1 yr later after recovery. Addition of the CD8+ cells caused inhibition of lymphoproliferation and IFN-gamma release, with augmentation of IL-6 and IL-10 release. The inhibitory effects of the CD8+ cells could be partially abrogated by antibodies to IL-10 but not by antibodies to IL-4. Analysis of four patients with acute kala azar demonstrated release of IL-10 that could not be demonstrated in supernatants from asymptomatic skin test-positive individuals. Generation of IL-10 may contribute to the profound suppression of IFN-gamma release that occurs during kala azar due to Leishmania chagasi.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cff","authors":["B J Holaday","M M Pompeu","S Jeronimo","M J Texeira","A de A Sousa","A W Vasconcelos","R D Pearson","J S Abrams","R M Locksley"],"doi":"10.1172\/jci116878","first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T03:05:57+00:00","issns":["0021-9738"],"journal":"Journal of Clinical Investigation","last_mentioned_on":1379150075,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1172\/JCI116878","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8254019","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC288459"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jci.org\/articles\/view\/116878\/files\/pdf","pmid":"8254019","publisher":"American Society for Clinical Investigation","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Potential role for interleukin-10 in the immunosuppression associated with kala azar.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/potential-role-interleukin10-immunosuppression-associated-kala-azar"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629240,"mean":4.9358355666342,"rank":816571,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2289830,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629240,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94059,"mean":8.0805330328097,"rank":24348,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68627,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94059,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4192,"mean":9.1312307325221,"rank":1584,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":1737,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4192,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":32.145888888889,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
