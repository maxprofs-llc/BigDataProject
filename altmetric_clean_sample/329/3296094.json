We claim that the differences between short-range and long-range motion phenomena are a direct consequence of the stimuli used in the two paradigms and are not evidence for the existence of two qualitatively different motion processes. We propose that a single style of motion analysis, similar to the well known Reichardt and Marr-Ullman motion detectors, underlies all motion phenomena. Although there are different detectors of this type specialized for different visual attributes (namely first-order and second-order stimuli), they all share the same mode of operation. We review the studies of second-order motion stimuli to show that they share the basic phenomena observed for first-order stimuli. The similarity across stimulus types suggests, not parallel streams of motion extraction, one short-range and passive and the other long-range and intelligent, but a concatenation of a common mode of initial motion extraction followed by a general inference process.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f61000359e","authors":["P Cavanagh","G Mather"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T04:17:50+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0169-1015"],"issue":"2-3","journal":"Spatial Vision","last_mentioned_on":1211625670,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2487159"],"pmid":"2487159","pubdate":"1989-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Physical Sciences","Psychology","Computer Science"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Motion: the long and short of it.","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/motion-long-short-itsee-comment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628758,"mean":4.9386506288559,"rank":816811,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2289028,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628758,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94011,"mean":8.072900117009,"rank":24332,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68596,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94011,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":2.4191764705882,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Psychology":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Motion perception","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=214605430#altmetric_citation_0","license":"public","citation_ids":[2951594,3296094],"posted_on":"2008-05-24T10:41:10+00:00","summary":"Motion perception is the process of inferring the speed and direction of elements in a scene based on visual, vestibular and proprioceptive inputs.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=1534578","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"DOI bot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:DOI bot"}}]}}
