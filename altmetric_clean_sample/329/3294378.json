Plateau-phase cells were pre-exposed to an adapting dose of 0.1 to 1.5 Gy low-dose-rate gamma radiation 3.5 h prior to an acute challenge dose of 4 Gy. No adapting dose improved clonogenic survival detectably, whether the cells were plated immediately after the acute exposure or held in plateau phase for 3.5 h before plating. However, all chronic adapting doses resulted in both a reduction in micronucleus frequency in binucleate cells and about a twofold reduction in neoplastic transformation frequency per viable cell when cells were subsequently exposed to the 4-Gy challenge dose. Our data suggest that a low-dose-rate pre-exposure to ionizing radiation induces an adaptive response in C3H 10T1\/2 cells, and that this response enhances DNA double-strand break repair when cells are subsequently exposed to a second radiation dose. This enhanced repair appears to be error-free since these adapted cells are also less susceptible to radiation-induced neoplastic transformation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f6100086d3","authors":["E I Azzam","G P Raaphorst","R E Mitchel"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T03:26:29+00:00","issns":["0033-7587"],"issue":"1 Suppl","journal":"Radiation Research","last_mentioned_on":1207045236,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8146320"],"pmid":"8146320","pubdate":"1994-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["radiology","genetics"],"title":"Radiation-induced adaptive response for protection against micronucleus formation and neoplastic transformation in C3H 10T1\/2 mouse embryo cells.","type":"article","volume":"138","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/radiationinduced-adaptive-response-protection-against-micronucleus-formation-neoplastic-transformati"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631265,"mean":4.9266893682253,"rank":816091,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2292772,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631265,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94397,"mean":8.1049837493116,"rank":24505,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68802,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94397,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":514,"mean":3.4954346978558,"rank":80,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":301,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":514,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.4913043478261,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
