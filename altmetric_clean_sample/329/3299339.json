A 40-year-old female was admitted to our hospital because of sudden onset of genital bleeding. Her blood cell count showed severe anemia and thrombocytopenia. Biochemistry disclosed high titers of serum LDH. Based upon these findings, the patient was initially diagnosed as having Evans syndrome and was treated with steroid-pulse therapy and high-dose immunoglobulin. However, no response was obtained. A diagnosis of TTP was established when mental disturbance and renal dysfunction developed later. Aspirin and plasmapheresis relieved the mental disturbance and decreased serum LDH level, but anemia and thrombocytopenia were not corrected. Slow infusion therapy of 1 to 2 mg VCR was performed for 4 to 8 hours once a week, which dramatically improved the hematological abnormalities and controlled the disease. In conclusion, slow infusion of VCR may indicated, if initial standard therapies such as PE would fail.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9283cf058f61000dd1e","authors":["K Yokoyama","M Kojima","S Komatsumoto","M Nara","M Nakano","Y Ikeda","K Toyama"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T06:04:49+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0485-1439"],"issue":"8","journal":"[Rinsh\u014d ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology","last_mentioned_on":1194840204,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1404865"],"pmid":"1404865","pubdate":"1992-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"[Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura achieving complete remission by slow infusion of vincristine].","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/thrombotic-thrombocytopenic-purpura-achieving-complete-remission-slow-infusion-vincristine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635018,"mean":4.9199431259457,"rank":816426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295125,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635018,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94862,"mean":8.1439016666492,"rank":24717,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69049,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94862,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":0.84126984126984,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":59,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.975,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Evans syndrome","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=170895876#altmetric_citation_15","license":"public","citation_ids":[3299339],"posted_on":"2007-11-12T04:03:24+00:00","summary":"Evans syndrome is an autoimmune disease in which an individual's antibodies attack their own red blood cells and platelets.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=1657789","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Davidruben","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Davidruben"}}]}}
