All these patients suffered from malignant disease, but neoplastic cells had not been reported on conventional cytological examination. In 12 of the 41 cases immunocytochemical staining revealed previously unrecognised malignant cells. This represents an increase in diagnostic accuracy of approximately 20% and suggests that immunocytochemical labelling should be used routinely for the examination of cytologically negative samples from patients with suspected malignant disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d02","authors":["A K Ghosh","D Y Mason","A I Spriggs"],"doi":"10.1136\/jcp.36.10.1150","first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T02:29:30+00:00","issns":["1472-4146"],"journal":"Journal of Clinical Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1262631619,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/jcp.36.10.1150"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jcp.bmj.com\/content\/36\/10\/1150.full.pdf","pmid":"6194182","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Immunocytochemical staining with monoclonal antibodies in cytologically \"negative\" serous effusions from patients with malignant disease.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/immunocytochemical-staining-monoclonal-antibodies-cytologically-negative-serous-effusions-patients-m"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628675,"mean":4.9393923648184,"rank":816895,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288833,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628675,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93991,"mean":8.0721959570169,"rank":24329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68579,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93991,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1026,"mean":2.716236097561,"rank":197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":674,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1026,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":2.5581395348837,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"BE":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Hybridoma technology","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=335851757#altmetric_citation_6","license":"public","citation_ids":[3291860],"posted_on":"2010-01-04T19:00:19+00:00","summary":"Hybridoma technology is a technology of forming hybrid cell lines (called hybridomas) by fusing an antibody-producing B cell with a myeloma (B cell cancer) cell that is selected for its ability to grow in tissue culture and for an absence of antibody chain","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=1169523","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Citation bot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Citation bot"}}]}}
