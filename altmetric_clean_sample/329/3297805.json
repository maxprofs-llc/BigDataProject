Inhibitors of pore formation have been found which protect blood, endothelial and epithelial cells from the destructive effect of complement lesions. Recently, a pore-forming protein showing immunological crossreactivity to complement C9 has been found in the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, thereby extending this protein family and generalizing its means of generating non-selective membrane permeability.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a0","authors":["M C Peitsch","J Tschopp"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T05:16:15+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0955-0674"],"issue":"4","journal":"Current Opinion in Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1188028900,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1722985"],"pmid":"1722985","pubdate":"1991-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Assembly of macromolecular pores by immune defense systems.","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/assembly-macromolecular-pores-immune-defense-systems"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3992137,"mean":5.0363955227607,"rank":917213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2528914,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3992137,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124274,"mean":9.0028236742579,"rank":37378,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":85187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124274,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":530,"mean":2.1790283553875,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":275,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":530,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":2.3304444444444,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
