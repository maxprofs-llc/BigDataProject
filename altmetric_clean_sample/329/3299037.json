It has been assumed that the proton motive force of the cytoplasmic membrane through the interaction of the TonB protein with the TonB box of the cork opens the FhuA channel. Yet, deletion of the cork results in an FhuA derivative, FhuADelta5-160, that still displays TonB-dependent substrate transport and phage receptor activity. To investigate this unexpected finding further, we constructed FhuADelta5-160 derivatives of FhuA proteins from Salmonella paratyphi B, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Pantoea agglomerans. The FhuADelta5-160 proteins inserted correctly into the outer membrane, and with the exception of the P. agglomerans protein, transported ferrichrome and albomycin. FhuA hybrids consisting of the beta-barrel of one strain and the cork of another strain were active and showed higher TonB-dependent ferrichrome transport rates than the corkless derivatives. Exceptions were the E. coli beta-barrel\/Salmonella serovar Typhimurium cork hybrid protein and the Salmonella serovar Typhimurium beta-barrel\/P. agglomerans cork hybrid protein, both of which were less active than the beta-barrels alone. Each of the FhuA mutant proteins displayed activity for each of their ligands, except for phage T5, only when coupled to TonB. The hybrid FhuA proteins displayed a similar activity with the E. coli TonB protein as with their cognate TonB proteins. Sensitivity to phages T1, T5, and phi80, rifamycin CGP 4832, and colicin M was determined by the beta-barrel, whereas sensitivity to phage ES18 and microcin J25 required both the beta-barrel and cork domains. These results demonstrate that the beta-barrel domain of FhuA confers activity and specificity and responds to TonB and that the cork domains of various FhuA proteins can be interchanged and contribute to the activities of the FhuA hybrids.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cba","authors":["Helmut Killmann","Michael Braun","Christina Herrmann","Volkmar Braun"],"doi":"10.1128\/jb.183.11.3476-3487.2001","first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T05:56:47+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1098-5530","0021-9193"],"issue":"11","journal":"Journal of Bacteriology","last_mentioned_on":1400679795,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1128\/jb.183.11.3476-3487.2001"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jb.asm.org\/content\/183\/11\/3476.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC99646","pmid":"11344156","pubdate":"2001-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["bacteriology"],"title":"FhuA Barrel-Cork Hybrids Are Active Transporters and Receptors","type":"article","volume":"183","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fhua-barrelcork-hybrids-active-transporters-receptors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3788521,"mean":4.9964021454353,"rank":863956,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2399781,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3788521,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114054,"mean":8.8242448510781,"rank":33263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":79477,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114054,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3093,"mean":2.7067723156533,"rank":419,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":1372,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3093,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":1.2645161290323,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
