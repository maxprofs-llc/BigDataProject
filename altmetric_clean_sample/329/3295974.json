Strains of A. terreus were characterized by ITS, \u03b2-tubulin and calmodulin sequences. Mating type was identified by amplifying and sequencing MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 genes. One MAT1-2 strain produced hyphal masses when crossed with four MAT1-1 strains on mixed cereal agar after 3 wk at 37 C. Cleistothecia formed inside the hyphal masses and produced asci containing smooth-walled ascospores with an equatorial protuberance. This is the first report of sexual reproduction in A. terreus.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f61000313d","authors":["Michael Arabatzis","Aristea Velegraki"],"doi":"10.3852\/11-426","first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T04:14:41+00:00","issns":["1557-2536"],"journal":"Mycologia","last_mentioned_on":1393436137,"links":["http:\/\/www.mycologia.org\/cgi\/pmidlookup?view=short&pmid=23074177","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3852\/11-426","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23074177"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mycologia.org\/content\/105\/1\/71.full.pdf","pmid":"23074177","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Sexual reproduction in the opportunistic human pathogen Aspergillus terreus","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sexual-reproduction-opportunistic-human-pathogen-iaspergillus-terreusi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627150,"mean":4.9502167410311,"rank":817750,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2285986,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627150,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93628,"mean":8.0126217223665,"rank":24185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68360,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93628,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":927,"mean":2.982101511879,"rank":85,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":146,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":927,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.62,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Aspergillus","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=597250183#altmetric_citation_7","license":"public","citation_ids":[3295974],"posted_on":"2014-02-26T17:35:37+00:00","summary":"Aspergillus is a genus consisting of a few hundred mold species found in various climates worldwide.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=1529518","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Chaya5260","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Chaya5260"}},{"title":"Aspergillus terreus","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=595055833#altmetric_citation_14","license":"public","citation_ids":[3295974],"posted_on":"2014-02-11T23:42:43+00:00","summary":"Aspergillus terreus, also known as Aspergillus terrestrius, is a fungus (mold) found worldwide in soil.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=10589669","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Chaya5260","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Chaya5260"}}]}}
