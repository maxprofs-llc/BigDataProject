We determined the crystal structure of a fragment (synC) consisting of residues 110-420 of bovine synapsin I; synC coincides with the large middle domain (C-domain), the most conserved domain of synapsins. SynC molecules are folded into compact domains and form closely associated dimers. SynC monomers are strikingly similar in structure to a family of ATP-utilizing enzymes, which includes glutathione synthetase and D-alanine:D-alanine ligase. SynC binds ATP in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The crystal structure of synC in complex with ATPgammaS and Ca2+ explains the preference of synC for Ca2+ over Mg2+. Our results suggest that synapsins may also be ATP-utilizing enzymes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027b6","authors":["Lothar Esser","Chyung\u2010Ru Wang","Masahiro Hosaka","Cynthia S.
