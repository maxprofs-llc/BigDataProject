Max readily homodimerizes, competes with C-myc-Max heterodimers, and represses transcription. Four additional bHLH-ZIP proteins, Mad1, Mxi1, Mad3 and Mad4, heterodimerize with Max and also repress transcription of c-myc-responsive genes. We employed a yeast two-hybid approach to identify proteins which interact with Mxi. We identified a novel ZIP-containing protein, Mmip1 (Mad member-interacting protein 1) that strongly dimerizes with all four Mad members, but not with c-myc, Max, or with unrelated HLH proteins. The Mmip1-Mxi association is mediated by the ZIP domain of each polypeptide and is as strong or stronger than the associations between c-myc and Max or Max and Mxi1. In vitro, Mmip1 can inhibit DNA binding by Max-Mad heterodimers and, in vivo, can reverse the suppressive effects of Mad proteins on c-myc functions. Mmipl is found in a variety of cells types, is induced by serum stimulation, and can be co-immunoprecipitated from fibroblasts in association with Mxi1. By interfering with the dimerization between Max and Mad family member proteins, Mmip1 can indirectly up-regulate the transcriptional activity of c-myc and suppress the antiproliferative actions of Mad proteins.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003240","authors":["Gupta, K","Anand, G","Yin, X","Grove, L","Prochownik, E V"],"doi":"10.1038\/sj.onc.1201634","first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T02:07:37+00:00","issns":["0950-9232"],"issue":"9","journal":"Oncogene","last_mentioned_on":1198199127,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/sj.onc.1201634","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9528857"],"pmid":"9528857","pubdate":"1998-03-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","neoplasms"],"title":"Mmip1: a novel leucine zipper protein that reverses the suppressive effects of Mad family members on c-myc.","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mmip1-novel-leucine-zipper-protein-reverses-suppressive-effects-mad-family-members-cmyc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3990946,"mean":5.0359116822855,"rank":917726,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2528939,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3990946,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124088,"mean":8.9947024861992,"rank":37449,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":85191,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124088,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3470,"mean":2.6081527817815,"rank":334,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1762,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3470,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":2.518115942029,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":61,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
