Two types of preference can result in homogamy: individuals may prefer someone who is similar to themselves (self-referent phenotype matching) or to their parents (a sexual-imprinting-like mechanism). In order to examine these possibilities, we compare faces of couples and their family members in two ways. First, \"perceived\" similarity between a pair of faces is quantified as similarity ratings given to the pair. Second, \"physical\" similarity between two groups of faces is evaluated on the basis of correlations in principal component scores generated from facial measurements. Our results demonstrate a tendency to homogamy in facial characteristics and suggest that the tendency is due primarily to self-referent phenotype matching. Nevertheless, the presence of a sexual-imprinting-like effect is also partially indicated: whether individuals are involved in facial homogamy may be affected by their relationship with their parents during childhood.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002a11","doi":"10.1007\/s12110-012-9146-8","first_seen_on":"2012-07-10T08:36:10+00:00","issns":["1936-4776"],"journal":"Human Nature","last_mentioned_on":1342032294,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22773169?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22773169","pubdate":"2012-07-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Anthropology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Behavioural Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biological Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Social Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Anthropology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["socialsciences"],"title":"Human Homogamy in Facial Characteristics : Does a Sexual-Imprinting-Like Mechanism Play a Role?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/human-homogamy-facial-characteristics-sexualimprintinglike-mechanism-play-role"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":839676,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":3661359,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75491,"mean":5.0906270499404,"rank":13978,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":61372,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75491,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":202,"mean":14.855124378109,"rank":95,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":106,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":202,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":19.337333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
