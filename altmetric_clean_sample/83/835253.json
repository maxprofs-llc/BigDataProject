Subjects teed-off 20 times aiming at a green 135 meters from the tee area.\nPS supplementation significantly increased (p < 0.05) the number of good ball flights (mean: pre-test 8.3 +\/- 3.5, post-test 10.1 +\/- 3.0), whereas placebo intake (mean: pre-test 7.8 +\/- 2.4, post-test 7.9 +\/- 3.6) had no effect. PS supplementation showed a trend towards improving perceived stress levels during teeing-off (mean: pre-test 5.8 +\/- 2.0, post-test 4.0 +\/- 2.0, p = 0.07), whereas stress levels remained unchanged in the placebo group (mean: pre-test: 5.1 +\/- 2.0, post-test: 5.1 +\/- 3.1). Supplementation did not influence mean heart rate in either group.\nIt is concluded that six weeks of PS supplementation shows a statistically not significant tendency (p = 0.07) to improve perceived stress levels in golfers and significantly improves (p < 0.05) the number of good ball flights during tee-off which might result in improved golf scores.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000868","authors":["J\u00e4ger, Ralf","Purpura, Martin","Geiss, Kurt-Reiner","Wei\u00df, Michael","Baumeister, Jochen","Amatulli, Francesco","Schr\u00f6der, Lars","Herwegen, Holger","Ralf J\u00e4ger","Martin Purpura","Kurt-Reiner Geiss","Michael Wei\u00df","Jochen Baumeister","Francesco Amatulli","Lars Schr\u00f6der","Holger Herwegen"],"doi":"10.1186\/1550-2783-4-23","first_seen_on":"2012-07-11T15:16:42+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1550-2783"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1408506328,"links":["http:\/\/www.jissn.com\/content\/4\/1\/23","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2217563\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1550-2783-4-23","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18053194","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2217563","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2217563\/?tool=pubmed","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2217563"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jissn.com\/content\/pdf\/1550-2783-4-23.pdf","pmcid":"PMC2217563","pmid":"18053194","pubdate":"2007-12-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nutrition","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Sports Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Nursing","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"23","title":"The effect of phosphatidylserine on golf performance","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/journal-international-society-sports-nutrition-7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":18.05,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":18.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8460119,"mean":7.1073763271304,"rank":493197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7966462,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8460119,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95624,"mean":5.9031120964622,"rank":5263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":90359,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95624,"percentile":94},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":547,"mean":40.783978021978,"rank":210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":337,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":547,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":38.5776,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2,"GB":1,"CA":1}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Zombieland","url":"http:\/\/evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com\/2010\/08\/zombieland.html","license":"public","citation_ids":[977986,835253,1369164,1213213,5100715,1213213],"posted_on":"2010-08-22T14:36:00+00:00","summary":"Back in the day, we ate a lot of brains.\u00a0 Stands to reason.\u00a0 All animals come with one, after all.\u00a0 And we certainly wouldn&#39;t leave behind such a great source of important fat.\u00a0\u00a0 Have you seen the movie Zombieland?\u00a0 I highly recommend it if you&#39;re","author":{"name":"Evolutionary Psychiatry","url":"http:\/\/evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com\/","description":""}}],"video":[{"title":"Phosphatidylserine as a Nootropic: A Stress Defeating Agent for a High Performance Memory","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MRT23GqOT1Q","image":"https:\/\/i1.ytimg.com\/vi\/MRT23GqOT1Q\/hqdefault.jpg","license":"public","citation_ids":[426486,1307025,921333,741919,2391357,835253,1944583,2391358,2391359],"posted_on":"2014-03-02T23:50:46+00:00","summary":"http:\/\/www.limitlessmindset.com\/nootropic-ingredients\/315-phosphatidylserine.html This amino acid is a potent combatant of stress, which lowers cortisol while at the same time supporting cognitive function and aiding memory.
