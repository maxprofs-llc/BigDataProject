However, after conventional analysis, no candidate mutation could be identified in the F8 of about 2% of haemophilia A patients. The F8 of a patient with mild congenital haemophilia A, in whom no candidate mutation was found in the exons or their flanking regions, was analysed in detail to identify the patient's aetiological genetic abnormality. We also characterized anti-FVIII antibody (inhibitor) development in this patient. Genomic DNA analysis revealed an adenine to guanine transition deep inside intron 10 (c.1478 + 325A>G) of F8 as a causative mutation. Analysis of the transcripts demonstrated that the majority of the patient's transcript was abnormal, with 226 bp of the intronic sequence inserted between exon 10 and 11. However, the analysis also indicated the existence of a small amount of normal transcript. Semi-quantification of ectopic F8 mRNA showed that about one-tenth of the normal mRNA level was present in the patient. After the use of a recombinant FVIII concentrate, the presence of an inhibitor was confirmed. The inhibitor was characterized as oligoclonal immunoglobulin IgG4 directed against both the A2 domain and light chain of the FVIII molecule with type I reaction kinetics of inhibition of FVIII activity. When no mutations are found by conventional analysis, deep intronic nucleotide substitutions may be responsible for mild haemophilia. The inhibitor development mechanism of the patient producing some normal FVIII was thought to be of interest.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029a1","authors":["Inaba, H.","Koyama, T.","Shinozawa, K.","Amano, K.","Fukutake, K."],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1365-2516.2012.02906.x","endpage":"105","first_seen_on":"2012-07-10T03:08:29+00:00","issns":["1365-2516","1351-8216"],"issue":"1","journal":"Haemophilia","last_mentioned_on":1341889670,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1365-2516.2012.02906.x\/abstract;jsessionid=508DE864A3EA0D0B02F970AA019C8671.d01t04"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1365-2516.2012.02906.x\/pdf","pmid":"22776136","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"100","subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Identification and characterization of an adenine to guanine transition within intron 10 of the factor VIII gene as a causative mutation in a patient with mild haemophilia A","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-characterization-adenine-guanine-transition-within-intron-10-factor-viii-gene-causati"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633986,"mean":4.9208287981427,"rank":2739692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":736438,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633986,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72566,"mean":4.7353158960931,"rank":47923,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":19455,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72566,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267,"mean":0.93458646616541,"rank":97,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Other":3,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2,"Mathematics":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/eepao_gr\/statuses\/222527521806229504","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[830010],"posted_on":"2012-07-10T03:07:50+00:00","author":{"name":"\u0395\u0395\u03a0\u0391\u039f","url":"http:\/\/www.eepao.gr","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1186574697\/eepao_normal.jpg","description":"\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0395\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03a0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u0391\u03b9\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u039f\u03b3\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2","id_on_source":"eepao_gr","tweeter_id":"224726312","geo":{"lt":37.97945,"ln":23.71622,"country":"GR"},"followers":27},"tweet_id":"222527521806229504"}]}}
