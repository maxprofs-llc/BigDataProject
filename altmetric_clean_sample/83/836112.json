X-ray nanotomography requires that samples are sufficiently thin for X-rays to pass through the sample during rotation for tomography. One method for producing samples that fit the criteria for X-ray nanotomography is focused ion beam\/scanning electron microscopy (FIB\/SEM) which uses a focused beam of ions to selectively mill around a region of interest and then utilizes a micromanipulator to remove the milled-out sample from the bulk material and mount it on a sample holder. In this article the process for preparing X-ray nanotomography samples in multiple shapes and sizes is discussed. Additionally, solid-oxide fuel cell anode samples prepared through the FIB\/SEM technique underwent volume-independence studies for multiple properties such as volume fraction, average particle size, tortuosity and contiguity to observe the characteristics of FIB\/SEM samples in X-ray nanotomography.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f4b","authors":["Chiu, W.K.S."],"doi":"10.1107\/s0909049512027252","first_seen_on":"2012-07-12T02:59:11+00:00","issns":["0909-0495"],"journal":"Journal of Synchrotron Radiation (International Union of Crystallography - IUCr)","last_mentioned_on":1342061337,"links":["http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper_yard?pp5019&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.iucr.org\/s\/issues\/2012\/05\/00\/pp5019\/pp5019.pdf","pmid":"22898959","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"International Union of Crystallography","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Optical Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
