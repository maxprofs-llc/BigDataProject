A remarkable feature is the spontaneous formation of the formate ion as a result of the methanol or methoxide oxidation in compounds 1 and 3. Using ethanol precludes the formation of the formate and compound 4 is obtained. The molecular structure of all compounds is stabilized by supramolecular interactions, including strong hydrogen bonding and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Marta Viciano-Chumillas","M\u00c3\u00b3nica Gim\u00c3\u00a9nez-Marqu\u00c3\u00a9s","Stefania Tanase","Ilpo Mutikainen","Urho Turpeinen","Jan M.
