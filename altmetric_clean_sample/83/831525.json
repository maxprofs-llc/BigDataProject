The aims of this study were to explore the existence of ADHD-like symptoms and\/or diagnosis in a sample of internationally adopted children depending on their country of origin and to describe the links that may exist between the display of these symptoms and observed narrative-based attachment patterns. A Catalan sample of 58 adopted children aged 7-8 (24 from Eastern Europe, 23 from China, and 11 from Ethiopia) was assessed with the Behavioral Assessment System for Children to identify ADHD-like symptoms, and the Friends and Family Interview to identify children's' attachment patterns. Results indicated that children adopted from Eastern Europe showed a trend toward more hyperactivity and significantly more attention problems than girls adopted from China. Children with a secure attachment showed significantly less attention problems and a trend toward less hyperactivity. More studies focusing on the etiology and treatment of these symptoms in adopted children are needed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4da3cf058f6100015f6","authors":["Abrines N","Barcons N","Marre D","Brun C","Fornieles A","Fumad\u00f3 V"],"doi":"10.1080\/14616734.2012.691656","first_seen_on":"2012-07-10T20:16:49+00:00","issns":["1461-6734"],"issue":"4","journal":"Attachment &amp; Human Development","last_mentioned_on":1341951371,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22697472"],"pmid":"22697472","pubdate":"2012-06-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences"],"title":"ADHD-like symptoms and attachment in internationally adopted children.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adhdlike-symptoms-attachment-internationally-adopted-children"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506762,"mean":5.1233691071599,"rank":2124560,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2212335,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506762,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75489,"mean":5.0832077416278,"rank":31176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":40903,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75489,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125,"mean":2.1313548387097,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":68,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.78333333333333,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
