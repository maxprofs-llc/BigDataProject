In vitro electrostimulation of non-stem and stem cells induces myogenic predifferentiation and may be a powerful tool to generate cells with the capacity to respond to local areas of injury. We evaluated the effects of in vivo electrostimulation on infarcted myocardium using a miniaturized multiparameter implantable stimulator in rats. Parameters of electrostimulation were organized to avoid a direct driving or pacing of native heart rhythm. Electrical stimuli were delivered for 14 days across the scar site. In situ electrostimulation used as a cell-free, cytokine-free stimulation system, improved myocardial function, and increased angiogenesis through endothelial progenitor cell migration and production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In situ electrostimulation represents a novel means to stimulate repair of the heart and other organs, as well as to precondition tissues for treatment with cell-based therapies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e22","doi":"10.3727\/096368912x652977","first_seen_on":"2012-07-11T12:38:05+00:00","issns":["1555-3892"],"journal":"Cell Transplantation","last_mentioned_on":1408049643,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22776240?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ingentaconnect.com\/content\/cog\/ct\/2013\/00000022\/00000003\/art00010?crawler=true&mimetype=application%2Fpdf"],"pmid":"22776240","pubdate":"2012-07-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"IN SITU ELECTROSTIMULATION DRIVES A REGENERATIVE SHIFT IN THE ZONE OF INFARCTED MYOCARDIUM.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/situ-electrostimulation-drives-regenerative-shift-zone-infarcted-myocardium"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":2496367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2389124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77785,"mean":5.4064774503754,"rank":33817,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":41340,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77785,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":433,"mean":9.7158055555556,"rank":186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":433,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.3506,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
