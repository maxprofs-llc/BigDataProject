To better characterize the prevalence of these pathogens, EPA Method 1623 was developed and used to monitor levels of these organisms in US drinking water supplies (12). The method has three main parts; the first is the sample concentration in which at least 10 L of raw surface water is filtered. The organisms and trapped debris are then eluted from the filter and centrifuged to further concentrate the sample. The second part of the method uses an immunomagnetic separation procedure where the concentrated water sample is applied to immunomagnetic beads that specifically bind to the Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts allowing for specific removal of the parasites from the concentrated debris. These (oo)cysts are then detached from the magnetic beads by an acid dissociation procedure. The final part of the method is the immunofluorescence staining and enumeration where (oo)cysts are applied to a slide, stained, and enumerated by microscopy. Method 1623 has four listed sample concentration systems to capture Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts in water: Envirochek filters (Pall Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI), Envirochek HV filters (Pall Corporation), Filta-Max filters (IDEXX, Westbrook, MA), or Continuous Flow Centrifugation (Haemonetics, Braintree, MA). However, Cryptosporidium and Giardia (oo)cyst recoveries have varied greatly depending on the source water matrix and filters used(1,14). A new tangential flow hollow-fiber ultrafiltration (HFUF) system has recently been shown to be more efficient and more robust at recovering Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts from various water matrices; moreover, it is less expensive than other capsule filter options and can concentrate multiple pathogens simultaneously(1-3,5-8,10,11). In addition, previous studies by Hill and colleagues demonstrated that the HFUF significantly improved Cryptosporidium oocysts recoveries when directly compared with the Envirochek HV filters(4). Additional modifications to the current methods have also been reported to improve method performance. Replacing the acid dissociation procedure with heat dissociation was shown to be more effective at separating Cryptosporidium from the magnetic beads in some matrices(9,13) . This protocol describes a modified Method 1623 that uses the new HFUF filtration system with the heat dissociation step. The use of HFUF with this modified Method is a less expensive alternative to current EPA Method 1623 filtration options and provides more flexibility by allowing the concentration of multiple organisms.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f23","doi":"10.3791\/4177","first_seen_on":"2012-07-10T16:43:00+00:00","issns":["1940-087X"],"journal":"Journal of Visualized Experiments","last_mentioned_on":1393534826,"links":["http:\/\/www.jove.com\/video\/4177\/a-modified-epa-method-1623-that-uses-tangential-flow-hollow-fiber-ultrafiltration-and-heat-dissociation-steps-to-detect-waterborne-cryptosporidium-and-giardia-spp","http:\/\/www.jove.com\/video\/4177\/a-modified-epa-method-1623-that-uses-tangential-flow-hollow-fiber?utm_source=social&utm_medium=cta&utm_content=4177twt2&utm_campaign=twt2","http:\/\/www.jove.com\/video\/4177?utm_source=youtube"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jove.com\/pdf\/4177","pmid":"22805201","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"JoVE","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques","biology"],"title":"A Modified EPA Method 1623 that Uses Tangential Flow Hollow-fiber Ultrafiltration and Heat Dissociation Steps to Detect Waterborne Cryptosporidium and Giardia spp.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/modified-epa-method-1623-uses-tangential-flow-hollowfiber-ultrafiltration-heat-dissociation-steps-de"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.45,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6228993,"mean":5.9654070340771,"rank":2176508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4046086,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6228993,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81540,"mean":5.5560377242791,"rank":25717,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":55696,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81540,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3675,"mean":3.0162716385411,"rank":890,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":2782,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3675,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":8.3357142857143,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
