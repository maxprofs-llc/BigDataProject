Exposure of Barrett's epithelium to bile acids is a major stimulant for goblet cell formation. The dissociation of bile acids into forms that penetrate Barrett's epithelium is known to be pH dependent. We hypothesized that variations in the esophageal luminal pH environment explains the variability in goblet cell density. The aim of this study was to correlate esophageal luminal pH with goblet cell density in patients with BE.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002db8","authors":["Theodorou D","Ayazi S","Demeester SR","Zehetner J","Peyre CG","Grant KS","Augustin F","Oh DS","Lipham JC","Chandrasoma PT","Hagen JA","Demeester TR"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11605-011-1776-3","first_seen_on":"2012-07-11T10:05:49+00:00","issns":["1091-255X"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1342001101,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22095525?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22095525","pubdate":"2011-11-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Gastroenterology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","gastroenterology"],"title":"Intraluminal pH and Goblet Cell Density in Barrett's Esophagus.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intraluminal-ph-goblet-cell-density-barretts-esophagus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627464,"mean":4.9483847763613,"rank":2906235,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":74103,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627464,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72419,"mean":4.7761321218481,"rank":53412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":253,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72419,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":508,"mean":1.5103037475345,"rank":307,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":508,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":0.68448275862069,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
