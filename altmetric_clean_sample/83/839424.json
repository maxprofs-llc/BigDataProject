Hemoglobin Removal"],"citation":{"abstract":"The association between transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21)-509 C>T and risk of digestive tract cancer (DTC) remained uncertain as previous studies reported conflicting results. The aim of this study was to assess the association by using a meta-analysis. The databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE and WANGFANG (Chinese database) were retrieved, and latest update was on 2nd February, 2012. Pooled odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (OR and 95% CI) were calculated by using a fixed- or random-effect model. Ultimately, twenty nine case-control studies with 8664 cases and 12,532 controls were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, there was no association between TGF-\u03b21-509 C>T and risk of DTC in all genetic comparison models (OR and 95% CI: 0.96 and 0.81-1.15 for TT vs. CC, 0.98 and 0.91-1.05 for T carriers vs. C carriers). When subgroup analyses were conducted according to ethnicity, types of cancer and sample size, T allele was significantly associated with decreased risk of DTC for Caucasians and for large sample-sized studies, and was associated with decreased risk of colorectal cancer (OR and 95% CI for TT vs. CC: 0.82 and 0.70-0.97 for Caucasians, 0.80 and 0.68-0.98 for large sample-sized studies, 0.78 and 0.62-0.97 for colorectal cancer). This study indicated that TGF-\u03b21-509 C>T polymorphism was probably associated with risk of DTC, especially for Caucasians. Because of modest limitation, our findings should be confirmed by future studies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002932","authors":["Zhang JM","Cui XJ","Xia YQ","Guo S"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.gene.2012.05.046","first_seen_on":"2012-07-13T22:38:35+00:00","issns":["0378-1119","03781119"],"journal":"Gene","last_mentioned_on":1342219060,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S037811191200652X"],"pmid":"22677269","pubdate":"2012-06-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Correlation between TGF-\u03b21-509 C>T polymorphism and risk of digestive tract cancer in a meta-analysis for 21,196 participants ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/correlation-between-tgf%CE%B21509-ct-polymorphism-risk-digestive-tract-cancer-metaanalysis-21196-particip"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":3082249,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":964603,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75459,"mean":5.1276133213178,"rank":48654,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":16105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75459,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3991,"mean":2.0522721804511,"rank":2611,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":1093,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3991,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":1.1337333333333,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Swapan_Roy\/statuses\/223909085542744064","license":"public","citation_ids":[839424],"posted_on":"2012-07-13T22:37:40+00:00","author":{"name":"BiotechSupportGroup","url":"http:\/\/www.biotechsupportgroup.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1087771726\/basic_.B.logo_normal.jpg","description":"Established in 1995, Biotech Support Group is a New Jersey based company which produces licensed and proprietary products for genomics and proteomics research.","id_on_source":"Swapan_Roy","tweeter_id":"171070840","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":125},"tweet_id":"223909085542744064"}]}}
