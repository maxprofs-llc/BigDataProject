Policy statements recommend that women be given detailed information about the risks of various outcomes, including death, long-term disability and various specific neonatal problems. Both personal narratives and studies suggest that parents also base their decisions on factors other than the probabilistic facts about expected outcomes. Statistics are difficult to understand at any time. Rational decision-making may be difficult when taking life-and-death decisions. Furthermore, the role of emotions is not discussed in peri-viability guidelines.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f61000215f","authors":["Janvier, Annie","Lorenz, John M","Lantos, John D"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1651-2227.2012.02695.x","endpage":"804","first_seen_on":"2012-07-13T19:58:42+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1651-2227","0803-5253"],"issue":"8","journal":"Acta Paediatrica","last_mentioned_on":1344709382,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1651-2227.2012.02695.x\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1651-2227.2012.02695.x\/pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1651-2227.2012.02695.x\/pdf","pmid":"22497312","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"800","subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Antenatal counselling for parents facing an extremely preterm birth: limitations of the medical evidence","type":"article","volume":"101","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antenatal-counselling-parents-facing-extremely-preterm-birth-limitations-medical-evidence"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506762,"mean":5.1233691071599,"rank":1879368,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":2571458,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506762,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75458,"mean":5.1179862173158,"rank":25771,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":48636,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75458,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1429,"mean":3.3737577030812,"rank":610,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":795,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1429,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.2916666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
