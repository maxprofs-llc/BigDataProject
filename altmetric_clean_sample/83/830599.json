Four of eleven criteria (M-protein, VEGF, endocrinopathy and thrombocytosis\/polycythemia) are closely associated with clinical laboratory testing. POEMS has been largely associated with \u03bb-M-gammopathies. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a recent addition to the major diagnostic criteria. VEGF may alter vascular permeability causing some manifestations of POEMS.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002542","doi":"10.1016\/j.cca.2012.06.032","first_seen_on":"2012-07-10T11:38:36+00:00","issns":["1873-3492"],"journal":"Clinica Chimica Acta","last_mentioned_on":1341920277,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22771968?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22771968","pubdate":"2012-07-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistryclinical"],"title":"POEMS syndrome: Importance of the Clinical Laboratory Practitioner's Role.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/poems-syndrome-importance-clinical-laboratory-practitioners-role"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":4207082,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77893,"mean":5.4021690032353,"rank":64568,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77893,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":829,"mean":2.2918574879227,"rank":636,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":829,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":5.3144615384615,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/VEGFRSSfeeds\/statuses\/222655896294141953","license":"public","citation_ids":[830599],"posted_on":"2012-07-10T11:37:57+00:00","author":{"name":"VEGF RSS Feeds","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/516588600\/VEGF_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"VEGFRSSfeeds","tweeter_id":"88511740","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":363},"tweet_id":"222655896294141953"}]}}
