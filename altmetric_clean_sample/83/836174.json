Data were collected using observations, natural interviews, and in-depth interviews with 35 older people, concurrently analyzed using thematic analysis. Preparation for aging, from their perspectives, consisted of attending to their physical health, spiritual well-being, and preparing for death. The degree and quality of aging preparation was influenced by life events, personal health status, and family economic status. People actively prepare themselves for aging, and this appears to help them as they encounter life difficulties during their old age. Lifelong preparation strategies need to be studied further, so that locally-appropriate strategies of health care can be implemented for older people.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5103cf058f610003203","authors":["Rattanamongkolgul, Duangduan","Sritanyarat, Wanapa","Manderson, Lenore","Rattanamongkolgul D","Sritanyarat W","Manderson L"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1442-2018.2012.00698.x","endpage":"451","first_seen_on":"2012-07-12T04:09:10+00:00","issns":["1442-2018","1441-0745"],"issue":"4","journal":"Nursing & Health Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1342065540,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111%2Fj.1442-2018.2012.00698.x"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1442-2018.2012.00698.x\/pdf","pmid":"22780902","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Asia","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"446","subjects":["nursing"],"title":"Preparing for aging among older villagers in northeastern Thailand","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/preparing-aging-among-older-villagers-northeastern-thailand"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6393028,"mean":5.8562476592076,"rank":4723906,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":946272,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6393028,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81156,"mean":5.5439472614133,"rank":53514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":14411,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81156,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":318,"mean":1.458927444795,"rank":139,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":318,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
