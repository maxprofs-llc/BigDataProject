However, despite significant effort, there are still no approved therapeutic mAbs directed against the largest and most attractive family of drug targets: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs regulate essentially all cellular processes, including those that are fundamental to cancer pathology, such as proliferation, survival\/drug resistance, migration, differentiation, tissue invasion, and angiogenesis. Many different GPCR isoforms are enhanced or dysregulated in multiple tumor types, and several GPCRs have known oncogenic activity. With approximately 350 distinct GPCRs in the genome, these receptors provide a rich landscape for the design of effective, targeted therapies for cancer, a uniquely heterogeneous disease family. While the generation of selective, efficacious mAbs has been problematic for these structurally complex integral membrane proteins, progress in the development of immunotherapeutics has been made by several independent groups. This chapter provides an overview of the roles of GPCRs in cancer and describes the current state of the art of GPCR-targeted mAb drugs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9193cf058f61000d2b3","authors":["Herr DR"],"doi":"10.1016\/b978-0-12-394308-8.00002-9","first_seen_on":"2012-07-13T08:46:00+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1937-6448","19376448"],"journal":"International review of cell and molecular biology","last_mentioned_on":1342169913,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/B9780123943088000029"],"pmid":"22608557","pubdate":"2012-05-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"Chapter Two Potential Use of G Protein-Coupled Receptor-Blocking Monoclonal Antibodies as Therapeutic Agents for Cancers ","type":"article","volume":"297","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/potential-g-proteincoupled-receptorblocking-monoclonal-antibodies-therapeutic-agents-cancers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6560926,"mean":6.0783135390207,"rank":3117044,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1959304,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6560926,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83243,"mean":5.5996483986449,"rank":39450,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":32296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83243,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148,"mean":1.7155918367347,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":72,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.0625,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Ph.
