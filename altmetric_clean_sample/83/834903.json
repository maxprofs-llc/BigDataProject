Because little research has been focused on refractory\/relapsed (R\/R) cases, we conducted a retrospective analysis for R\/R ML-DS. Among ML-DS patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2010 in Japan, 26 relapsed (25 in the BM and 1 in the skin), and 3 refractory patients were enrolled. The male\/female ratio was 18\/11. The median age at initial diagnosis of ML-DS was 2 years, and the median time to relapse was 8.6 months. Each patient initially had been treated with ML-DS-specific protocols. Thirteen of the 26 patients achieved complete remission with various kinds of reinduction chemotherapies; 2 of 8 survived without further recurrence after receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and 4 of 5 maintained complete remissions with chemotherapy alone. Treatment failures mostly were associated with disease progression rather than treatment-related toxicities. The 3-year OS rate was 25.9% \u00b1 8.5%. A longer duration from initial diagnosis to relapse was a significant favorable prognostic factor (P < .0001). We conclude that clinical outcome for patients with R\/R ML-DS generally are unfavorable, even in those receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Novel methods to identify poor prognostic factors for ML-DS are necessary.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cba","doi":"10.1182\/blood-2012-03-414755","first_seen_on":"2012-07-11T12:27:17+00:00","issns":["1528-0020"],"journal":"Blood","last_mentioned_on":1346778009,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22776818?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"22776818","pubdate":"2012-07-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Clinical characteristics and outcome of refractory\/relapsed myeloid leukemia in children with Down syndrome.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-characteristics-outcome-refractoryrelapsed-myeloid-leukemia-children-down-syndrome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2304937,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1594010,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75380,"mean":5.1464952572998,"rank":34982,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":30118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75380,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7808,"mean":2.91063507109,"rank":4060,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":2105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7808,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":2.525908045977,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
