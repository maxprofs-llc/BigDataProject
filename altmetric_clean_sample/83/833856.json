One interpretation of this finding is that negation requires two steps to process: first represent what is being negated then \"reject\" that in favour of a representation of a negation-consistent state of affairs (Kaup et al., 2007). In this paper we argue that this finding with negative sentences could be a by-product of the dynamic way that language is interpreted relative to a common ground and not the way that negation is represented. We present a study based on Kaup et al. (2007) that tests the competing accounts. Our results suggest that some negative sentences are not processed in two steps, but provide support for the alternative, dynamic account.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f610001433","authors":[" Ye   Tian ","Tian Y","Breheny R","Ferguson HJ"],"doi":"10.1080\/17470218.2010.525712","endpage":"2312","first_seen_on":"2012-07-11T05:45:00+00:00","issns":["1747-0218"],"issue":"12","journal":"The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1361929641,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/17470218.2010.525712"],"pmid":"21058217","pubdate":"2010-11-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Routledge Journals","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"2305","subjects":["psychophysiology","psychology"],"title":"Why we simulate negated information: A dynamic pragmatic account","type":"article","volume":"63","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/we-simulate-negated-information-dynamic-pragmatic-account"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6337581,"mean":5.8312693693813,"rank":4447042,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1656523,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6337581,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80508,"mean":5.5566727116896,"rank":49429,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":27462,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80508,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":573,"mean":11.204101398601,"rank":425,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":573,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":30.54775,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
