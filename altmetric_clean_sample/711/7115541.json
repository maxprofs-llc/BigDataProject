For this purpose a novel kidney-specific drug carrier was developed. The peptide sequence (KKEEE)3K showed high renal specificity and rapid kidney accumulation. Micro-PET imaging studies of megalin-deficient mice indicate that the cellular endocytosis of (KKEEE)3K is mediated by megalin. This assumption is supported by immunohistochemistry analysis of FITC-labeled carrier peptide, which exclusively accumulated at the apical site of proximal tubule cells within the renal cortex. Scinti-graphic studies of modified ciprofloxacin conjugated to (KKEEE)3K furthermore showed that the described peptide-carrier could be utilized to actively target drugs to proximal tubular cells. In conclusion, these results suggest the potential of (KKEEE)3K as a promising candidate for kidney-targeted drug delivery.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c4a","authors":["Artjom Wischnjow","Dikran Sarko","Maria Janzer","Christina Kaufman","Barbro Beijer","Sebastian Brings","Uwe Haberkorn","Gregor Larbig","Armin K\u00fcbelbeck","Walter Mier"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.bioconjchem.6b00057","endpage":"1057","first_seen_on":"2016-05-02T18:08:04+00:00","issns":["1520-4812","1043-1802"],"issue":"4","journal":"Bioconjugate Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1462212335,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/pdfplus\/10.1021\/acs.bioconjchem.6b00057","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/acs.bioconjchem.6b00057"],"pmid":"26999755","pubdate":"2016-04-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1050","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Renal Targeting: Peptide-Based Drug Delivery to Proximal Tubule Cells","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.bioconjchem.6b00057","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/renal-targeting-peptidebased-drug-delivery-proximal-tubule-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7639268,"mean":6.5692022176954,"rank":5506302,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1860628,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7639268,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266310,"mean":11.378798756332,"rank":171236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":79750,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266310,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":744,"mean":2.4159004037685,"rank":451,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":220,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":744,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":1.5677419354839,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
