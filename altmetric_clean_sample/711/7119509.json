Assignment of most of the resonance lines in (13) C, (15) N and (29) Si cross-polarization magic-angle-spinning NMR spectra were suggested. A comparative analysis of (13) C isotropic chemical shifts of polyamides with and without ferrocene has revealed a systematic shift towards higher \u03b4 -values (de-shielding) explained as the incorporation of paramagnetic ferrocene into the polyamide backbone. In addition, the (13) C NMR resonance lines for ferrocene-based polyamide were significantly broadened, because of paramagnetic effects from ferrocene incorporated in the structure of this polyamide polymer. Single resonance lines with chemical shifts ranging from 88.1 to 91.5\u2009ppm were observed for (15) N sites in all of studied polyamide samples. (29) Si chemical shifts were found to be around -22.4\u2009ppm in polydimethylsiloxane samples that falls in the range of chemical shifts for alkylsiloxane compounds. The CO2 capture performance of polyamide-dimethylsiloxane-based block copolymers was measured as a function of temperature and pressure. The data revealed that these polymeric materials have potential to uptake CO2 (up to 9.6\u2009cm(3) \u2009g(-1) ) at ambient pressures and in the temperature interval 30-40\u2009\u00b0C.
