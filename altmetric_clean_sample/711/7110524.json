Notably, based on a palladium triggered terminal allyl ether cleavage reaction, the probe could detect and discriminate Pd(0) and Pd(2+)\/Pd(4+) in about 2.5 min at room temperature with a low detection limit (0.29 ppb) and significant colour change (from light yellow to pink). The probe could serve as an excellent \"naked-eye\" colorimetric probe for selective and quantitative determination of palladium in aqueous solutions. Moreover, it could be used as a two-photon palladium probe for in vitro\/vivo and three-dimensional imaging with low cytotoxicity and autofluorescence.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Weifang Luo","Wei-Sheng Liu","Weisheng Liu"],"doi":"10.1039\/c6dt00800c","endpage":"11687","first_seen_on":"2016-05-02T09:38:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1477-9234"],"issue":"29","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1468954784,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2016\/DT\/C6DT00800C?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=inorganicnews"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2016\/dt\/c6dt00800c","pmid":"27181987","pubdate":"2016-05-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"11682","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"A Water-Soluble Colorimetric Two-Photon Probe for Discrimination of Different Palladium Species and Its Application in Bioimaging","type":"article","volume":"45","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/watersoluble-colorimetric-twophoton-probe-discrimination-different-palladium-species-application-bio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8088896,"mean":6.8703833603893,"rank":7002071,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8088896,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269503,"mean":11.506075561591,"rank":225234,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269503,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11126,"mean":0.69662759550562,"rank":3162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11126,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":457,"mean":0.78385526315789,"rank":145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":457,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Materials Science":1,"Chemistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/InorganicNews\/statuses\/727069655626473472","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7110524],"posted_on":"2016-05-02T09:38:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Inorganic News","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1636129253\/DSC01061_2_normal.JPG","description":"News, comments and publications about Inorganic Chemistry.","id_on_source":"InorganicNews","tweeter_id":"411132501","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1297},"tweet_id":"727069655626473472"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/InorganicNews\/statuses\/755477239957819392","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7110524],"posted_on":"2016-07-19T18:59:44+00:00","author":{"name":"Inorganic News","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1636129253\/DSC01061_2_normal.JPG","description":"News, comments and publications about Inorganic Chemistry.","id_on_source":"InorganicNews","tweeter_id":"411132501","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1297},"tweet_id":"755477239957819392"}]}}
