Strategic planning to fund research would raise"],"citation":{"abstract":"Several Gram-positive pathogens scavenge host-derived heme to satisfy their nutritional iron requirement. However, heme is a toxic molecule capable of damaging the bacterial cell. Gram-positive pathogens within the phylum Firmicutes overcome heme toxicity by sensing heme through HssRS, a two-component system that regulates the heme detoxification transporter HrtAB. Here we show that heme sensing by HssRS and heme detoxification by HrtAB occur in the insect pathogenBacillus thuringiensis We find that inBacillus thuringiensis, HssRS directly regulates an operon,hrmXY, encoding hypothetical membrane proteins that are not found in other Firmicutes with characterized HssRS and HrtAB systems. This novel HssRS-regulated operon or its orthologuesBMB171_c3178andBMB171_c3330are required for maximal heme resistance. Furthermore, the activity of HrmXY is not dependent on expression of HrtAB. These results suggest thatBacillus thuringiensissenses heme through HssRS and induces expression of separate membrane-localized systems capable of overcoming different aspects of heme toxicity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028c4","authors":["Rachel M.
