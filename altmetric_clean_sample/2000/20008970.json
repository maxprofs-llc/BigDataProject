Breastfeeding is generally recommended for mothers of infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) unless some associated risk outweighs the benefits. Evidence indicates that infants with NAS who receive human milk require less pharmacologic treatment and have shorter hospital lengths of stay. Perhaps the greatest barrier to breastfeeding for women with opioid dependence is the inaccurate and inconsistent information they receive from different sources, including health care professionals. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Academy of Pediatrics, and Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine (ABM) have published statements that support breastfeeding infants with NAS. The ABM has a dedicated protocol to guide clinicians in deciding which mothers should and which mothers should not breastfeed their babies. In this review, studies evaluating the effects of breastfeeding, professional organizations' protocols and recommendations regarding breastfeeding, and barriers to breastfeeding infants with NAS are discussed, as well as the dangers of illicit drug exposure and avoiding rebound NAS in a breastfed baby. Clinicians can play an important role in in identifying, supporting, counseling, and advocating for mothers who wish to breastfeed their infant with NAS. This article is protected by copyright.
