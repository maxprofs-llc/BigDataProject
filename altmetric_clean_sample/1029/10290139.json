Insulin resistance (IR) is a prominent pathophysiologic component in a myriad of metabolic disorders, including obesity, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which are common in our locality. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of IR and factors associated with this condition in an adult population from Maracaibo city, Venezuela. Methodology. A cross-sectional, descriptive study with multistaged randomized sampling was carried out in 2026 adults. IR was defined as HOMA2-IR \u2265 2. A multiple logistic regression model was constructed in order to evaluate factors associated with IR. Results. The prevalence of IR was 46.5% (n = 943), with 46.7% (n = 450) in the general population, 46.4% (n = 493) in females, and 47.90% (n = 970) in males (p = 0.895). IR prevalence tended to increase with age and was significantly greater in subjects aged \u226530 years (\u03c7 (2) = 16.726; p = 2.33 \u00d7 10(-4)). Employment, alcohol consumption, obesity, high triacylglycerides, low HDL-C, and dysglycemia were associated with greater odds of IR, whereas a high level of physical activity appeared to be weak protective factor against IR. Conclusions. The prevalence of IR is elevated in our locality. The main determinants of this condition appear to be the presence of obesity, high triacylglycerides, low HDL-C, dysglycemia, and alcohol intake.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f6100068cd","authors":["Bermudez, Valmore","Valmore Bermudez","Juan Salazar","Mar\u00eda Sof\u00eda Mart\u00ednez","Mervin Ch\u00e1vez-Castillo","Luis Carlos Olivar","Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Calvo","Jim Palmar","Jordan Bautista","Eduardo Ramos","Mayela Cabrera","Freddy Pachano","Joselyn Rojas"],"doi":"10.1155\/2016\/9405105","endpage":"13","first_seen_on":"2016-08-05T22:23:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2090-3480","2090-3499"],"journal":"Advances in Preventive Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1472852644,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/apm\/2016\/9405105\/","https:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/apm\/2016\/9405105\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4989131\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/apm\/2016\/9405105.pdf","pmid":"27579182","pubdate":"2016-08-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","startpage":"1","title":"Prevalence and Associated Factors of Insulin Resistance in Adults from Maracaibo City, Venezuela","type":"article","volume":"2016","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-associated-factors-insulin-resistance-adults-maracaibo-city-venezuela"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317445,"mean":7.0084957256017,"rank":3502365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4762180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317445,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258841,"mean":11.982175235666,"rank":99186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":156954,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258841,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":8.9445245901639,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
