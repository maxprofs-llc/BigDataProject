However, population-derived prevalence data on challenge-confirmed food allergy and other allergic diseases in preschool-aged children remain sparse.\nThis study aimed to report the updated prevalence of food allergy at age 1\u00a0year from the whole cohort, and to report the prevalence of food allergy, asthma, eczema, and allergic rhinitis at age 4\u00a0years.\nHealthNuts is a population-based cohort study with baseline recruitment of 5276 one-year-old children who underwent skin prick test (SPT) to 4 food allergens and those with detectable SPT results had formal food challenges. At age 4\u00a0years, parents completed a questionnaire (81.3% completed) and those who previously attended the HealthNuts clinic at age 1\u00a0year or reported symptoms of a new food allergy were invited for an assessment that included SPT and oral food challenges. Data on asthma, eczema, and allergic rhinitis were captured by validated International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaires.\nThe prevalence of challenge-confirmed food allergy at age 1 and 4\u00a0years was 11.0% and 3.8%, respectively. At age 4\u00a0years, peanut allergy prevalence was 1.9% (95% CI, 1.6% to 2.3%), egg allergy was 1.2% (95% CI, 0.9% to 1.6%), and sesame allergy was 0.4% (95% CI, 0.3% to 0.6%). Late-onset peanut allergy at age 4\u00a0years was rare (0.2%). The prevalence of current asthma was 10.8% (95% CI, 9.7% to 12.1%), current eczema was 16.0% (95% CI, 14.7% to 17.4%), and current allergic rhinitis was 8.3% (95% CI, 7.2% to 9.4%). Forty percent to 50% of this population-based cohort experienced symptoms of an allergic disease in the first 4\u00a0years of their life.\nAlthough the prevalence of food allergy decreased between age 1\u00a0year and age 4\u00a0years in this population-based cohort, the prevalence of any allergic disease among 4-year-old children in Melbourne, Australia, is remarkably high.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b59","authors":["Peters, Rachel L.","Koplin, Jennifer J.","Gurrin, Lyle C.","Dharmage, Shyamali C.","Wake, Melissa","Ponsonby, Anne-Louise","Tang, Mimi L.K.","Lowe, Adrian J.","Matheson, Melanie","Dwyer, Terence","Allen, Katrina J.","Rachel L.
