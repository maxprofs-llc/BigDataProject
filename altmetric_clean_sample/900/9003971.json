The serovars Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Typhimurium are most frequently associated with foodborne illness in Europe. Whilst control programmes exist to monitor these serovars in the chicken and turkey sectors, no regulatory programme is currently in place for the duck sector. A voluntary industry scheme (Duck Assurance Scheme) was launched in the UK in 2010. Hatcheries act as focal points of Salmonella contamination, in particular if Salmonella-contaminated eggs from positive breeding farms enter the hatchery. Five duck hatcheries were visited in this study and four were positive for Salmonella. S. Typhimurium DT8 and S. Indiana were isolated from hatchery 1 and S. Typhimurium DT41 and S. Senftenberg were isolated from hatchery 3. S. Kottbus, S. Bovismorbificans and S. Senftenberg were isolated from hatchery 2 and S. Kedougou was isolated from hatchery 4. Advice on the control\/elimination of Salmonella was provided at each visit and a longitudinal study was undertaken to monitor its effectiveness. Extensive sampling was carried out in the hatcheries visited and the tray wash area and waste\/external areas had the highest probability of being contaminated. The hatcher area was also found to be a primary focus of contamination. Improvements of farm and hatchery biosecurity standards have resulted in a reduction of hatchery contamination in this study and in previous investigations. Hatcheries 1 and 5 were cleared of Salmonella, demonstrating that elimination of Salmonella contamination from duck hatcheries is achievable.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d63cf058f61000115a","authors":["Martelli, F","Birch, C","Davies, R H"],"doi":"10.1080\/03079457.2016.1146820","endpage":"266","first_seen_on":"2016-06-24T02:44:22+00:00","issns":["1465-3338","0307-9457"],"issue":"2","journal":"Avian Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1464856520,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1080\/03079457.2016.1146820"],"pmid":"27100154","pubdate":"2016-04-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"261","title":"\n              Observations on the distribution and control of\n              Salmonella\n              in commercial duck hatcheries in the UK\n            ","type":"article","volume":"45","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/observations-distribution-control-salmonella-commercial-duck-hatcheries-uk"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7847043,"mean":6.6493042501824,"rank":1926370,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4837390,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7847043,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261129,"mean":11.532131843387,"rank":83117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":174276,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261129,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":305,"mean":2.0918881578947,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":305,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.3419047619048,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"policy":[{"title":"Papers published by APHA in May 2016","url":"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/527148\/pub-scientific0516.pdf","license":"public","citation_ids":[7116306,6978955,9003971,9003972,6039429,9003975,5022405,9003966,9003968,6693628,9003977,6726522,6916951,5022405],"posted_on":"2016-06-02T08:35:20+00:00","source":{"name":"UK Government (GOV.UK)","description":"GOV.UK is a central website that covers all UK government departments, as well as many other agencies and public bodies.
