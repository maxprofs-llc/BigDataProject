The exercise program lasted 48 sessions and dropout was defined as attendance of 50% of sessions or less. Logistic binominal regression was performed to assess the risk of dropout. For all analyses, a two-tailed P value of < 0.05 was used.\nThe total dropout rate was 38.6%. The Young-Old and Middle-Old groups showed lower dropouts compared to Non-Old patients (p = 0.01). Young-Old has 96% less risk for dropout compared to Non-Old group (adjusted odds ratios = 1.96 [1.16-3.29]). Furthermore, patients underwent the Coronary Artery Bypass Graft showed a lower rate of dropout (p = 0.001). The absence of CABG involved three times more risk of dropout (p = 0.001).\nThe Non-Old and the Middle-Old patients showed higher dropout rates compared to Young-Old. To ensure the best possible rehabilitation and to improve patients\u00b4 participation in CR, these programs should be adjusted to the needs of patients in terms of their age.","altmetric_jid":"55fc02242a83eeb25a8b456f","authors":["Nesello, Pietro Felice Tomazini","Tairova, Olga","Tairova, Maria","Graciolli, Lucas","Baroni, Allan","Comparsi, Eduardo","Marchi, Thiago De"],"doi":"10.3889\/oamjms.2016.125","first_seen_on":"2017-01-06T17:33:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1857-9655"],"issue":"4","journal":"Open Access Macedonian Journal of Medical Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1483724013,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28028408"],"pmcid":"PMC5175516","pmid":"28028408","pubdate":"2016-12-15T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"654","title":"Treatment of the Aged Patients at a Large Cardiac Rehabilitation Center in the Southern Brazil and Some Aspects of Their Dropout from the Therapeutic Programs","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/treatment-aged-patients-large-cardiac-rehabilitation-center-southern-brazil-some-aspects-dropout-the"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992937,"mean":6.7399601605663,"rank":4196948,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2232862,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992937,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253394,"mean":12.589266593789,"rank":142525,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":86376,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253394,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":1.3113636363636,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":64,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":2.39,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Sports and Recreations":1,"Psychology":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Philosophy":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"MX":1},"mendeley":{"MK":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/FtMonseCruz\/statuses\/817423876904914946","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15270636],"posted_on":"2017-01-06T17:33:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Monserrat Cruz","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/871237031506001920\/__xKFOOI_normal.jpg","description":"Fisioterapeuta en Rehabilitaci\u00f3n Cardiaca.
