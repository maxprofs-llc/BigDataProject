These conditions are often further subdivided into CIM, critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP), or the combination-critical illness polyneuromyopathy (CIPNM). In this review, we discuss the epidemiology and pathophysiology of CIM, CIP, and CIPNM, along with diagnostic considerations such as detailed clinical examination, electrophysiological studies, and histopathological review of muscle biopsy specimens. We also review current available treatments and prognosis. Increased awareness and early recognition of CIM, CIP, and CIPNM in the intensive care unit setting may lead to earlier treatments and rehabilitation, improving patient outcomes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008b2f","authors":["Starane Shepherd","Ayush Batra","David P.
