Our objective was to evaluate the impact of self-perceived barriers to healthcare on 1-year mortality among newly diagnosed HIV-infected individuals in Durban, South Africa.\nPrior to HIV testing at four outpatient sites, adults (\u226518y) were surveyed regarding perceived barriers to care including: 1) service delivery; 2) financial; 3) personal health perception; 4) logistical; and 5) structural. We assessed deaths via phone calls and the South African National Population Register. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to determine the association between number of perceived barriers and death within one year.\n1,899 HIV-infected participants enrolled. Median age was 33 years (IQR: 27-41y), 49% were female, and median CD4 count was 192\/\u00b5l (IQR: 72-346\/\u00b5l). 1,057 participants (56%) reported no, 370 (20%) reported 1-3, and 460 (24%) reported >3 barriers to care. By one year, 250 (13%, 95% CI: 12%, 15%) participants died. Adjusting for age, sex, education, baseline CD4 count, distance to clinic, and TB status, participants with 1-3 barriers (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.06, 2.08) and >3 barriers (aHR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.43) had higher 1-year mortality risk compared to those without barriers.\nHIV-infected individuals in South Africa who reported perceived barriers to medical care at diagnosis were more likely to die within one year. Targeted structural interventions such as extended clinic hours, travel vouchers, and streamlined clinic operations may improve linkage to care and ART initiation for these people.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.
