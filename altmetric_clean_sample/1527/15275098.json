Despite frequent human findings, its transmission routes and reservoirs remain largely unknown. Foodborne transmission and reservoir in cattle have been suspected, but with limited supporting evidence. This study describes the outbreak of SF O157 that occurred in Finland in 2012. The outbreak originated from a recreational farm selling unpasteurized milk, as revealed by epidemiologic and microbiological investigations, and involved six hospitalized children and two asymptomatic adults with culture-confirmed infection. An identical strain of SF O157 was isolated from patients, cattle and the farm environment, and epidemiologic analysis suggested unpasteurized milk as the vehicle of transmission. This study reports the first milkborne outbreak of SF O157, provides supporting evidence of cattle as a reservoir and highlights the health risks related to the consumption of unpasteurized milk.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f610003764","authors":["Jaakkonen, A.","Salmenlinna, S.","Rimhanen\u2010Finne, R.","Lundstr\u00f6m, H.","Heinikainen, S.","Hakkinen, M.","Hallanvuo, S."],"doi":"10.1111\/zph.12327","first_seen_on":"2017-01-06T23:21:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1863-2378"],"journal":"Zoonoses & Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1483896097,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/zph.12327\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/zph.12327\/pdf","pmid":"28045227","pubdate":"2017-01-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Veterinary","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"\n              Severe Outbreak of Sorbitol-Fermenting\n              Escherichia coli\n              O157 via Unpasteurized Milk and Farm Visits, Finland 2012\n            ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/severe-outbreak-sorbitolfermenting-escherichia-coli-o157-via-unpasteurized-milk-farm-visits-finland"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.6,"score_history":{"1y":3.6,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8019832,"mean":6.784478957969,"rank":1828778,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":6178263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8019832,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254241,"mean":12.618744800189,"rank":80569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":172974,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254241,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":382,"mean":3.7369868766404,"rank":88,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":293,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":382,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":6.6413333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":4,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":4,"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"ES":1,"SE":1,"GB":3}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/micheletjay\/statuses\/817511415330185216","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15275098],"posted_on":"2017-01-06T23:21:24+00:00","author":{"name":"Michele Jay-Russell","url":"http:\/\/www.wcfs.ucdavis.edu","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000359308075\/6f324bd96d6d28f803f390401c13f42b_normal.jpeg","description":"Food safety scientist, public health veterinarian, UC Davis alumni; interested in animals, pets, food, ag and health related issues.
