Few studies have analysed the factors associated with mortality and re-admissions in medical patients with SSTIs. Accordingly, this study sought to describe the clinical and microbiological characteristics of patients diagnosed with SSTIs, and identify mortality and re-admission related factors.\nA total of 308 patients were included in the study. Clinical, socio-demographic and microbiological characteristics were collected. Univariate and logistic regression multivariate analyses were performed in order to identify factors associated with mortality and re-admission.\nThe bacteria responsible were identified in 95 (30.8%) patients, with gram-positive bacteria being isolated in 67.4% and gram-negative in 55.8% of cases. Multi-resistant bacteria were frequent (39%), and the initial empirical treatment proved inadequate in 25.3% of all cases. In-hospital mortality was 14.9%; the related variables were heart failure (OR=5.96; 95%CI: 1.93-18.47), chronic renal disease (OR=6.04; 95%CI: 1.80-20.22), necrotic infection (OR=4.33; 95%CI: 1.26-14.95), and inadequate empirical treatment (OR=44.74; 95%CI: 5.40-370.73). Six-month mortality was 8%, with the main related factors being chronic renal disease (OR: 3.03; 95%CI: 1.06-8.66), and a Barthel Index score of under 20 (OR: 3.62; 95%CI: 1.17-11.21). Re-admission was necessary in 26.3% of cases, with the readmission-related variables being male gender (OR: 2.12; 95%CI: 1.14-3.94), peripheral vascular disease (OR: 3.05; 95%CI: 1.25-7.41), and an age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index score of over 3 (OR: 3.27; 95%CI: 1.40-7.63).\nClinical variables such as heart failure, chronic renal disease, peripheral vascular disease, and necrotic infection could help identify high-risk patients. The main factor associated with higher mortality was inadequate initial empirical treatment. Physicians should consider gram-negative, and even extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria when assigning initial empirical treatment for SSTIs, especially in healthcare-associated cases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6163cf058f61000728f","authors":["Mac\u00eda-Rodr\u00edguez, Cristina","Alende-Castro, Vanesa","Vazquez-Ledo, Lourdes","Novo-Veleiro, Ignacio","Gonz\u00e1lez-Quintela, Arturo"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.eimc.2016.02.030","first_seen_on":"2016-04-13T04:24:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1578-1852","0213005X"],"journal":"Enfermedades Infecciosas y Microbiolog\u00eda Cl\u00ednica (ScienceDirect)","last_mentioned_on":1460563009,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27061974?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27061974\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.eimc.2016.02.030"],"pmid":"27061974","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology","communicablediseases"],"title":"Skin and soft-tissue infections: Factors associated with mortality and re-admissions","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/skin-softtissue-infections-factors-associated-mortality-readmissions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7546003,"mean":6.5175573163071,"rank":3679990,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3675198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7546003,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270296,"mean":11.359147413011,"rank":135530,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":124423,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270296,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":351,"mean":1.6115142857143,"rank":119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":223,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":351,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.1380952380952,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ndm1bacteria\/statuses\/720105284178468865","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6637252],"posted_on":"2016-04-13T04:24:13+00:00","author":{"name":"Dave Roberts","url":"http:\/\/www.ndm1bacteria.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1294321879\/713px-EscherichiaColi_NIAID_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"ndm1bacteria","tweeter_id":"177368473","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":549},"tweet_id":"720105284178468865"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Adejsosa\/statuses\/720279583119921153","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6637252],"posted_on":"2016-04-13T15:56:49+00:00","author":{"name":"Anibal Sosa, MD.","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/adejsosa","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3124586659\/8d6470fd5ae0ced54ec243d52f65e5c1_normal.jpeg","description":"ID & CM Physician.
