GTVp was measured with treatment-planning computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans.\nGTVp was significantly associated with locoregional control, distant metastasis, and overall survival for patients with advanced NPC. Furthermore, T classification was not an independent prognostic factor. In receiver operator receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, 33 mL was determined as the cutoff points of GTVp for OS and locoregional control. Patients with a GTVp \u226533 mL had poorer OS, worse locoregional control, and more distant metastasis than patients with a GTVp <33 mL (P = .006, .009, .002, and .007, respectively).\nGTVp had significant prognostic value for patients with advanced NPC. The incorporation of GTVp could improve the current TNM classification system.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005c01","authors":["Li Qin","Fang Wu","Heming Lu","Bo Wei","Guisheng Li","Rensheng Wang"],"doi":"10.1177\/0194599816644408","first_seen_on":"2016-04-13T04:33:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1097-6817"],"journal":"Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1460539734,"links":["http:\/\/oto.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2016\/04\/06\/0194599816644408.abstract?rss=1&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/m.oto.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2016\/04\/06\/0194599816644408.abstract?papetoc"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/oto.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2016\/04\/06\/0194599816644408.full.pdf","pmid":"27071443","pubdate":"2016-04-12T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["otolaryngology","generalsurgery"],"title":"Tumor Volume Predicts Survival Rate of Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Treated with Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tumor-volume-predicts-survival-rate-advanced-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma-treated-concurrent-chemoradiot-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7546003,"mean":6.5175573163071,"rank":5711790,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1009894,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7546003,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270296,"mean":11.359214376884,"rank":189785,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":42377,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270296,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1852,"mean":4.5235969746083,"rank":1564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1852,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103,"mean":7.2055882352941,"rank":85,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
