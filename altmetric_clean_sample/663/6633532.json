All participants were evaluated using validated outcome questionnaires, radiographs, physical examination, instrumented motion analysis including a multisegmental foot model, and pedobarographic measurement.\nWithin the CPT group, the mean score of the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot scale was 89.9 (range, 76 to 100), and the mean score of the Oxford Ankle Foot Questionnaire (OAFQ) was 42.8 (range, 15 to 60). Motion analysis and pedobarographic measurement showed differences in biomechanical function of the foot and ankle on the side affected by CPT: a slower walking speed due to the short stride length; decreased dorsiflexion in hallux motion; increased hindfoot pronation in the presence of forefoot supination; diminished ankle push-off power; delayed time to heel-rise; and decreased forefoot pressure relative to hindfoot pressure. However, sagittal motion of the hindfoot and forefoot on the affected side was relatively well preserved. Subgroup analysis demonstrated no significant differences in terms of clinical outcome scores and most biomechanical parameters between the tibiofibular synostosis group and the intact-fibula group.\nChildren with atrophic-type CPT can obtain satisfactory foot and ankle function at maturity after successful Ilizarov treatment. Early stabilization of the ankle mortise by fibular stabilization and preservation of ankle mobility during and after treatment is thought to be crucial to maintaining function of the ankle in patients with CPT.\nTherapeutic Level III.
