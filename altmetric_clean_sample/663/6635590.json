We have also shown that rhinovirus-induced cytokine expression is abolished in Toll-like receptor (TLR2)(-\/-) bone marrow-derived macrophages.\nWe hypothesize that TLR2(+) macrophages are required and sufficient for rhinovirus-induced airway inflammation in\u00a0vivo.\nNaive and ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized and challenged C57BL\/6 wild-type and TLR2(-\/-) mice were infected with RV1B, followed by IgG or anti-TLR2, to determine the requirement and sufficiency of TLR2 for rhinovirus-induced airway responses. Bone marrow chimera experiments using OVA-treated C57BL\/6 and TLR2(-\/-) mice were also performed. Finally, naive TLR2(-\/-) mice underwent intranasal transfer of bone marrow-derived wild-type macrophages.\nRV1B infection of naive wild-type mice induced an influx of airway neutrophils and CD11b(+) exudative macrophages, which was reduced in TLR2(-\/-) mice. After allergen exposure, rhinovirus-induced neutrophilic and eosinophilic airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness were reduced in TLR2(-\/-) and anti-TLR2-treated mice. Transfer of TLR2(-\/-) bone marrow into wild-type, OVA-treated C57BL\/6 mice blocked rhinovirus-induced airway responses, whereas transfer of wild-type marrow to TLR2(-\/-) mice restored them. Finally, transfer of wild-type macrophages to naive TLR2(-\/-) mice was sufficient for neutrophilic inflammation after rhinovirus infection, whereas macrophages treated with IL-4 (to induce M2 polarization) were sufficient for eosinophilic inflammation, mucous metaplasia, and airways hyperresponsiveness.\nTLR2 is required for early inflammatory responses induced by rhinovirus, and TLR2(+) macrophages are sufficient to confer airway inflammation to TLR2(-\/-) mice, with the pattern of inflammation depending on the macrophage activation state.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b59","authors":["Mingyuan Han","Yutein Chung","Jun Young Hong","Charu Rajput","Jing Lei","Joanna L.
