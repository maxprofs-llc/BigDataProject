Suspected appendicitis visits were defined as any visit with the chief complaint of abdominal pain where a complete blood cell count was obtained. Abdominal CT and US in the PED and during hospital admission were compared across the 2 sites. Return visits within 72 hours were evaluated for any missed appendicitis.\nOverall appendicitis rates were similar at both sites: site A, 4.7%; site B, 4.0%. The odds of having a CT scan performed during visits to the PED for abdominal pain were significantly higher at site B (odds ratio [OR], 3.19; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.74-3.71), whereas the odds of having an US at site B were the opposite (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.28-0.40). When evaluating only the admitted visits, the odds of having a CT were also greater at site B (OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.86-2.94) and having an US were less (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.44-0.73).\nIn this study of 2 PEDs with differing practice models, we identified a dramatic difference in imaging utilization among patients with suspected appendicitis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005c16","authors":["Menoch, Margaret","Simon, Harold K","Hirsh, Daniel","Shim, Young","Baxter, Amy L","Clifton, Matthew","Kim, Daniel","Sturm, Jesse J","Simon, Harold K.","Baxter, Amy L.","Sturm, Jesse J."],"doi":"10.1097\/pec.0000000000000694","first_seen_on":"2016-04-12T19:08:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1535-1815","0749-5161"],"journal":"Pediatric emergency care","last_mentioned_on":1461070575,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27050738","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27050738?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/pec-online\/9000\/00000\/Imaging_for_Suspected_Appendicitis__Variation.99008.pdf?utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed"],"pmid":"27050738","pubdate":"2016-04-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics","emergencymedicine"],"title":"Imaging for Suspected Appendicitis: Variation Between Academic and Private Practice Models.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/pec-online\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Imaging_for_Suspected_Appendicitis__Variation.99008.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/imaging-suspected-appendicitis-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.58,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.58},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7571218,"mean":6.5337981331095,"rank":884350,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":6685387,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7571218,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271513,"mean":11.332606102124,"rank":46972,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":224246,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271513,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1970,"mean":2.9237420010157,"rank":155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":1812,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1970,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":87,"mean":2.0027906976744,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":82,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":87,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
