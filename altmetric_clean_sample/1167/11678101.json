Yet very few new, effective therapies for respiratory disease have been approved for use. A major contributing factor is the lack of biomarkers that can accurately quantify the lung inflammatory burden and that can be used to understand the contribution of lung inflammation to loss in lung function. Molecular imaging approaches can detect and quantify the recruitment and activation of specific immune cells in lung inflammation. We will review the clinical techniques used to image lung inflammation, provide an overview of clinical and emerging positron emission tomography (PET) techniques for quantifying lung inflammation, and discuss potential clinical applications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007da6","authors":["Scherer, Philip M","Chen, Delphine L","P.
