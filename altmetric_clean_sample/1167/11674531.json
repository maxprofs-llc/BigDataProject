A type of interspecific Nicotiana hybrid, Nicotiana suaveolens\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0N. tabacum exhibits temperature-sensitive lethality. This lethality results from programmed cell death (PCD) in hybrid seedlings, but this PCD occurs only in seedlings and suspension-cultured cells grown at 28\u00a0\u00b0C, not those grown at 36\u00a0\u00b0C. Plant PCD can be classified as vacuolar cell death or necrotic cell death. Induction of autophagy, vacuolar membrane collapse and actin disorganization are each known features of vacuolar cell death, but observed cases of PCD showing all these features simultaneously are rare. In this study, these features of vacuolar cell death were evident in hybrid tobacco cells expressing hybrid lethality. Ion leakage, plasma membrane disruption, increased activity of vacuolar processing enzyme, vacuolar membrane collapse, and formation of punctate F-actin foci were each evident in these cells. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that macroautophagic structures formed and tonoplasts ruptured in these cells. The number of cells that contained monodansylcadaverine (MDC)-stained structures and the abundance of nine autophagy-related gene transcripts increased just before cell death at 28\u00a0\u00b0C; these features were not evident at 36\u00a0\u00b0C. We assessed whether an autophagic inhibitor, wortmannin (WM), influenced lethality in hybrid cells. After the hybrid cell began to die, WM suppressed increases in ion leakage and cell deaths, and it decreased the number of cells containing MDC-stained structures. These results showed that several features indicative of autophagy and vacuolar cell death were evident in the hybrid tobacco cells subject to lethality. In addition, we documented a detailed time course of these vacuolar cell death features.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003336","authors":["Ueno, Naoya","Nihei, Saori","Miyakawa, Naoto","Hirasawa, Tadashi","Kanekatsu, Motoki","Marubashi, Wataru","van Doorn, Wouter G","Yamada, Tetsuya","Naoya Ueno","Saori Nihei","Naoto Miyakawa","Tadashi Hirasawa","Motoki Kanekatsu","Wataru Marubashi","Wouter G. van Doorn","Tetsuya Yamada"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00299-016-2048-1","first_seen_on":"2016-09-03T11:45:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-203X","0721-7714"],"journal":"Plant Cell Reports","last_mentioned_on":1502887448,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27585575?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00299-016-2048-1"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00299-016-2048-1.pdf","pmid":"27585575","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Biochemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["botany"],"title":"Time course of programmed cell death, which included autophagic features, in hybrid tobacco cells expressing hybrid lethality","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/time-course-programmed-cell-death-included-autophagic-features-hybrid-tobacco-cells-expressing-hybri"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8386076,"mean":7.0651873001299,"rank":6364427,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1136934,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8386076,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252525,"mean":12.491060342779,"rank":178350,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":42096,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252525,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":667,"mean":1.605978978979,"rank":336,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":194,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":667,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":1.5590909090909,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
