The aim was to examine whether this clinical impact of AndoSan(\u2122) intake could be explained by influence on foremost pro-inflammatory cytokines in the patients. Fifty patients with symptomatic UC and CD were randomized and blinded for oral daily intake of AndoSan(\u2122) or placebo. Blood samples taken before (visit 1) and after 21 days' (visit 3) consumption were analyzed for cytokines IL-1\u00df, IL-2, IL-4-8, IL-10, IL-12-13, IL-17, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFN-\u03b3, MCP-1, MIP-1\u00df and TNF-\u03b1. Baseline cytokine levels were similar in CD and UC. In CD cytokine levels at visit 1 versus visit 3 were unaltered within the AndoSan(\u2122) - and the placebo groups. Only IL-2 was significantly reduced at visit 3 in the Andosan(\u2122) - compared with the placebo group. However, when combining IL-1\u00df, IL-6 and G-CSF in the CD patients, there was a significant reduction in the Andosan(\u2122) group from visit 1 to visit 3. In UC levels of IL-2, IL-5 and MIP-1\u00df were reduced within the AndoSan(\u2122) group. IL-5 was also reduced at visit 3 compared with placebo. Generally, the effect on reduction in systemic cytokine levels by consumption of AndoSan(\u2122) was limited, and supported only marginally anti-inflammatory effects in these patients. Therefore, other explanations behind the clinical anti-inflammatory effects than the contribution of cytokines seem more pertinent, including anti-allergic and anti-oxidant activities.
