A photoelastic model was produced to stimulate this type of therapy in examples of Class II and III malocclusions. In the open situation, inter-arch activity precipitated occlusal plane rotation; counter clockwise in Class II malocclusion and clockwise in Class III. Comment is made on the force vectors involved when using intermaxillary elastics.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e9e","authors":["Stewart, C M","Chaconas, S J","Caputo, A A"],"first_seen_on":"2016-09-03T17:25:03+00:00","issns":["0305-182X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Oral Rehabilitation","last_mentioned_on":1472923488,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/280630"],"pmid":"280630","pubdate":"1978-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Effects of intermaxillary elastic traction on orthodontic tooth movement.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-intermaxillary-elastic-traction-orthodontic-tooth-movement"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8320311,"mean":7.0122256031246,"rank":2127705,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5057227,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8320311,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251997,"mean":12.465266369307,"rank":84076,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":163927,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251997,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":413,"mean":2.9868398058252,"rank":76,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":413,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":3,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Elastics (Orthodontics)","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=737563166#altmetric_citation_60efb418-e19f-4bc2-aa1d-160132442475","license":"public","citation_ids":[11679245,11679245],"posted_on":"2016-09-03T17:24:48+00:00","summary":"Elastics are rubber bands used in the field of Orthodontics frequently to correct malocclusions.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=51504333","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Hgcool23","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Hgcool23"}}]}}
