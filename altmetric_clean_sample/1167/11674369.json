The objective of this study was to evaluate an orally administered, encapsulated phage for efficient phage release in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of young chicks receiving feed. An optimized formulation that consisted of 0.8% low molecular weight (MW) alginate, 2% ultra-low molecular weight alginate and 3% whey protein completely released the encapsulated phage within 60\u00a0min under simulated intestinal conditions. This product was given to broiler chicks to determine passage time and distribution of the viable phage within the GIT. Following a single oral dose of 10(9) plaque-forming unit (PFU)\/chick, the major portion (peak concentration) of the encapsulated phage passed through the chick's GIT and was detected in the feces within 4 h, with low levels being continuously excreted for up to 24 h. In comparison, the passage of free phage through the GIT occurred faster as indicated by a peak concentration in feces after 1.5 h. In assessing the temporal phage distribution, both encapsulated and free phage treatments showed no apparent difference, both having low levels of 10(2) to 10(6) PFU\/g of contents along the entire GIT after 1, 2 and 4 h. These low concentrations recovered in vivo led us to examine various exposure conditions (with feed, fecal material, and buffer solutions) that were suspected to have affected phage viability\/infectivity during oral delivery, sample recovery, and enumeration by plaque assay. Results showed that the exposure conditions examined did not significantly reduce phage viability and could not account for the observed low phage levels following oral administration in chicks that are on feed. In conclusion, an oral encapsulated phage dose can take more than 4 h to completely move through the GIT of young chicks. Thus, repeated or higher doses may be necessary to attain higher phage concentrations in the GIT.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003375","authors":["Ma, Yin-Hing","Islam, Golam S","Wu, Ying","Sabour, Parviz M","Chambers, James R","Wang, Qi","Wu, Shirley X Y","Griffiths, Mansel W"],"doi":"10.3382\/ps\/pew260","first_seen_on":"2016-09-03T11:44:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1525-3171","0032-5791"],"journal":"Poultry Science","last_mentioned_on":1472898509,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27587723?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27587723","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"pew260","title":"Temporal distribution of encapsulated bacteriophages during passage through the chick gastrointestinal tract","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/temporal-distribution-encapsulated-bacteriophages-during-passage-through-chick-gastrointestinal-trac"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8320311,"mean":7.0122256031246,"rank":6016569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2006623,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8320311,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251996,"mean":12.465477148356,"rank":164034,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":73507,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251996,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1478,"mean":3.4772295192959,"rank":1093,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":354,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1478,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":1.0258823529412,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
