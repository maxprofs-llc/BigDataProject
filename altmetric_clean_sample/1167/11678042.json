Interestingly, of the targets that have been identified to promote repair following visual system damage, many are genes known to be mutated in different types of cancer. This review explores recent literature on the potential for modulating cancer genes as a therapeutic strategy for visual system repair and looks at the potential clinical challenges associated with implementing this type of therapy. We also discuss signalling mechanisms that have been implicated in cancer and consider how similar mechanisms may improve axonal regeneration in the optic nerve.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033be","authors":["Smith, Patrice D","Barber, Amanda","Farmer, Kyle","Martin, Keith R","Amanda Barber","Kyle Farmer","Keith R.
