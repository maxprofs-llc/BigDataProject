The otolaryngologist should be familiar with and consider these disorders when assessing the patient with swallowing difficulties.\nThe present review gives a brief overview of Sjogren's syndrome, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, pemphigus and pemphigoid, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma and inflammatory myopathies, and how they affect swallowing. Diagnosis of these diseases is generally based off of clinical presentation, serology, and\/or biopsy. Corticosteroids in combination with other immune modulators and symptomatic therapy are the mainstays of treatment. Treatment should be coordinated with a rheumatologist.\nThe otolaryngologist should be able to recognize when a systemic disease may be the cause of a patient's dysphagia and guide appropriate evaluation. Furthermore, the otolaryngologist can help localize the specific nature of the swallowing problem and guide or provide treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005868","authors":["Amos, Janine","Baron, Anthony","Rubin, Adam D"],"doi":"10.1097\/moo.0000000000000312","first_seen_on":"2016-09-03T15:49:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1531-6998","1068-9508"],"issue":"6","journal":"Current opinion in otolaryngology & head and neck surgery","last_mentioned_on":1472917756,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27585081"],"pmid":"27585081","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"Autoimmune swallowing disorders","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/autoimmune-swallowing-disorders"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8320311,"mean":7.0122256031246,"rank":4431748,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2315842,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8320311,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251996,"mean":12.465336074128,"rank":138870,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":88211,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251996,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":493,"mean":1.7652235772358,"rank":198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":232,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":493,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":0.93913043478261,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
