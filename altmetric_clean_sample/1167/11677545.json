CFX imprinted hydrogels (MIPs) were prepared applying different CFX: MAA molar ratios (1:16, 1:20 and 1:32) in feed composition of monomer solutions. Thermal polymerization was applied and hydrogels were synthesized in a polypropylene mold (0.4\u2009mm thickness). Swelling and binding properties of hydrogels were evaluated in water. Release profile of the MIPs was evaluated in NaCl (0.9%) and artificial tears. The data showed that enhancing the MAA concentration, as a co-monomer, and using molecular imprinting improved binding properties of the synthesized hydrogels. The optimized MIPs with 400\u2009mM MAA and CFX: MAA molar ratio of 1:20 and 1:16 showed the greatest affinity for CFX and the highest ability to control drug release. In vitro antibacterial activity of hydrogels was studied and demonstrated the effect of CFX-loaded hydrogels against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) and staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) isolated from patients' eyes. This study indicated antibacterial efficacy of CFX-loaded MIP hydrogels.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5653cf058f610004a8d","authors":["Kioomars, Sajedeh","Heidari, Somayeh","Malaekeh-Nikouei, Bizhan","Shayani Rad, Maryam","Khameneh, Bahman","Mohajeri, Seyed Ahmad"],"doi":"10.1080\/10837450.2016.1230131","endpage":"27","first_seen_on":"2016-09-03T13:10:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1097-9867","1083-7450"],"journal":"Pharmaceutical Development & Technology","last_mentioned_on":1472913471,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27585481?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27585481","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Ciprofloxacin-imprinted hydrogels for drug sustained release in aqueous media","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ciprofloxacinimprinted-hydrogels-drug-sustained-release-aqueous-media"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8320311,"mean":7.0122256031246,"rank":3730312,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4498049,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8320311,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251996,"mean":12.465344407627,"rank":108223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":140300,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251996,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":225,"mean":1.1213392857143,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":196,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":225,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
