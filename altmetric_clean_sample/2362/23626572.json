Transcribed data were analysed inductively through thematic analysis. Findings E-cigarettes were used as a therapeutic aid to stop or cut down smoking and as a smoking substitute. A prominent theme is the uncertainty e-cigarettes have generated. This included ambiguity of e-cigarettes' status and efficacy, and ambiguity of e-cigarettes' physical and social risks. Different attitudes towards e-cigarettes were identified.\nE-cigarettes' benefits and risks should be continuously evaluated, put into perspective and circulated to avoid ambiguity. Stop smoking services need to recognise the benefits that can be gained by using e-cigarettes as a harm reduction tool.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000338b","authors":["Tamimi, Nancy"],"doi":"10.1017\/s1463423617000445","first_seen_on":"2017-08-11T16:11:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1463-4236","1477-1128"],"journal":"Primary Health Care Research & Development (Cambridge University Press \/ UK)","last_mentioned_on":1502467896,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28774353"],"pmid":"28774353","publisher":"Cambridge University Press (CUP)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["healthservicesresearch","primaryhealthcare"],"title":"Knowledge, attitudes and beliefs towards e-cigarettes among e-cigarette users and stop smoking advisors in South East England: a qualitative study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/knowledge-attitudes-beliefs-towards-ecigarettes-among-ecigarette-users-stop-smoking-advisors-south-e"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8355069,"mean":7.046560105308,"rank":6340142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1132752,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8355069,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178864,"mean":12.456714904704,"rank":126186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":32824,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178864,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171,"mean":4.6296352941176,"rank":128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":3.15,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
