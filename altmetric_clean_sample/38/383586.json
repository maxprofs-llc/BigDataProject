It is unclear precisely how these \u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) act to preferentially spare A\u03b240 production as well as Notch processing and signaling. In an effort to determine the substrate requirements in NSAID\/GSM activity, we determined the effects of sulindac sulfide and flurbiprofen on \u03b3-cleavage of artificial constructs containing several \u03b3-secretase substrates. Using FLAG-tagged constructs that expressed extracellularly truncated APP, Notch-1, or CD44, we found that these substrates have different sensitivities to sulindac sulfide. \u03b3-Secretase cleavage of APP was altered by sulindac sulfide, but CD44 and Notch-1 were either insensitive or only minimally altered by this compound. Using chimeric APP constructs, we observed that the transmembrane domain (TMD) of APP played a pivotal role in determining drug sensitivity. Substituting the APP TMD with that of APLP2 retained the sensitivity to \u03b3-cleavage modulation, but replacing TMDs from Notch-1 or ErbB4 rendered the resultant molecules insensitive to drug treatment. Specifically, the GXXXG motif within APP appeared to be critical to GSM activity. Consequently, the modulatory effects on \u03b3-cleavage appears to be substrate-dependent. We hypothesize that the substrate present in the \u03b3-secretase complex influences the conformation of the complex so that the binding site of GSMs is either stabilized or less favorable to influence the cleavage of the respective substrates.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m111.277228","first_seen_on":"2011-09-27T00:19:43+00:00","issns":["1083-351X"],"journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1315958400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21868380"],"pmid":"21868380","pubdate":"2011-08-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Substrate sequence influences {gamma}-secretase modulator activity: role of the transmembrane domain of the amyloid precursor protein.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/substrate-sequence-influences-%CE%B3secretase-modulator-activity-role-transmembrane-domain-amyloid-precur"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632582,"mean":4.9236596667819,"rank":2015229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":945589,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632582,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62011,"mean":4.1210215126592,"rank":25047,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":27239,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62011,"percentile":43},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28043,"mean":2.6371214606661,"rank":19751,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":4107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28043,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148,"mean":1.4241496598639,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":81,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
