We show that one client, the p53 DNA-binding domain, undergoes a structural change in the presence of Hsp90 to adopt a molten globule-like state. Addition of one- and two-domain constructs of Hsp90, as well as the full-length three-domain protein, to isotopically labeled p53 led to reduction in NMR signal intensity throughout p53, particularly in its central \u03b2-sheet. This reduction seems to be associated with a change of structure of p53 without formation of a distinct complex with Hsp90. Fluorescence and hydrogen-exchange measurements support a loosening of the structure of p53 in the presence of Hsp90 and its domains. We propose that Hsp90 interacts with p53 by multiple transient interactions, forming a dynamic heterogeneous manifold of conformational states that resembles a molten globule.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f61000316f","authors":["Sung Jean Park","Brendan N Borin","Maria A Martinez-Yamout","H Jane Dyson"],"doi":"10.1038\/nsmb.2045","endpage":"541","first_seen_on":"2011-10-02T11:11:37+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["1545-9993","1545-9985"],"journal":"Nature Structural & Molecular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1317552726,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nsmb\/journal\/v18\/n5\/full\/nsmb.2045.html"],"pmid":"21460846","pubdate":"2011-04-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"537","subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"The client protein p53 adopts a molten globule\u00e2\u0080\u0093like state in the presence of Hsp90","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/client-protein-p53-adopts-molten-globulelike-state-presence-hsp90"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506214,"mean":5.1186469373082,"rank":3109612,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":998690,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506214,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65593,"mean":4.4717936028784,"rank":40336,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":18047,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65593,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1632,"mean":5.814652360515,"rank":1421,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":136,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1632,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":10.92408,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":32,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
