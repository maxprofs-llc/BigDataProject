However, it is controversially debated how many SNARE complexes are minimally needed for SV priming and fusion. To quantify this effective number, we measured the fluorescence responses from single fusing vesicles expressing pHluorin (pHl), a pH-sensitive variant of GFP, fused to the luminal domain of the vesicular SNARE syb2 (spH) in cultured hippocampal neurons lacking endogenous syb2. Fluorescence responses were quantal, with the unitary signals precisely corresponding to single pHluorin molecules. Using this approach we found that two copies of spH per SV fully rescued evoked fusion whereas SVs expressing only one spH were unable to rapidly fuse upon stimulation. Thus, two syb2 molecules and likely two SNARE complexes are necessary and sufficient for SV fusion during fast synaptic transmission.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2011PNAS..10814318S","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","doi":"10.1073\/pnas.1101818108","first_seen_on":"2011-09-26T23:32:20+00:00","issns":["1091-6490"],"issue":"34","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1330473600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21844343"],"pmid":"21844343","pubdate":"2011-08-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Acad Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Two synaptobrevin molecules are sufficient for vesicle fusion in central nervous system synapses.","type":"article","volume":"108","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/two-synaptobrevin-molecules-sufficient-vesicle-fusion-central-nervous-system-synapses"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3619418,"mean":4.9283821178971,"rank":2015850,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":926473,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3619418,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61663,"mean":4.1929952645065,"rank":25278,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":26270,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61663,"percentile":42},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33563,"mean":13.679191347357,"rank":23250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":4372,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33563,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":703,"mean":10.896034188034,"rank":412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":211,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":703,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":20,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
