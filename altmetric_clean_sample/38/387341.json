Although several reports have demonstrated that the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DRB1*08:03 allele is associated with disease susceptibility in Japan, the precise analysis of HLA haplotypes and the role of amino acid alignment have not been fully clarified. We investigated HLA class I A, B, and C and HLA class II DRB1 and DQB1 alleles and haplotypes in 229 Japanese patients with PBC and compared them with the published data of 523 healthy subjects. Significant associations were found with PBC susceptibility for the DRB1*08:03-DQB1*06:01 (13% versus 6%; P = 0.000025; odds ratio [OR] = 2.22) and DRB1*04:05-DQB1*04:01 haplotypes (17% versus 13%; P = 0.044; OR = 1.38). Conversely, there were significant protective associations with the DRB1*13:02-DQB1*06:04 (2% versus 5%; P = 0.00093; OR = 0.27) and DRB1*11:01-DQB1*03:01 haplotypes (1% versus 4%; P = 0.03; OR = 0.37). The frequency of the DRB1*09:01-DQB1*03:03 haplotype was significantly higher in patients who had received orthotopic liver transplantation (33% versus 11%; P = 0.0012; OR = 3.96). Furthermore, the frequency of serine at position 57 (P = 0.0000015; OR = 1.83) of the DR\u03b2chain differed the most in patients with PBC, compared with healthy subjects.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61a3cf058f610007619","doi":"10.1002\/hep.24705","first_seen_on":"2011-09-30T12:58:57+00:00","issns":["1527-3350"],"journal":"Hepatology","last_mentioned_on":1317386437,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21953406?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21953406","pubdate":"2011-09-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"HLA class II molecules confer both susceptibility and progression in Japanese patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/human-leukocyte-antigen-class-ii-molecules-confer-both-susceptibility-progression-japanese-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":3107990,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":982777,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64707,"mean":4.5295335517571,"rank":40258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":14927,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64707,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2886,"mean":3.6591154246101,"rank":2064,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":566,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2886,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":1.9572444444444,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
