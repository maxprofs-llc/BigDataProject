The structures of the majority of predominant peptide components isolated from the extract were studied. The use of a database of protein structures helped suggest possible structures of protein precursors of the peptides isolated. Detailed information on a plant peptidome was obtained for the first time.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9193cf058f61000d2b6","first_seen_on":"2011-09-28T00:53:14+00:00","issns":["0132-3423"],"issue":"2","journal":"Bioorganicheskaia khimiia","last_mentioned_on":1317171139,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16637293"],"pmid":"16637293","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"[Isolation and structure of peptides from oat (Avena sativa) seedlings].","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/isolation-structure-peptides-oat-avena-sativa-seedlings"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3616388,"mean":4.9295982487525,"rank":2015421,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":924644,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3616388,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61735,"mean":4.187508083066,"rank":25279,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":26289,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61735,"percentile":42},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":1.9097222222222,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"BR":1},"mendeley":{"PL":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/bettysouza\/status\/118850490640510977","citation_ids":[384588],"posted_on":"2011-09-28T00:52:19+00:00","author":{"name":"Elizabete C\u00e2ndido","url":"http:\/\/holdingbackthefire.blogspot.com\/","image":"http:\/\/a3.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1632342544\/berserk_casca_normal.jpg","description":"Scientist project, music lover, anime addicted... a person under construction!","id_on_source":"bettysouza","tweeter_id":"198181604","geo":{"lt":-15.77846,"ln":-47.928661,"country":"BR"},"followers":96},"tweet_id":"118850490640510977"}]}}
