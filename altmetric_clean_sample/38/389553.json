B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is emerging as a potential marker of hydration state. Proteinuria is used as a predictor of outcome in severe illness and might correlate to systemic capillary leakage. This study investigates whether combining BNP and proteinuria can be used as a guide for individualized resuscitation and as a predictor of outcome in patients with severe burns.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000805","authors":["Karina de Leeuw","Marianne K Nieuwenhuis","Anuschka S Niemeijer","Hans Eshuis","Gerard IJM Beerthuizen","Wilbert M Janssen"],"doi":"10.1186\/cc10297","first_seen_on":"2011-10-03T08:45:29+00:00","issns":["1466-609X","1364-8535"],"issue":"4","journal":"Critical Care","last_mentioned_on":1347967512,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21722363"],"pmid":"21722363","pubdate":"2011-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["criticalcare"],"title":"Increased B-type natriuretic peptide and decreased proteinuria might reflect decreased capillary leakage and is associated with a better outcome in patients with severe burns.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/ccforum.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/cc10297","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increased-btype-natriuretic-peptide-decreased-proteinuria-reflect-decreased-capillary-leakage-associ"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506935,"mean":5.125739366827,"rank":2319041,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1558584,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506935,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65960,"mean":4.5547536196728,"rank":28209,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":26914,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65960,"percentile":40},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2510,"mean":5.3382574730968,"rank":1659,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":514,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2510,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":2.6383529411765,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Postgraduate":3,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":13,"Chemistry":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Computer Science":1,"Unspecified":1,"Arts and Humanities":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"NL":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BiebMartiniZkh\/statuses\/248019840760168448","license":"public","citation_ids":[389553],"posted_on":"2012-09-18T11:25:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Leerhuis bibliotheek","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/460791254842753025\/tN6fgYX0_normal.jpeg","description":"K.W.
