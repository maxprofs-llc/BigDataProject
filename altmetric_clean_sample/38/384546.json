The sample consisted of 160 university students (18-30 years) with varying degrees of hair loss (stages II-VII on the Norwood-Hamilton Scale). Three ways of coping were distinguished: compensation, avoidance, and acceptance. Psychological distress due to hair loss depended neither on the age of participants nor on the stage of balding. Since compensation and avoidance were associated with high levels of distress, their functional value might be questioned. Acceptance, however, was negatively related to distress--even, or rather, especially when stage of hair loss was advanced. Furthermore, acceptance had a direct negative effect on medical consultation about hair loss. By contrast, compensation and avoidance had a positive distress-mediated effect on medical consultation. Taken together, this study underlines the adaptive role of acceptance when confronted with irreversible changes such as androgenetic alopecia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fe3cf058f610006120","doi":"10.1016\/j.bodyim.2011.06.006","first_seen_on":"2011-09-28T00:13:27+00:00","issns":["17401445"],"journal":"Body Image","last_mentioned_on":1400234104,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S174014451100091X","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/21855434\/"],"pmid":"21855434","pubdate":"2011-08-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Studies In Human Society","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Young men's coping with androgenetic alopecia: Acceptance counts when hair gets thinner ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/young-mens-coping-androgenetic-alopecia-acceptance-counts-hair-gets-thinner"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7990040,"mean":6.7366729331304,"rank":3168006,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4797480,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7990040,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80077,"mean":5.5228648034367,"rank":28363,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":51613,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80077,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":400,"mean":10.261218045113,"rank":212,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":186,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":400,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":5.0857142857143,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
