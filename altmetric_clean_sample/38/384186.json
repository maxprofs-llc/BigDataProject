We studied con\ufb01gurations of strips cut from pod valve tissue and from composite elastic materials that mimic its structure. The experiments reveal various helical con\ufb01gurations with sharp morphological transitions between them. Using the mathematical framework of \"incompatible elasticity,\" we modeled the pod as a thin strip with a flat intrinsic metric and a saddle-like intrinsic curvature. Our theoretical analysis quantitatively predicts all observed con\ufb01gurations, thus linking the pod's microscopic structure and macroscopic conformation. We suggest that this type of incompatible strip is likely to play a role in the self-assembly of chiral macromolecules and could be used for the engineering of synthetic self-shaping devices.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2011Sci...333.1726A","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["Shahaf Armon","Efi Efrati","Raz Kupferman","Eran Sharon"],"doi":"10.1126\/science.1203874","first_seen_on":"2011-09-27T14:05:10+00:00","issns":["1095-9203"],"journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":1317420521,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/content\/333\/6050\/1726?utm_content=tweetdeck&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=science&utm_source=shortener","http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/content\/333\/6050\/1726.full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/content\/333\/6050\/1726.full.pdf","pmid":"21940888","pubdate":"2011-09-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Geometry and Mechanics in the Opening of Chiral Seed Pods","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/geometry-mechanics-opening-chiral-seed-pods"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628371,"mean":4.9417862081361,"rank":817161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628371,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61995,"mean":4.157499403168,"rank":12496,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":47466,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61995,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27894,"mean":21.019190119385,"rank":15061,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":7275,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27894,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":711,"mean":17.914876056338,"rank":423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":281,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":711,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":14,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":40,"Student  > Doctoral Student":10,"Student  > Ph.
