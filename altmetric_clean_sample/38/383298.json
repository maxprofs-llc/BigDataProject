Participants were randomly assigned to a computerized training program involving either faces or houses. Pre- and post-testing included standardized and experimental measures of behavior and event-related brain potentials (ERPs), as well as interviews after training. After training, all participants met behavioral criteria for expertise with the specific stimuli on which they received training. Scores on standardized measures improved after training for both groups, but only the face training group showed an increased face inversion effect behaviorally and electrophysiological changes to faces in the P100 component. These findings suggest that individuals with ASD can gain expertise in face processing through training.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cb4","authors":["Faja S","Webb SJ","Jones E","Merkle K","Kamara D","Bavaro J","Aylward E","Dawson G","Susan Faja","Sara Jane Webb","Emily Jones","Kristen Merkle","Dana Kamara","Joshua Bavaro","Elizabeth Aylward","Geraldine Dawson"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10803-011-1243-8","endpage":"293","first_seen_on":"2011-09-26T23:57:01+00:00","issns":["1573-3432","0162-3257"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Autism & Developmental Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1316649600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21484517"],"pmid":"21484517","pubdate":"2011-04-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"278","subjects":["psychiatry","pediatrics"],"title":"The Effects of Face Expertise Training on the Behavioral Performance and Brain Activity of Adults with High Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorders.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s10803-011-1243-8","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-face-expertise-training-behavioral-performance-brain-activity-adults-high-functioning-autism-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629591,"mean":4.9337473984712,"rank":2015979,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":940085,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629591,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61735,"mean":4.1487304240775,"rank":25052,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":26913,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61735,"percentile":43},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1501,"mean":6.526652,"rank":1089,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":300,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1501,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":4.7732,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Librarian":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":17,"Student  > Ph.
