The studied sample consists of 103 healthy unrelated individuals, aged 20-45 years. All individuals are of Roma origin, residents of different geographical regions (Gostivar, Skopje, and Kochani). The population genetics analysis package, Arlequin, was used for analysis of the data. We found that all 16 KIR genes were observed in the Roma individuals and framework genes (KIR3DL3, KIR3DP1, KIR- 2DL4, and KIR3DL2) were present in all individuals. The frequencies of other KIR genes were: KIR2DP1 (1), KIR2DL1 (0.961), KIR2DL2 (0.544), KIR2DL3 (0.874), KIR2DL5 (0.311), KIR3DL1 (0.990), KIR- 2DS1 (0.330), KIR2DS2 (0.553), KIR2DS3 (0.359), KIR2DS4 (0.981), KIR2DS5 (0.291), and KIR3DS1 (0.379). The results of tested linkage disequilibrium (LD) among KIR genes demonstrated that KIR genes present a wide range of linkage disequilibrium. The obtained results for KIR genes and genotype frequencies in Macedonian Roma individuals can be used for anthropological comparisons.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b5e","authors":["Petlichkovski, A.","Djulejic, E.","Trajkov, D.","Efinska\u2010Mladenovska, O.","Hristomanova, S.","Kirijas, M.","Senev, A.","Spiroski, M."],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1744-313x.2011.01039.x","endpage":"500","first_seen_on":"2011-09-30T08:31:22+00:00","issns":["1744-313X","1744-3121"],"issue":"6","journal":"International Journal of Immunogenetics","last_mentioned_on":1317371053,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/j.1744-313X.2011.01039.x"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1744-313X.2011.01039.x\/pdf","pmid":"21955885","pubdate":"2011-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"493","subjects":["genetics","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Distribution of killer cell immunoglobulin\u00e2\u0080\u0090like receptor genes in Roma from Republic of Macedonia","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/distribution-killer-cell-immunoglobulinlike-receptor-genes-roma-republic-macedonia-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":3107993,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":982775,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64707,"mean":4.5295683244212,"rank":40259,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":14920,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64707,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143,"mean":1.2918169014085,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.375,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Ph.
