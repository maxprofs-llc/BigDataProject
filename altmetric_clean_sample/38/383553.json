These tumors commonly lead to neurologic, endocrinological, or visual symptoms. Radical surgery is the treatment of choice in craniopharyngiomas. The transnasal\/transsphenoidal endoscopic approach offers the possibility of removing the tumor without retracting brain and optic pathways, with good results. The rate of cerebrospinal fluid fistula has improved due to the use of vascularized mucosal flaps for cranial base reconstruction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f61000841c","doi":"10.1016\/j.otc.2011.06.015","first_seen_on":"2011-09-27T00:16:14+00:00","issns":["1557-8259"],"issue":"4","journal":"Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America","last_mentioned_on":1315526400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21819881"],"pmid":"21819881","pubdate":"2011-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"Craniopharyngioma.","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/craniopharyngioma-16"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3636226,"mean":4.921076943263,"rank":2018547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":945994,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3636226,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62026,"mean":4.1099564046755,"rank":24987,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":27451,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62026,"percentile":44},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155,"mean":1.8701168831169,"rank":81,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
