Here, we extensively validated immune-deficient mice to facilitate further development of the therapeutic potential of TCR-engineered T cells. Treatment of human melanoma-bearing SCID or NSG mice with high doses of human T cells transduced with an hgp100\/HLA-A2-specific TCR did not result in antitumor responses irrespective of chemotherapeutic preconditioning. Imaging of human green fluorescent protein-labeled T cells demonstrated significant T-cell accumulation in intratumoral vasculature directly upon T-cell transfer, which was followed by loss of T cells within 72\u2009hr. Peripheral persistence of human T cells was highly compromised and appeared related to T-cell differentiation. On the contrary, adoptive transfer (AT) of relatively low numbers of hgp100\/HLA-A2 TCR-transduced mouse T cells resulted in rapid clearance of large established human melanomas. Unexpectedly and in contrast to reported studies with chimeric antibody receptor-engineered T cells, antitumor activity and homeostatic expansion of T cells were independent of TCR transgene as evidenced in two SCID strains and using two different human melanoma cell lines. Interestingly, the xeno-reactive melanoma response of mouse T cells appeared to be dictated by CD4(+) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and did not require in vitro T-cell activation, retroviral gene transfer, or subcutaneous interleukin-2 support. Taken together, AT of human but not mouse T cells in human melanoma-bearing immune-deficient mice is in close accordance with clinical studies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002a0c","doi":"10.1089\/hum.2010.126","first_seen_on":"2011-10-03T07:27:15+00:00","issns":["1557-7422"],"journal":"Human Gene Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1317625608,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21958294?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21958294","pubdate":"2011-09-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Biotechnology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"T cell receptor gene therapy in human melanoma-bearing immune-deficient mice: human but not mouse T cells recapitulate outcome of clinical studies.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tcell-receptor-gene-therapy-human-melanomabearing-immunedeficient-mice-human-not-mouse-t-cells-recap-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":3107974,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":982839,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65959,"mean":4.4814312744473,"rank":40923,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":15328,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65959,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":310,"mean":6.213074433657,"rank":230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":62,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":310,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":2.7195555555556,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
