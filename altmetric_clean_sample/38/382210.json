Here we performed a comparative study with atomic force microscopy (AFM), fluorescence microscopy (FM), and surface-enhanced ellipsometric contrast (SEEC) microscopy of phospholipid membrane stacks consisting of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) with high admixing of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[6-[(2,4-dinitrophenyl)amino]hexanoyl] (DNP Cap PE) produced by DPN. We present a structural model of membrane stacking based on the combined information gained from the three microscopic techniques. Domains of phase-separated DNP Cap PE can be detected at high DNP Cap PE admixing that are not present at medium or low admixings. While the optical methods allow for a high-throughput screening of lithographic structures (compared to AFM), it was found that, when relying on FM alone, artifacts due to phase-separation phenomena can be introduced in the case of thin membrane stacks.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fd3","authors":["Michael Hirtz","Re\u0301mi Corso","Sylwia Sekula-Neuner","Harald Fuchs"],"doi":"10.1021\/la202703j","endpage":"11608","first_seen_on":"2011-09-26T16:24:17+00:00","issns":["0743-7463","1520-5827"],"issue":"18","journal":"Langmuir","last_mentioned_on":1338543639,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/doi:10.1021\/la202703j"],"pmid":"21812484","pubdate":"2011-09-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"11605","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Comparative Height Measurements of Dip-Pen Nanolithography-Produced Lipid Membrane Stacks with Atomic Force, Fluorescence, and Surface-Enhanced Ellipsometric Contrast Microscopy","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparative-height-measurements-dippen-nanolithographyproduced-lipid-membrane-stacks-atomic-force-fl"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628597,"mean":4.9402458135364,"rank":312035,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":3314589,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628597,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61730,"mean":4.1614901909961,"rank":5459,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":56235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61730,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1447,"mean":2.7409847856155,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":1383,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1447,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":1.1911020408163,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
