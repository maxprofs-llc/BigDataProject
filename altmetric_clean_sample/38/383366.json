Only the sister of one of the 10 unmarried deceased men was in contact with the bank. Four widows elected to discard the frozen sperm and all of the remaining spouses were uninterested in its fate. Because none of the samples were requested for use, the need for sperm procurement should be reconsidered.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028c7","doi":"10.1016\/j.fertnstert.2011.04.066","first_seen_on":"2011-09-27T00:01:21+00:00","issns":["1556-5653"],"issue":"8","journal":"Fertility & Sterility","last_mentioned_on":1316044800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21620393"],"pmid":"21620393","pubdate":"2011-06-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Nationwide use of postmortem retrieved sperm in Israel: a follow-up report.","type":"article","volume":"95","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nationwide-postmortem-retrieved-sperm-israel-followup-report"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629179,"mean":4.9362043867828,"rank":2016376,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":938697,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629179,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62000,"mean":4.1473927643994,"rank":25181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":26940,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62000,"percentile":43},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2289,"mean":3.9288881118881,"rank":1369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":426,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2289,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":2.8242424242424,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Student  > Ph.
