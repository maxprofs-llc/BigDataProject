It comes as no surprise that dozens of genome assemblies are released per months now. Since the number of next-generation sequencing machines increases worldwide and new major sequencing plans are announced, a further increase in the speed of releasing genome assemblies is expected. Thus it becomes increasingly important to get an overview as well as detailed information about available sequenced genomes. The different sequencing and assembly methods have specific characteristics that need to be known to evaluate the various genome assemblies before performing subsequent analyses.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000798","authors":["Bj\u00f6rn Hammesfahr","Bj\u00f6rn Hammesfahr","Florian Odronitz","Marcel Hellkamp","Martin Kollmar"],"doi":"10.1186\/1756-0500-4-338","first_seen_on":"2011-09-26T20:59:36+00:00","issns":["","1756-0500"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Research Notes","last_mentioned_on":1317107929,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1756-0500\/4\/338"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1756-0500-4-338.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3180467","pmid":"21906294","pubdate":"2011-09-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"338","subjects":["medicine","biology"],"title":"diArk 2.0 provides detailed analyses of the ever increasing eukaryotic genome sequencing data","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diark-20-provides-detailed-analyses-ever-increasing-eukaryotic-genome-sequencing-data"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":1004548,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":4025907,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66707,"mean":5.0124080892273,"rank":12632,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":53866,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66707,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1608,"mean":3.9444144368388,"rank":258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":1346,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1608,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":3.4541176470588,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":4,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
