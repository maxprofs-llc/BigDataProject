However, the specific impact of N-methylation on passive membrane diffusion in cyclic peptides has not been investigated systematically. Here we report a method for the selective, on-resin N-methylation of cyclic peptides to generate compounds with drug-like membrane permeability and oral bioavailability. The selectivity and degree of N-methylation of the cyclic peptide was dependent on backbone stereochemistry, suggesting that conformation dictates the regiochemistry of the N-methylation reaction. The permeabilities of the N-methyl variants were corroborated by computational studies on a 1,024-member virtual library of N-methyl cyclic peptides. One of the most permeable compounds, a cyclic hexapeptide (molecular mass = 755 Da) with three N-methyl groups, showed an oral bioavailability of 28% in rat.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f610004264","authors":["Tina R White","Chad M Renzelman","Arthur C Rand","Taha Rezai","Cayla M McEwen","Vladimir M Gelev","Rushia A Turner","Roger G Linington","Siegfried S F Leung","Amit S Kalgutkar","Jonathan N Bauman","Yizhong Zhang","Spiros Liras","David A Price","Alan M Mathiowetz","Matthew P Jacobson","R Scott Lokey","White TR","Renzelman CM","Rand AC","Rezai T","McEwen CM","Gelev VM","Turner RA","Linington RG","Leung SS","Kalgutkar AS","Bauman JN","Zhang Y","Liras S","Price DA","Mathiowetz AM","Jacobson MP","Lokey RS"],"doi":"10.1038\/nchembio.664","endpage":"817","first_seen_on":"2011-09-26T18:24:48+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1552-4450","1552-4469"],"issue":"11","journal":"Nature Chemical Biology","last_mentioned_on":1357930500,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nchembio\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/abs\/nchembio.664.html","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21946276"],"pmcid":"PMC3210067","pmid":"21946276","pubdate":"2011-09-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"810","subjects":["chemistry","biology"],"title":"On-resin N-methylation of cyclic peptides for discovery of orally bioavailable scaffolds","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/onresin-nmethylation-cyclic-peptides-discovery-orally-bioavailable-scaffolds"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12.156,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12.156},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":302370,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":4204687,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64753,"mean":4.5985080924141,"rank":4637,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":60115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64753,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1219,"mean":10.669045977011,"rank":270,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":949,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1219,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":4.7554871794872,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":9,"Researcher":47,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
