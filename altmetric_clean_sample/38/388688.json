Although mouse models of HUS have been evaluated using Shiga toxin (STx) combined with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS), no HUS model has been tested using purified outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) from STx-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O157:H7. Accordingly, we investigated whether OMVs of STEC O157:H7 conveying STx2 and LPS can cause HUS-like symptoms in mice inoculated intraperitoneally. Three types of OMVs differing in LPS acylation status and STx2 amount were used to compare their ability to induce HUS-like symptoms. Native OMVs (nOMV) with fully hexa-acylated LPS caused HUS-like symptoms at 72-96\u00a0h after dually divided injections of 1\u00a0\u03bcg nOMV per animal. However, elevated doses of modified OMVs (mOMV) carrying mainly penta-acylated LPS were required to induce similar HUS signs. Moreover, mitomycin-C-induced OMVs (mcOMV) that were enriched with STx2 induced HUS-like symptoms similar to those of nOMV at the same dose. These results suggest that the OMVs of STEC O157:H7 potentiated with STx2 and fully hexa-acylated LPS can be utilized for inducing HUS-like symptoms in mice and could be the causative material involved in the development of HUS.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028c2","authors":["Kim, Sang\u2010Hyun","Lee, Yong\u2010Hoon","Lee, Sang\u2010Ho","Lee, Sang\u2010Rae","Huh, Jae\u2010Won","Kim, Sun\u2010Uk","Chang, Kyu\u2010Tae"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1574-695x.2011.00869.x","endpage":"434","first_seen_on":"2011-10-02T02:21:33+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1574-695X","0928-8244"],"issue":"3","journal":"FEMS Immunology & Medical Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1317531704,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/j.1574-695X.2011.00869.x"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1574-695X.2011.00869.x\/pdf","pmid":"22029600","pubdate":"2011-10-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"427","subjects":["microbiology","communicablediseases","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Mouse model for hemolytic uremic syndrome induced by outer membrane vesicles of Escherichia coli O157:H7","type":"article","volume":"63","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mouse-model-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-induced-outer-membrane-vesicles-iescherichia-colii-o157h7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505992,"mean":5.1115236646191,"rank":2979206,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1396391,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505992,"percentile":30},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65590,"mean":4.4479180960222,"rank":37309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":26032,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65590,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189,"mean":1.9217978723404,"rank":112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":68,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.99285714285714,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/NewMicrobiology\/status\/120316103854530560","citation_ids":[388688],"posted_on":"2011-10-02T01:56:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Luke Scicluna","url":"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/lukescicluna","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/714765798\/Luke_Scicluna_normal.jpg","description":"I am a Marketing manager for a Biotechnology company in the UK.
