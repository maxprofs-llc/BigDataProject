Treatment of the square-planar [Pd(CNP)Cl](AgCl2) complex 2a with KHMDS produces the selective deprotonation at the CH2P arm of the pincer to yield the pyridine-dearomatised complex 3a. A series of cationic [Ir(CNP)(cod)](+) complexes 4 has been prepared by reaction of the imidazolium salts 1 with Ir(acac)(cod). These derivatives exhibit in the solid state, and in solution, a distorted trigonal bipyramidal structure in which the CNP ligands adopt an unusual C(axial)-N(equatorial)-P(equatorial) coordination mode. Reactions of complexes 4 with CO and H2 yield the carbonyl species 5a(Cl) and 6a(Cl), and the dihydrido derivatives 7, respectively. Furthermore, upon reaction of complex 4b(Br) with base, selective deprotonation at the methylene CH2P arms is observed. The, thus formed, deprotonated Ir complex 8b reacts with H2 in a ligand-assisted process leading to the trihydrido complex 9b, which can also be obtained by reaction of 7b(Cl) with H2 in the presence of KO(t)Bu. Finally, the catalytic activity of Ir-CNP complexes in the hydrogenation of ketones has been briefly assessed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Pr\u00e1xedes S\u00e1nchez","Mart\u00edn Hern\u00e1ndez-Ju\u00e1rez","Eleuterio \u00c1lvarez","Margarita Paneque","Nuria Rend\u00f3n","Andr\u00e9s Su\u00e1rez"],"doi":"10.1039\/c6dt03652j","endpage":"17009","first_seen_on":"2016-09-27T16:15:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1477-9234"],"issue":"42","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1479711619,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2016\/DT\/C6DT03652J?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=inorganicnews","http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2016\/DT\/C6DT03652J#!divAbstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2016\/dt\/c6dt03652j","pmid":"27722364","pubdate":"2016-09-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"16997","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Synthesis, structure and reactivity of Pd and Ir complexes based on new lutidine-derived NHC\/phosphine mixed pincer ligands","type":"article","volume":"45","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-structure-reactivity-pd-ir-complexes-based-new-lutidinederived-nhcphosphine-mixed-pincer-l"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7722452,"mean":6.6241115612059,"rank":5563503,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1882513,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7722452,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244402,"mean":12.461682685422,"rank":159112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":72534,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244402,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10887,"mean":0.68411427521587,"rank":1706,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":8346,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10887,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":422,"mean":0.73824228028504,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":343,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":422,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
