SHIP function is thought to require the dual engagement of the BCR and negative regulatory coreceptors as only the latter appear capable of recruiting SHIP from the cytosol to the plasma membrane by virtue of phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs. Here we demonstrate a coreceptor-independent membrane recruitment and function of SHIP in B cells. In the absence of coreceptor ligation, SHIP translocates to sites of BCR activation through a concerted action of the protein adaptor unit Dok-3\/Grb2 and phosphorylated BCR signaling components. Our data reveal auto-inhibitory SHIP activation by the activated BCR and suggest an unexpected negative-regulatory capacity of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs in Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2.
