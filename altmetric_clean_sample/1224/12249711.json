Additionally, they affect morbidity. An estimation of human mortality and morbidity due to the increased concentrations of PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 between the years 2005-2013 was performed for the city of Krak\u00f3w, Poland. For this purpose the Air Quality Health Impact Assessment Tool (AirQ) software was successfully applied.\nThe Air Quality Health Impact Assessment Tool was used for the calculation of the total, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality as well as hospital admissions related to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Data on concentrations of PM10, PM2.5 and NO2, which was obtained from the website of the Voivodeship Inspectorate for Environmental Protection (WIOS) in Krak\u00f3w, was used in this study.\nTotal mortality due to exposure to PM10 in 2005 was found to be 41 deaths per 100 000 and dropped to 30 deaths per 100 000 in 2013. Cardiovascular mortality was 2 times lower than the total mortality. However, hospital admissions due to respiratory diseases were more than an order of magnitude higher than the respiratory mortality.\nThe calculated total mortality due to PM2.5 was higher than that due to PM10. Air pollution was determined to have a significant effect on human health. The values obtained by the use of the AirQ software for the city of Krak\u00f3w imply that exposure to polluted air can result in serious health problems.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b84","authors":["Samek, Lucyna"],"doi":"10.13075\/ijomeh.1896.00560","first_seen_on":"2016-09-28T00:29:44+00:00","issns":["1896-494X","1232-1087"],"issue":"3","journal":"International Journal of Occupational Medicine & Environmental Health (Instytut Medycyny Pracy im.
