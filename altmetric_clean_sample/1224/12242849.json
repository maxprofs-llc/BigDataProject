We have previously demonstrated the utility of both data-driven and mechanistic models in settings of traumatic injury. We hypothesized that differential dynamic inflammation programs characterize TBI survivors vs. non-survivors, and sought to leverage computational modeling to derive novel insights into this life\/death bifurcation. Thirteen inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were determined using Luminex\u2122 in serial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 31 TBI patients over 5 days. In this cohort, 5 were non-survivors (Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS] score = 1) and 26 were survivors (GOS > 1). A Pearson correlation analysis of initial injury (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS]) vs. GOS suggested that survivors and non-survivors had distinct clinical response trajectories to injury. Statistically significant differences in interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-13, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) were observed between TBI survivors vs. non-survivors over 5 days. Principal Component Analysis and Dynamic Bayesian Network inference suggested differential roles of chemokines, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-10, based upon which an ordinary differential equation model of TBI was generated. This model was calibrated separately to the time course data of TBI survivors vs. non-survivors as a function of initial GCS. Analysis of parameter values in ensembles of simulations from these models suggested differences in microglial and damage responses in TBI survivors vs. non-survivors. These studies suggest the utility of combined data-driven and mechanistic models in the context of human TBI.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc18","authors":["Abboud, Andrew","Mi, Qi","Puccio, Ava","Okonkwo, David","Buliga, Marius","Constantine, Gregory","Vodovotz, Yoram","Andrew Abboud","Qi Mi","Ava Puccio","David Okonkwo","Marius Buliga","Gregory Constantine","Yoram Vodovotz"],"doi":"10.3389\/fphar.2016.00342","first_seen_on":"2016-09-27T15:35:47+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms"],"issns":["1663-9812"],"journal":"Frontiers in Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1501248026,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fphar.2016.00342\/full?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fphar.2016.00342\/full","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5037938\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fphar.2016.00342\/pdf","pmid":"27729864","pubdate":"2016-09-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Inflammation Following Traumatic Brain Injury in Humans: Insights from Data-Driven and Mechanistic Models into Survival and Death","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inflammation-following-traumatic-brain-injury-humans-insights-datadriven-mechanistic-models-survival"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":2.5,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8286032,"mean":6.9859461464656,"rank":3373856,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4853428,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8286032,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251403,"mean":12.680811457347,"rank":95598,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":153809,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251403,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1981,"mean":3.5387232323232,"rank":343,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":1622,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1981,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150,"mean":9.8584295302013,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
