The presence of lupus retinopathy is an accurate guide to the presence of active systemic disease activity.\nA prospective study was conducted looking at 91 established cases of systemic lupus erythematosus to evaluate lupus retinopathy. The patients were divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of lupus retinopathy, and a comparison of clinical and laboratory findings between two groups was done. Among 91 SLE patients, 5 were male and 86 were female; of which, 85 (93.4\u00a0%) were outpatients and 6 (6.6\u00a0%) were inpatients. Lupus retinopathy was found in 13 eyes of 11 cases out of 91 cases (12.1\u00a0%). Among these 13 eyes with lupus retinopathy, 61.5\u00a0% had mild type of lupus retinopathy, 15.4\u00a0% had moderate type, and 23.1\u00a0% had severe lupus retinopathy. The mean age of the cases at ophthalmological examination with and without retinopathy was 30.4 and 31.9\u00a0years, respectively. The mean serum creatinine level was 190.4\u00a0\u03bcmol\/l which was higher than in the patients without retinopathy (96.2\u00a0\u03bcmol\/l). The mean ESR in patients with retinopathy was higher than without retinopathy (34.2 vs. 32). Similarly, the mean platelet count in SLE patients with retinopathy was 154,245\/\u03bcl and in SLE patients without retinopathy was 135,828\/\u03bcl.\nRetinal lesions in SLE patients are of critical importance, both visually and prognostically.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000085f","authors":["Kharel Sitaula, Ranju","Shah, Dev Narayan","Singh, Divya","Ranju Kharel (Sitaula)","Dev Narayan Shah","Divya Singh"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12348-016-0081-4","first_seen_on":"2016-05-17T18:02:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1869-5760"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Ophthalmic Inflammation and Infection","last_mentioned_on":1482636918,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27174124?utm_content=buffer607e8&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27174124?utm_content=buffer37a55&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/joii-journal.springeropen.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12348-016-0081-4","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27174124?utm_content=buffer04a28&utm_medium=social&utm_source=plus.google.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27174124?utm_content=buffere5f77&utm_medium=social&utm_source=plus.google.com&utm_campaign=buffer","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27174124"],"pmid":"27174124","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","scheme":"springer"}],"title":"Role of lupus retinopathy in systemic lupus erythematosus","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-lupus-retinopathy-systemic-lupus-erythematosus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.55,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8303943,"mean":6.9989642413128,"rank":1038129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7264125,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8303943,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":273642,"mean":11.725731692253,"rank":47926,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":225614,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":273642,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101,"mean":1.77098,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":93,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":2,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":9}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
