There have been concerns about the management of intra-peritoneal spillage, bleeding, and cystobiliary communication (CBC) during laparoscopic surgery for LHC. CBC can exist in 13%-37% of cases of LHC. No randomised studies have compared open versus laparoscopic approach for the treatment of LHC. We specifically analysed the outcomes of laparoscopic treatment of LHC with special reference to associated biliary complications.\nWe analysed our prospectively collected data of patients undergoing laparoscopic treatment of LHC from 2009 to 2016. Patients undergoing open surgery or interventional radiology procedures were not included. Data analysed included demographic profile, investigational parameters, intra-operative findings and postoperative results with special reference to biliary complications and presence\/management of CBC.\nA total of 41 patients underwent laparoscopic treatment of LHC. History of jaundice was present in 5 (12.2%) patients. CBC was documented in 16 (39.02%) patients. In 11 patients, CBC was detected intra-operatively as visible communication, which was suture ligated or clipped. Five patients had occult CBC, detected as bile leak in the post-operative period. The leak resolved spontaneously in 7 patients and with biliary stenting in 2 patients. Only one patient had a persistent biliary leak. Postoperative bile leak was more common in patients with raised alkaline phosphatase. No statistically significant association was seen with size or location of the cyst, number of cysts and World Health Organisation classification.\nLaparoscopic treatment of LHC with associated CBC provides acceptable results.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f61000405e","authors":["Chopra, Nikhil","Gupta, Vivek",", ","Kumar, Saket","Joshi, Pradeep","Gupta, Vishal","Chandra, Abhijit"],"first_seen_on":"2017-09-21T10:23:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0972-9941"],"journal":"Journal of Minimal Access Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1505989420,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28928333?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28928333","pubdate":"2017-09-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Liver hydatid cyst with cystobiliary communication: Laparoscopic surgery remains an effective option.","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":7297866,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116621,"mean":11.837384925399,"rank":95178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116621,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115,"mean":0.89956140350877,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/statuses\/910811760315187202","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26397740],"posted_on":"2017-09-21T10:23:40+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":379},"tweet_id":"910811760315187202"}]}}
