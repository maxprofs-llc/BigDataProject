There is limited literature on this topic and hence, we wish to briefly describe management of two cases at our institution and their outcomes.\nWe retrospectively identified two patients with immune-mediated AD after SCT from our database. Immune-mediated AD was defined as AD secondary to an immune-mediated etiology without an alternative cause and responding to immunosuppression.\nThe first case is of a 32-year-old man with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent double umbilical cord allogeneic SCT. The second patient was a 51-year-old woman with secondary AML who underwent matched-related donor allogeneic SCT. Both underwent an extensive work-up for an underlying etiology prior to treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).\nAD after SCT is a rare yet significant clinical entity. A work-up of underlying etiology should be performed. IVIG is a treatment option for these patients.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef682a83ee09648b4fa0","authors":["Abhishek Mangaonkar","Hassan Al Khateeb","Narjust Duma","Erik K.
