However, current studies show that most women are not following this recommendation. Many studies address the issue of increasing breastfeeding rates, but fewer explore the perspectives and experiences of breastfeeding women. In this article we review the literature and identify common themes in women's breastfeeding experiences. Nurses and other health care providers stand to help or hinder breastfeeding women, and they must be aware of and sensitive to women's personal experiences and perspectives to understand how to best promote and support women in their attempts to meet their breastfeeding goals.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5a23cf058f6100052af","authors":["Alicia D.
