Defects in this transport pathway have been associated with neurodegenerative disorders. While the TIM22 complex is well studied in baker's yeast, very little is known about the mammalian TIM22 complex. Using immunoprecipitation, we purified the human carrier translocase and identified a mitochondrial inner membrane protein TIM29 as a novel component, specific to metazoa. We show that TIM29 is a constituent of the 440 kDa TIM22 complex and interacts with oxidized TIM22. Our analyses demonstrate that TIM29 is required for the structural integrity of the TIM22 complex and for import of substrate proteins by the carrier translocase.
