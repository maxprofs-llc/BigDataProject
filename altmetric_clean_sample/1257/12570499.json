Because of the very high efficacy of piroxicam and its increasing use in the treatment of carcinomas in dogs and cats, there is a need for acute toxicity study of piroxicam in monogastric animals and its potential for causing secondary poisoning in puppies. Piroxicam manufactured by Shanxi Federal Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd. was used for this study. Revised up-and-down procedure was used for the estimation of median lethal dose in mouse (259.4 \u00b1 51.9 mg\/kg), rat (259.4 \u00b1 69.6 mg\/kg), rabbit (707.5 \u00b1 130.8 mg\/kg), cat (437.5 \u00b1 128.1 mg\/kg), guinea pig (218.7 \u00b1 64.1 mg\/kg), monkey (733.3 \u00b1 83.3 mg\/kg), broiler (285.3 \u00b1 62.5 mg\/kg), hen (638.3 \u00b1 115.4 mg\/kg), turkey (707.5 \u00b1 130.8 mg\/kg), pigeon (375 \u00b1 55.9 mg\/kg), and duck (311.3 \u00b1 46.6 mg\/kg). The acute toxicity signs of piroxicam at doses 207.5 mg\/kg and above observed in the animals are torticollis, opisthotonos, somnolence, lethargy, diarrhea, gastroenteritis, generalized internal bleeding, anemia, congestion of the lung and liver, flaccid paralysis, cheesy lung, urinary incontinence, engorged urinary bladder, convulsive jerking of the limbs, lying in ventral recumbency, gasping for air, roaring, and death. Three out of six puppies died after being fed the carcasses of poisoned turkey, duck, and hen administered piroxicam at doses of 1000, 415, and 1000 mg\/kg, respectively. White flaky cheesy materials observed in turkeys were also observed in the gastrointestinal content of the puppies. Paleness of carcasses, watery crop content, dryness of pericardium, gastroenteritis, intestinal perforation, and whitish pericardium were observed in broilers. There were effusions in thoracic and abdominal cavities as seen in all other carcasses poisoned primarily by piroxicam. Administration of atropine (0.02 mg\/kg) led to survival of the remaining puppies. In conclusion, piroxicam is very to moderately toxic in monogastric animals.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90c3cf058f61000caf0","authors":["Saganuwan Alhaji Saganuwan","Orinya Agbaji Orinya"],"doi":"10.4137\/jen.s40144","first_seen_on":"2016-10-11T20:48:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1179-0695"],"journal":"Journal of experimental neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1476223810,"links":["http:\/\/www.la-press.com\/toxico-neurological-effects-of-piroxicam-in-monogastric-animals-article-a5957?source=rss&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/www.la-press.com\/toxico-neurological-effects-of-piroxicam-in-monogastric-animals-article-a5957"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.la-press.com\/redirect_file.php?fileId=7911&filename=5957-JEN-Toxico-Neurological-Effects-of-Piroxicam-in-Monogastric-Animals.pdf&fileType=pdf","pmid":"27773993","pubdate":"2016-10-11T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"121","title":"Toxico-Neurological Effects of Piroxicam in Monogastric Animals","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/toxiconeurological-effects-piroxicam-monogastric-animals"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7609473,"mean":6.5531932872566,"rank":3714989,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3701590,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7609473,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241375,"mean":12.432871701177,"rank":122013,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":110541,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241375,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":3.0777777777778,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":5.22,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
