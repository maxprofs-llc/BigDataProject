However, little is known about lincRNAs in marine invertebrates. Here, we presented the first identification and characterization of lincRNAs in the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas). We developed a pipeline and identified 11,668 lincRNAs in C. gigas based on RNA-Seq resources available. These lincRNAs exhibited many common characteristics with vertebrate lincRNAs: relatively short length, low exon numbers, low expression, and low sequence conservation. 1,175 lincRNAs were expressed in a tissue-specific manner, with 35.2% preferentially expressed in male gonad. 776 lincRNAs were specifically expressed in juvenile during different developmental stages. In addition, 47 lincRNAs were found to be potentially related to oyster settlement and metamorphosis. Such diverse temporal and spatial patterns of expression suggest that these lincRNAs might function in cell differentiation during early development, as well as sex differentiation and reproduction. Based on a co-expression network analysis, five lincRNAs were detected that have an expression correlation with key hub genes in four modules significantly correlated with larval development. Our study provides the first large-scale identification of lincRNAs in molluscs and offers new insights into potential functions of lincRNAs in marine invertebrates.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Yu, Hong","Zhao, Xuelin","Li, Qi","Hong Yu","Xuelin Zhao","Qi Li"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep20796","first_seen_on":"2016-02-11T11:10:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1457972076,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26861843?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26861843?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep20796","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/srep20796","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26861843","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26861843#cm26861843_14293"],"pmid":"26861843","pubdate":"2016-02-11T22:01:00+00:00","subjects":["science"],"title":"Genome-wide identification and characterization of long intergenic noncoding RNAs and their potential association with larval development in the Pacific oyster.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genomewide-identification-characterization-long-intergenic-noncoding-rnas-potential-association-larv"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7391940,"mean":6.4229753378604,"rank":1443828,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":5937508,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7391940,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":322663,"mean":9.6341499091925,"rank":78580,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":243721,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":322663,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27389,"mean":14.659345625822,"rank":8037,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":19302,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27389,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2913,"mean":17.084195054945,"rank":904,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":2005,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2913,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":8}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
