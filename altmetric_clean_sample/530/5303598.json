Due to this remarkable anisotropy they represent a unique opportunity to realize effective bulk meta-structure with extraordinary optical properties in the visible range. A simultaneous dielectric singularity in the in plane permittivity, with respect to the propagation direction, has to lead to a complete sign inversion of the same permittivity for that specific visible frequency. Such a drastic phase change has been theoretically highlighted in the past as the major challenge to be overcome in order to unlock many remarkable optical properties not present artificial optical systems. In this paper we experimentally demonstrate the realization of a metal-dielectric multilayer structure showing an inversion point of coexisting anisotropies at a specified wavelength in the visible range, rising from the particular design and fabrication process. Theoretical models and numerical simulations are in very good agreement with experimental data. Ellipsometrical experiments and optical modeling demonstrate the drastic type I\/type II transition. Supercollimation effect has been achieved at the inversion point of the coexisting extreme anisotropies, whereas at the epsilon near zero and pole frequency the perfect lens behavior has been observed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["V.
