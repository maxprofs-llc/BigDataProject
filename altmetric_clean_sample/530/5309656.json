About 90% of adults were found to be persistently infected with EBV and this infection is responsible for Burkitt lymphoma (BL), extranodal NK\/T cell lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), acquired Immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated lymphoma, and a portion of diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL). EBV-positive DLBCL in the elderly, a disease recognized in Japan, is described in the WHO classification as a new category of DLBCLs. Clinical studies of DLBCLs have since accumulated. We herein describe our clinicopathological study of EBV-positive DLBCL in the elderly in the rituximab era, and review EBV-positive B cell lymphoma cases. A potentially promising novel therapy for EBV-positive B cell lymphoma, anti-PD-1 antibody, is then introduced. Finally, we briefly discuss our unpublished study of EBV-positive B cell lymphoma and its microenvironment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9283cf058f61000dd1e","authors":["Sato, Ai","Yamakawa, Natsuko","Kotani, Ai"],"doi":"10.11406\/rinketsu.57.3","first_seen_on":"2016-02-11T11:07:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0485-1439"],"issue":"1","journal":"[Rinsh\u014d ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology","last_mentioned_on":1470285131,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26861096?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26861096?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26861096","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Pathogenesis and novel therapy for EBV-related B-cell lymphoma.","type":"article","volume":"57","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pathogenesis-novel-therapy-ebvrelated-bcell-lymphoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8166192,"mean":6.9129712202356,"rank":6202335,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1098588,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8166192,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":332772,"mean":9.822520345823,"rank":232054,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":51946,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":332772,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187,"mean":1.081935483871,"rank":80,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":68,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":0.666,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
