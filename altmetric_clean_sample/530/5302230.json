The white line-inducing principle (WLIP) is a member of the viscosin group featuring a Glu2 amino acid. Recently, a total synthesis of pseudodesmin A - the Gln2 counterpart of WLIP - was described, and we here expand this route to Glu2 containing CLPs. We report the first total synthesis of WLIP and at the same time establish that the Gln2 to Glu2 substitution has an adverse impact on the crude purity and overall yield. A comparative study of different CLP analogues reveals the importance of the nature of the Glx2 protecting group in determining these outcomes. Replacement of the conventional tBu protecting group by the larger benzyl group for the Glu residue in our synthesis strategy indeed resulted in an improved conversion. Next to achieving the first WLIP total synthesis, we thus show the importance of a careful choice of protecting groups for the success of this type of solid-phase synthesis approaches towards CLPs.
