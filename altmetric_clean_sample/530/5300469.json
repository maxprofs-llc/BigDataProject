First, an advanced light-pulse spectro-temporal shaping device optimally precompensates for linear and nonlinear distortions occurring during propagation within the endoscopic fiber. This enables the delivery of sub-40-fs duration infrared excitation pulses at the output of 5\u2009meters of fiber. Second, the endoscopic fiber is a custom-made double-clad polarization-maintaining photonic crystal fiber specifically designed to optimize the imaging resolution and the intrinsic luminescence backward collection. Third, a miniaturized fiber-scanner of 2.2\u2009mm outer diameter allows simultaneous second harmonic generation (SHG) and two-photon excited autofluorescence (TPEF) imaging at 8 frames per second. This microendoscope's transverse and axial resolutions amount respectively to 0.8\u2009\u03bcm and 12\u2009\u03bcm, with a field-of-view as large as 450\u2009\u03bcm. This microendoscope's unprecedented capabilities are validated during label-free imaging, ex vivo on various fixed human tissue samples, and in vivo on an anesthetized mouse kidney demonstrating an imaging penetration depth greater than 300\u2009\u03bcm below the surface of the organ. The results reported in this manuscript confirm that nonlinear microendoscopy can become a valuable clinical tool for real-time in situ assessment of pathological states.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Guillaume Ducourthial","Pierre Leclerc","Tigran Mansuryan","Marc Fabert","Julien Brevier","R\u00e9mi Habert","Flavie Braud","Renaud Batrin","Christine Vever-Bizet","Genevi\u00e8ve Bourg-Heckly","Luc Thiberville","Anne Druilhe","Alexandre Kudlinski","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Louradour"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep18303","first_seen_on":"2016-02-10T15:42:22+00:00","issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1455118928,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/srep18303"],"pmcid":"PMC4682136","pmid":"26673905","pubdate":"2015-12-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multiphoton microscopy","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Biophotonics","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Development of a real-time flexible multiphoton microendoscope for label-free imaging in a live animal","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-realtime-flexible-multiphoton-microendoscope-labelfree-imaging-live-animal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7168681,"mean":6.3131530881527,"rank":964258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6142472,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7168681,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320521,"mean":9.5630160364405,"rank":58205,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":258410,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320521,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26090,"mean":14.515678331864,"rank":6115,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":19689,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26090,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2912,"mean":17.039389900378,"rank":730,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":2139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2912,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
