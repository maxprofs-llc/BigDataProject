The coding region for the RodA protein was 1,110 base pairs in length. Two plasmids, carrying a rodA-lacZ gene fusion with and without the pbpA promoter upstream of the gene fusion, were constructed. On the basis of the difference between the expression levels of the beta-galactosidase activity dependent on and independent of the pbpA promoter, we concluded that the pbpA and rodA genes constitute a single transcriptional unit called the rodA operon.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cba","authors":["Matsuzawa, H","Asoh, S","Kunai, K","Muraiso, K","Takasuga, A","Ohta, T","H Matsuzawa","S Asoh","K Kunai","K Muraiso","A Takasuga","T Ohta"],"first_seen_on":"2016-02-10T21:19:31+00:00","issns":["0021-9193"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Bacteriology","last_mentioned_on":1455139162,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2644207","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC209621"],"pmcid":"PMC209621","pmid":"2644207","pubdate":"1989-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["bacteriology"],"title":"Nucleotide sequence of the rodA gene, responsible for the rod shape of Escherichia coli: rodA and the pbpA gene, encoding penicillin-binding protein 2, constitute the rodA operon.","type":"article","volume":"171","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nucleotide-sequence-roda-gene-responsible-rod-shape-escherichia-coli-roda-pbpa-gene-encoding-penicil"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7168681,"mean":6.3131530881527,"rank":1695547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4580984,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7168681,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320521,"mean":9.5630119805313,"rank":95316,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":219192,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320521,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3969,"mean":3.2481118951613,"rank":746,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":1629,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3969,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86,"mean":4.2288470588235,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":44,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
