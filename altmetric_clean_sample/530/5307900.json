The polarization of the cavity soliton is not the one of the optical injection as it acquires a distinct ellipticity. These experimental results are qualitatively reproduced by the spin-flip VCSEL model. Our findings open the road to polarization multiplexing when using cavity solitons in broad-area lasers as pixels in information technology.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Etienne Averlant","Mustapha Tlidi","Hugo Thienpont","Thorsten Ackemann","Krassimir Panajotov","Averlant, Etienne","Tlidi, Mustapha","Thienpont, Hugo","Ackemann, Thorsten","Panajotov, Krassimir"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep20428","first_seen_on":"2016-02-11T04:36:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1456194903,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep20428","http:\/\/strathprints.strath.ac.uk\/55648\/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26847004","pubdate":"2016-02-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nonlinear optics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Solitons","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"20428","subjects":["science"],"title":"Vector cavity solitons in broad area Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Lasers","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep20428","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vector-cavity-solitons-broad-area-verticalcavity-surfaceemitting-lasers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7252957,"mean":6.3649994636635,"rank":3147193,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4034283,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7252957,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320889,"mean":9.612612905437,"rank":133381,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":182084,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320889,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26574,"mean":14.576192601513,"rank":12510,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":13542,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26574,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2907,"mean":17.091446662078,"rank":1405,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1457,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2907,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
