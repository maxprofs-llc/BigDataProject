Here, constructs for single-domain intrabodies consisting of variable regions derived from mouse monoclonal antibodies against HCV Core were established. Expressed single-domain intrabodies were shown to bind to the HCV Core, and inhibit the growth of cell culture-produced HCV derived from JFH-1 (genotype 2a) and TH (genotype 1b)\/JFH-1 chimera. Adenovirus vectors expressing intrabodies were also capable of reducing HCV propagation. Intrabody expression did not affect viral entry or genome replication of single-round infectious trans-complemented HCV particles. However, intrabody expression reduced intracellular and extracellular infectious titers in CD81-defective Huh7-25 cells transfected with HCV genome, suggesting that these intrabodies impair HCV assembly. Furthermore, intrabody expression suppressed HCV Core-induced NF-\u03baB promoter activity. These intrabodies may therefore serve as tools for elucidating the role of Core in HCV pathogenesis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c9c","authors":["Suzuki, Ryosuke","Saito, Kenji","Matsuda, Mami","Sato, Mitsuru","Kanegae, Yumi","Shi, Guoli","Watashi, Koichi","Aizaki, Hideki","Chiba, Joe","Saito, Izumu","Wakita, Takaji","Suzuki, Tetsuro"],"doi":"10.1099\/jgv.0.000423","endpage":"892","first_seen_on":"2016-02-11T11:11:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1465-2099","0022-1317"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of General Virology","last_mentioned_on":1472105589,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26861864?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26861864?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26861864","pubdate":"2016-02-11T22:01:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"887","title":"Single-domain Intrabodies against HCV Core Inhibit Viral Propagation and Core-induced NF-\u03baB Activation.","type":"article","volume":"97","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/singledomain-intrabodies-against-hepatitis-c-virus-core-inhibit-viral-propagation-coreinduced-nf%CE%BAb-a"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8276988,"mean":6.9824426364262,"rank":5984477,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1997512,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8276988,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":334032,"mean":9.842022638617,"rank":213257,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":101389,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":334032,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1808,"mean":3.0896425013835,"rank":1303,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":445,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1808,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":1.8806896551724,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
