The goal is to use the high thermodynamic efficiency of anaerobic fermentation to convert organic biomass or organic wastes into valuable biochemicals that can be extracted. Several liter-scale studies have been completed and a first pilot-plant study is underway. However, the underlying microbial pathways are not always well understood. In addition, an interdisciplinary approach with knowledge from fields ranging from microbiology and chemical separations to biochemistry and environmental engineering is required. To bring together research from different fields, we reviewed the literature starting with the microbiology and ending with the bioprocess engineering studies that already have been performed. Because understanding the microbial pathways is so important to predict and steer performance, we delved into a stoichiometric and thermodynamic model that sheds light on the effect of substrate ratios and environmental conditions on product formation. Finally, we ended with an outlook.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027ef","authors":["Largus T.
