The outcome of AKI needing CRRT in elderly patients is known to be poor. However, the definitions of elderly used in the previous literatures were diverse and, there were few data that compared the long-term mortality rates of these patients with middle aged patients. This study was aimed to evaluate this issue.\nThis study was a single-center, retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent CRRT from January 2013 to December 2015. The patients were divided into the following four age cohorts: middle-aged (55-64), young-old (65-74), middle-old (75-84), and old-old (\u226585). The short- and long-term mortality rates for each age cohort were compared.\nA total of 562 patients met the inclusion criteria. The short-term mortality rate was 57.3% in the entire cohort. Compared with the middle-aged cohort, the middle-old cohort (HR 1.48 (1.09-2.02), p = 0.012) and the old-old cohort (HR 2.33 (1.30-4.19), p = 0.005) showed an increased short-term mortality rate along with an increased SOFA score, acidemia and a prolonged prothrombin time. When we analyzed the long-term mortality rate of the 238 survived patients, the middle-old cohort (HR 3.76 (1.84-7.68), p<0.001), the old-old cohort (HR 4.40(1.20-16.10), p = 0.025), a lower BMI, the presence of liver cirrhosis, the presence of congestive heart failure and a history of sepsis were independent risk factors for the prediction of long-term mortality.\nCompared with the middle-aged cohort, the middle-old and the old-old cohort showed an increased short-term and long-term mortality rate. However, in the young-old cohort, neither the short-term nor the long-term mortality rate was increased.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Harin Rhee","Keum Sook Jang","Jong Man Park","Jin Suk Kang","Na Kyoung Hwang","Il Young Kim","Sang Heon Song","Eun Young Seong","Dong Won Lee","Soo Bong Lee","Ihm Soo Kwak"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0167067","first_seen_on":"2016-11-22T18:46:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"11","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1481311584,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0167067","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0167067"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0167067&type=printable","pmid":"27875571","pubdate":"2016-11-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0167067","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Short- and Long-Term Mortality Rates of Elderly Acute Kidney Injury Patients Who Underwent Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0167067","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/short-longterm-mortality-rates-elderly-acute-kidney-injury-patients-underwent-continuous-renal-repla-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7866440,"mean":6.6628832942016,"rank":3657572,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":4033045,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7866440,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252264,"mean":12.159942694727,"rank":118492,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":127199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252264,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110717,"mean":10.310219787565,"rank":53090,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":53165,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110717,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3828,"mean":11.637675986412,"rank":1853,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":1826,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3828,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
