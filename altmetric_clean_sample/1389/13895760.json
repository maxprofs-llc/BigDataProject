There are various dental notations systems for the primary and permanent dentition. The most popular are the Zsigmondy-Palmer system, the Universal Numbering System, and the FDI system. Others includes the Victor Haderup system, the Woelfel system, and the MICAP system. The majority of dental notations are focused on permanent teeth and are modified for primary teeth, even though the latter erupt before the permanent dentition.\nAdvantages and disadvantages of notations for primary dentition are discussed and compared to a new alphanumeric system for primary teeth which is considered simple and convenient.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f610007362","authors":["Havale, R","Sheetal, B S","Patil, R","Hemant Kumar, R","Anegundi, R T","Inushekar, K R"],"first_seen_on":"2016-11-22T16:09:52+00:00","issns":["1591-996X"],"issue":"2","journal":"European Journal of Paediatric Dentistry: Journal of the Italian Society of Paediatric Dentistry","last_mentioned_on":1479831708,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26147826"],"pmid":"26147826","pubdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["dentistry","pediatrics"],"title":"Dental notation for primary teeth: a review and suggestion of a novel system.","type":"article","volume":"16"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7724913,"mean":6.6254088328702,"rank":1882860,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4814890,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7724913,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":247437,"mean":12.191143309785,"rank":83892,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":160058,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":247437,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":2.078813559322,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Dental anatomy","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=750974307#altmetric_citation_00fec336-b0ab-441e-b1fa-633b87d6f178","license":"public","citation_ids":[13895760],"posted_on":"2016-11-22T16:21:48+00:00","summary":"Dental anatomy is a field of anatomy dedicated to the study of human tooth structures.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=9099027","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Deleet","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Deleet"}},{"title":"Palmer notation","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=750972929#altmetric_citation_63219188-2256-4442-975f-522724d7f0c7","license":"public","citation_ids":[13895760],"posted_on":"2016-11-22T16:09:47+00:00","summary":"Palmer notation (named after Ohio dentist Dr. Corydon Palmer) is a system used by dentists to associate information to a specific tooth.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=7463394","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Deleet","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Deleet"}}]}}
