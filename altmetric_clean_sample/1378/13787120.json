Antiplatelet drug resistance, especially to clopidogrel, is a multifactorial phenomenon that affects a large number of ACS patients. The genetic contribution to this drug response is not fully elucidated. We investigated the relationship of ABC-type efflux subfamily C member 3 (ABCC3) polymorphisms and mRNA expression with plasma concentrations of clopidogrel, salicylic acid (SA), and a carboxylic acid metabolite (CAM). Clopidogrel, CAM, and SA plasma concentrations were measured simultaneously by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS\/MS) from 83 ACS patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. ABCC3 (rs757421, rs733392, and rs739923) and CYP2C19*2 (rs4244285) polymorphisms as well as mRNA expression were evaluated. A positive correlation was found between CAM concentrations and ABCC3 mRNA expression (r = 0.494, P < 0.0001). Patients carrying genotype AA (rs757421 variant) had higher CAM concentrations and ABCC3 mRNA expression as compared to those of GG + GA carriers (P = 0.017). A multiple linear regression analysis revealed that ABCC3 mRNA expression (P = 0.017), rs757421 AA genotype (P = 0.001), blood collection time (BCT; P = 0.018), and clopidogrel dose (P = 0.001) contributed to the concentration of CAM. No associations were observed for the CYP2C19*2 polymorphism. These results suggest that up-regulation of ABCC3 mRNA expression leads to increased plasma CAM levels through MRP3-mediated cell efflux. The ABCC3 rs757421 polymorphism may contribute to gene expression. Therefore, ABCC3 may be a potential biomarker for the response to clopidogrel. This article is protected by copyright.
