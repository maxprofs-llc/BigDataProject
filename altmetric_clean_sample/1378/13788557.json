Patients over the age of 40 years who received injections for AMD (n = 76) or DME (n = 55) were included. Patients were grouped according to indication as well as number of injections received (1-3, 4-6, 7-9, or 10+ injections). IOP measurements were then placed into time points (0-6, 6-12, 12-18, 18-24, or 24+ months) and compared to the preinjection average IOP.\nFor patients with DME, average preinjection IOP was 15.7 mmHg. At 24+ months after injection, the average IOP was 15.2 (P = 0.68) for patients receiving 1-3 injections, 16.8 (P = 0.23) for 4-6 injections, and 14.4 (P = 0.66) for 7-9 injections. For patients with AMD, average initial IOP was 15.6 mmHg. At 24+ months after injection, the average IOP was 12.6 (P = 0.97) for 1-3 injections, 14.9 (P = 0.96) for 4-6 injections, 14.8 (P = 0.84) for 7-9 injections, and 15.7 (P = 0.56) for 10+ injections.\nThere was no increase in IOP over time for AMD or DME patients, regardless of how many injections they received. For patients receiving unilateral injections, there was no increase in IOP in the injected eye when compared to the noninjected eye.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002aaf","authors":["Nariani","Ashiyana Nariani","Blake Williams","Seenu M Hariprasad","Nariani, Ashiyana","Williams, Blake","Hariprasad, Seenu M"],"doi":"10.4103\/0301-4738.194329","first_seen_on":"2016-11-18T10:34:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0301-4738","1998-3689"],"issue":"9","journal":"Indian Journal of Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1479465295,"links":["http:\/\/www.ijo.in\/article.asp?issn=0301-4738%3Byear%3D2016%3Bvolume%3D64%3Bissue%3D9%3Bspage%3D643%3Bepage%3D647%3Baulast%3DNariani#.WC7Y67X_-s8.twitter","http:\/\/www.ijo.in\/article.asp?issn=0301-4738;year=2016;volume=64;issue=9;spage=643;epage=647;aulast=Nariani#.WC7ZPspDrWw.linkedin"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ijo.in\/article.asp?issn=0301-4738;year=2016;volume=64;issue=9;spage=643;epage=647;aulast=Nariani;type=2","pmid":"27853011","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medknow Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"643","subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Long-term effect of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections on intraocular pressure","type":"article","volume":"64","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/longterm-effect-antivascular-endothelial-growth-factor-injections-intraocular-pressure-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7711702,"mean":6.6147835493025,"rank":3995395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2168194,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7711702,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248043,"mean":12.148977447367,"rank":135586,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":88947,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248043,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":639,"mean":1.0098432601881,"rank":141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":454,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":639,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.79166666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/rocatanho\/statuses\/799561428885786624","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13788557],"posted_on":"2016-11-18T10:34:34+00:00","author":{"name":"rodolfo catanho","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/418701421031088129\/F1CIU3nb_normal.jpeg","description":"internist.  proudly friend of my friends.
