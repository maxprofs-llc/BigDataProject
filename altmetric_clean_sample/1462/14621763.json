The objectives are to determine if the Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and the Frailty Index (FI) predict death over a five-year interval after accounting for the effect of the other; and if there is an interaction in this effect.\nAn analysis of an existing prospective cohort study of 1,751 community living older adults followed over a five-year time frame. Age, gender, and education were self-reported. The predictor variables were the FI - a measure of frailty based on the \"Accumulation of Deficits\" model of frailty; and the MMSE. Cox proportional hazards models were constructed for the outcome of time to death.\nThe unadjusted Hazard Ratio (HR) (95% CI) for mortality was 2.17 (1.69, 2.80) for those who were only cognitively impaired, 2.02 (1.53, 2.68) for those who were only frail, and 3.57 (2.75, 4.62) for those who were both frail and cognitively impaired with the reference group of those who were neither frail nor cognitively impaired. Adjusted for age, gender, and education, the HR (95% CI) was 1.49 (1.13. 1.95) for those who were only cognitively impaired, 1.81 (1.35, 2.41) for those who were only frail, and 2.28 (1.69, 3.09) for those who were both frail and cognitively impaired.\nBoth frailty and cognitive impairment are predictors of mortality and the effect is cumulative. There was no interaction in this effect.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e83cf058f6100059c1","authors":["St John, Philip D","Tyas, Suzanne L","Griffith, Lauren E","Menec, Verena"],"doi":"10.1017\/s1041610216002088","endpage":"9","first_seen_on":"2016-12-09T23:20:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1741-203X","1041-6102"],"journal":"International Psychogeriatrics","last_mentioned_on":1481325405,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27903307"],"pmid":"27903307","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["geriatrics","psychiatry"],"title":"The cumulative effect of frailty and cognition on mortality \u2013 results of a prospective cohort study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cumulative-effect-frailty-cognition-mortality-results-prospective-cohort-study-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7866440,"mean":6.6628832942016,"rank":1089864,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6705821,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7866440,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251506,"mean":12.28666948172,"rank":52305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":195687,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251506,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1250,"mean":3.9680496397118,"rank":169,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":1044,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1250,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":10.522928571429,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"The cumulative effect of frailty and cognition on mortality - results of a prospective cohort study.","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=28879240239&p=1pl&v=1&x=C_05fAygvNiJ3_UWX4KLLA","license":"public","citation_ids":[14621763],"posted_on":"2016-12-09T23:16:45+00:00","summary":".
