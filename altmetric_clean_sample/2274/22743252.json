Forty-one patients (39%) showed anti-tTG >10 times normal values, positive EMA and positive HLA-DQ2\/DQ8 (positive TT). All of them had a diagnosis of CD, therefore there were no false positive cases. Sixty-four patients were negative for the TT. In eight cases, CD was ruled out and these were considered true negative cases. In the remaining 56 negative TT patients, intestinal biopsy confirmed CD diagnosis and they were considered false negatives. Based on these results, specificity for the TT was 100% and sensitivity was 42.3%.\nOn the basis of the present study, diagnosis of CD can be reliably performed without a duodenal biopsy in children with only extra-intestinal symptoms.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000842","authors":["Bozzola, Mauro","Meazza, Cristina","Gertosio, Chiara","Pagani, Sara","Larizza, Daniela","Calcaterra, Valeria","Luinetti, Ombretta","Farello, Giovanni","Tinelli, Carmine","Iughetti, Lorenzo","Mauro Bozzola","Cristina Meazza","Chiara Gertosio","Sara Pagani","Daniela Larizza","Valeria Calcaterra","Ombretta Luinetti","Giovanni Farello","Carmine Tinelli","Lorenzo Iughetti"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13052-017-0377-5","first_seen_on":"2017-07-27T16:38:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1824-7288"],"issue":"1","journal":"Italian Journal of Pediatrics","last_mentioned_on":1501877413,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28709446","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/s13052-017-0377-5"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/ijponline.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s13052-017-0377-5?site=ijponline.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"28709446","pubdate":"2017-07-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"59","subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Omitting duodenal biopsy in children with suspected celiac disease and extra-intestinal symptoms","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/omitting-duodenal-biopsy-children-suspected-celiac-disease-extraintestinal-symptoms"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":1.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8320311,"mean":7.0122256031246,"rank":4189787,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3917270,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8320311,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189826,"mean":12.089486895825,"rank":94497,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":86882,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189826,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":355,"mean":2.8641468926554,"rank":130,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":203,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":355,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":12.3,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Omitting duodenal biopsy in children with suspected celiac disease and extra-intestinal symptoms. - PubMed - NCBI","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1394635727238501&id=451747168194033","license":"public","citation_ids":[22743252,22743252],"posted_on":"2017-07-26T12:36:17+00:00","summary":"More to come about this Italian study but on first glance it looks like a lot of the children with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease did not have sky-high celiac antibody levels prior to diagnosis...https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28709446","author":{"name":"The Patient Celiac","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/451747168194033","facebook_wall_name":"The Patient Celiac","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/451747168194033\/picture","id_on_source":"451747168194033"}},{"title":"Primal Healing Rhythms","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1551603798193982&id=475424422478597","license":"public","citation_ids":[22743252],"posted_on":"2017-07-29T01:59:35+00:00","summary":"From a colleague of mine who is also a nurse...\n\n\"I've said it a thousand times.
