Hence, understanding the structural changes responsible for cognitive decline in PD is essential for early diagnosis and to offer effective treatment. In this review, we discuss the neuroanatomical changes in major brain structures responsible for cognition in PD. We have included the key findings of various studies to provide up-to-date information for better understanding of pathophysiology of PD, which will help researchers and clinicians in planning and developing new treatment methods for the benefit of PD patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8203cf058f61000bc36","authors":["Prakash","KG Prakash","BM Bannur","Madhavrao D Chavan","K Saniya","Kumar Sai Sailesh","Archana Rajagopalan","Prakash, K G","Bannur, B M","Chavan, Madhavrao D","Saniya, K","Sailesh, Kumar Sai","Rajagopalan, Archana"],"doi":"10.4103\/2231-4040.191416","first_seen_on":"2016-09-30T09:31:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2231-4040"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Advanced Pharmaceutical Technology & Research","last_mentioned_on":1479510905,"links":["http:\/\/www.japtr.org\/article.asp?issn=2231-4040%3Byear%3D2016%3Bvolume%3D7%3Bissue%3D4%3Bspage%3D123%3Bepage%3D126%3Baulast%3DPrakash#.V-4wwAyCGlg.twitter","http:\/\/www.japtr.org\/article.asp?issn=2231-4040;year=2016;volume=7;issue=4;spage=123;epage=126;aulast=Prakash#.V-4wzGzUMsg.linkedin","http:\/\/japtr.org\/article.asp?issn=2231-4040;year=2016;volume=7;issue=4;spage=123;epage=126;aulast=Prakash","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27833890"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.japtr.org\/article.asp?issn=2231-4040;year=2016;volume=7;issue=4;spage=123;epage=126;aulast=Prakash;type=2","pmcid":"PMC5052937","pmid":"27833890","pubdate":"2016-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medknow Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"123","title":"Neuroanatomical changes in Parkinson's disease in relation to cognition: An update","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neuroanatomical-changes-parkinsons-disease-relation-cognition-update"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.5,"score_history":{"1y":10.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7711682,"mean":6.6148164461077,"rank":708091,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":6996818,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7711682,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244451,"mean":12.505605702597,"rank":36556,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":207520,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244451,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":5.9952,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":71,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
