These sensory areas are synaptically linked with one another. The patterns of connectivity and the different submodality input that each area receives suggest that they send different efferent signals to the motor cortex. The projections from area 2 to area 3a and to the motor cortex were studied with retrogradely transported fluorescent tracers. The pattern and distribution of neuronal labeling in area 2 was determined following injections of different tracers into the forelimb regions of area 3a and the motor cortex. The results showed that the projections from area 2 to the two target regions were topographically and somatotopically related. Multiple clusters of motor cortex projection neurons were found in area 2, and these clusters overlapped extensively with clusters of area 3a projection neurons. Although cells labeled with one of the dyes were often in close proximity to cells labeled with the other dye, no double-labeled cells were found. Two different laminar patterns were seen for the two populations of neurons. The projection to area 3a originated from cells located in layers II-III and layers V-VI. The projection to the motor cortex originated from cells spread throughout layers II-IV, but predominantly in layer III. Differences in laminar arrangement of the two populations of cells suggest a directional flow of information processing in the sensorimotor cortex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","authors":["Richard H.
