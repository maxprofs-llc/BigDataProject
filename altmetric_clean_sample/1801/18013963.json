The mechanism of ring opening of macrocyclic compound\u20054 was studied. 5-Amino-2,4,6-trinitro-1,3-dihydroxy-benzene (8) was obtained after the nitration of 6 in KNO3 and concentrated sulfuric acid. The thermal stability, sensitivity, and other detonation performances of 6 or 8 were compared to commercially used 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB) or 1,3,5-trinitrotriazacyclohexane (RDX), respectively. All target compounds were characterized by using single-crystal X-ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry. The sensitivities were determined by using BAM methods (drop-hammer and friction tests). Performance parameters, including heats of formation and detonation properties, were calculated by using Gaussian\u200503 and EXPLO5 v6.01 programs, respectively. It is worth pointing out that compound\u20058 has a remarkable measured density of 2.078\u2005g\u2009cm(-3) at 298\u2005K. In addition, compound\u20058 is more insensitive than RDX (compound\u20058: IS=11\u2005J; RDX: IS=7\u2005J; IS is the impact sensitivity).","altmetric_jid":"53222dc92a83ee27268b45b1","authors":["Zhang, Xingcheng","Xiong, Hualin","Yang, Hongwei","Cheng, Guangbin"],"doi":"10.1002\/open.201600132","first_seen_on":"2017-03-22T15:05:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2191-1363"],"issue":"3","journal":"ChemistryOpen","last_mentioned_on":1490195132,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/open.201600132\/abstract;jsessionid=636BF480AAF48BF23441B44074289B87.f04t04?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+on+Saturday+25th+March+from+07%3A00+GMT+%2F+03%3A00+EDT+%2F+15%3A00+SGT+for+4+hours+for+essential+maintenance.++Apologies+for+the+inconvenience"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/open.201600132\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC5474657","pmid":"28638778","pubdate":"2017-03-22T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Synthesis and Detonation Properties of 5\u2010Amino\u20102,4,6\u2010trinitro\u20101,3\u2010dihydroxy\u2010benzene","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-detonation-properties-5amino246trinitro13dihydroxybenzene"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8396916,"mean":7.0724322720827,"rank":6372430,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1138853,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8396916,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248094,"mean":13.354547117411,"rank":178613,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":42481,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248094,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":402,"mean":3.2546932668329,"rank":253,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":55,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":402,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":1.9918181818182,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ChemistryOpen\/statuses\/844565716141555713","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18013963],"posted_on":"2017-03-22T15:05:32+00:00","author":{"name":"ChemistryOpen","url":"http:\/\/www.chemistryopen.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/671643396172304384\/fo4HnzKh_normal.jpg","description":"ChemistryOpen\u2014the first chemical society-owned open-access journal publishing primary research in all areas of chemistry from @chempubsoc_euro.","id_on_source":"ChemistryOpen","tweeter_id":"771120566","geo":{"lt":49.54887,"ln":8.66697,"country":"DE"},"followers":1130},"tweet_id":"844565716141555713"}]}}
