In biology, network analysis is now frequently adopted to organize protein-protein interactions, organize pathways and\/or to interpret gene co-expression patterns. However, comparative genomic analyses still largely rely on pairwise comparisons and linear visualizations between genomes. In this article, we discuss the challenges and prospects for establishing a generalized plant phylogenomic synteny network approach needed to interpret the wealth of new and emerging genomic data. We illustrate our approach with an example synteny network of B-class floral MADS-box genes. A broad synteny network approach holds great promise for understanding the evolutionary history of genes and genomes across broad phylogenetic groups and divergence times.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a8","authors":["Tao Zhao","M Eric Schranz"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pbi.2017.03.001","first_seen_on":"2017-03-22T16:19:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["13695266","1879-0356"],"journal":"Current Opinion in Plant Biology","last_mentioned_on":1490199978,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1369526616302230"],"pmid":"28327435","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["botany"],"title":"Network approaches for plant phylogenomic synteny analysis","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1369526616302230","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/network-approaches-plant-phylogenomic-synteny-analysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8396916,"mean":7.0724322720827,"rank":4483097,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2337254,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8396916,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248094,"mean":13.35452232832,"rank":140783,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":84232,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248094,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":645,"mean":3.8232391304348,"rank":399,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":645,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":13.037727272727,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
