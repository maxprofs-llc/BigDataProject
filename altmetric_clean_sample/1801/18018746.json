This study aimed to determine the burden and spectrum of BIs among SCD children hospitalized in a pediatric reference hospital in Cameroon, a SSA country.\nWe conducted a retrospective analysis of records of children hospitalized from November 2012 to August 2015 in the SCD unit of the Mother and Child Centre of the Chantal Biya Foundation, Cameroon. We enrolled all known SCD children aged 15\u00a0years or less, hospitalized for a suspicion of BI and who presented a positive culture of a body specimen.\nA total of 987 SCD children were hospitalized during the study period. Cultures were positive for 96 patients (9.7%) among whom 60.4% males. Ages ranged from 6 to 192\u00a0months with a median of 53 (Interquartile range (IQR) 21-101) months. For children no more covered by the Expanded Programme on Immunization, only 13 (18.8%) had received the Pneumo 23\u00ae and Meningo A&C\u00ae antigens, and 12 (17.4%), the Typhim vi\u00ae and the Haemophilus influenzae type b antigens; 58 children (84.1%) had received no vaccine. The specimen yielding positive cultures were: blood (70.7%), urine (13.1%), pus (9.1%), synovial fluid (4.1%), cerebrospinal fluid (2.0%), and bone fragment (1.0%). The different types of infection included: urinary tract infections (13.5%), myositis (8.3%), arthritis (6.3%), osteomyelitis (4.2%), and meningitis (2.1%); the site of infection was unidentified in 65.6% of cases. The main bacteria included: Salmonella sp. (28.1%), Staphylococcus sp. (18.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (17.7%), Escherichia coli (10.4%), Enterobacter sp. (5.2%), Acinetobacter sp. (4.2%), Streptococcus sp. (4.2%) and Serratia sp. (4.2%).\nThis retrospective analysis revealed 9.7% cases of BIs, mainly caused by Salmonella sp. (28.1%), Staphylococcus sp. (18.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (17.7%), and Escherichia coli (10.4%).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007bd","authors":["Anastasie Nicole Alima Yanda","Jobert Richie N.
