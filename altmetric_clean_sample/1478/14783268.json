A manual search of relevant journals and reference lists of enrolled studies was conducted. The studies investigating the diagnostic accuracy of CBCT or PR for ERR, with simulated ERR as the reference test, were considered eligible. The diagnostic accuracy of CBCT and PR was statistically pooled using a bivariate model. Meta-regression and subgroup analysis were performed to explore the sources of heterogeneity. Sensitivity analysis was used to test the stability of the overall results in the meta-analysis.\nA total of 15 studies were included in this systematic review. The pooled results showed that CBCT had significantly higher sensitivity (0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.77-0.96) and area under curve (0.96; 95% CI: 0.77-0.96) than PR (sensitivity: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.56-0.78; area under curve: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.85-0.90). No difference in sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve between conventional and digital PR was observed.\nCurrently available evidence suggests that CBCT could be reliable to detect the presence of ERR in clinical practice and has a higher diagnostic efficacy than PR.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f1b","authors":["Yi, Jianru","Sun, Yimin","Li, Yu","Li, Chunjie","Li, Xiaobing","Zhao, Zhihe"],"doi":"10.2319\/061916-481.1","first_seen_on":"2016-12-16T06:57:14+00:00","issns":["1945-7103","0003-3219"],"journal":"Angle Orthodontist","last_mentioned_on":1481868000,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27813424"],"pmid":"27813424","pubdate":"2016-11-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry","orthodontics"],"title":"\n              Cone-beam computed tomography versus periapical radiograph for diagnosing external root resorption:\n              A systematic review and meta-analysis\n            ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/conebeam-computed-tomography-versus-periapical-radiograph-diagnosing-external-root-resorption-system-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7896890,"mean":6.6848881279648,"rank":1497508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6368343,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7896890,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251977,"mean":12.391109819982,"rank":68003,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":183551,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251977,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":325,"mean":2.5658024691358,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":284,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":325,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":2.625,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":2},"by_discipline":{"Materials Science":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":6}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"JP":1}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"External root resorption diagnosis: cone-beam computed tomography or periapical radiographs?","url":"http:\/\/www.nationalelfservice.net\/dentistry\/oral-medicine-and-pathology\/external-root-resorption-diagnosis\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[14783268],"posted_on":"2016-12-16T06:00:00+00:00","summary":"15 in-vitro studies were included in this review of CBCT &amp; periapical radiographs for the diagnosis of external root resorption.
