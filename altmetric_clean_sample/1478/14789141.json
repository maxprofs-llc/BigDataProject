The site of eschar distribution was the face, 2.7%; neck, 5.4%; axilla, 18.9%; trunk, 10.8%; inguinal, 35.1%; and genitalia and buttocks, 27%. Lymphadenopathy was associated with 67.5% of eschars. The presence of eschar did not correlate with severity, complications, or response to therapy.\nCareful examination for eschar in children presenting with fever, particularly in the skin folds of the groin, genitalia, and axillae, can aid in early diagnosis of scrub typhus. Lymphadenopathy should alert the clinician to the possibility of finding an eschar in the drainage area.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032ac","authors":["Arun Babu, Thirunavukkarasu","Vijayadevagaran, Vijayasankar","Ananthakrishnan, Shanthi"],"doi":"10.1111\/pde.13048","first_seen_on":"2016-12-16T10:06:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1525-1470"],"journal":"Pediatric Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1481887898,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/pde.13048\/abstract;jsessionid=0E37817D8E5400C144C39FEC378DEF65.f04t01?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+on+Saturday+17th+December+2016+at+09%3A00+GMT%2F+04%3A00+EST%2F+17%3A00+SGT+for+4hrs+due+to+essential+maintenance.Apologies+for+the+inconvenience"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/pde.13048\/pdf","pmid":"27981627","pubdate":"2016-12-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology","pediatrics"],"title":"Characteristics of Pediatric Scrub Typhus Eschar in South Indian Children","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7896890,"mean":6.6848881279648,"rank":3912325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3783839,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7896890,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251977,"mean":12.391121725878,"rank":128866,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":113815,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251977,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":893,"mean":3.5509618834081,"rank":361,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":438,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":893,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":1.8578260869565,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/UCIP_HNJ\/statuses\/809701122093056001","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[14789141],"posted_on":"2016-12-16T10:06:05+00:00","author":{"name":"UCIP HNJ","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/449453730707288064\/v0AVcWoB_normal.jpeg","description":"Servicio de #CuidadosIntensivosPedi\u00e1tricos del Hospital Infantil Universitario Ni\u00f1o Jes\u00fas.
