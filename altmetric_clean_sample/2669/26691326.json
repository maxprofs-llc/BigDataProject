Pseudomonas sp. 61-3 possesses two types of PHA synthases, PHB synthase (PhbC) and PHA synthases (PhaC1 and PhaC2), encoded by the phb and pha loci, respectively. The P(94 mol% 3HB-co-6 mol% 3HA) copolymer synthesized by the recombinant strain of Pseudomonas sp. 61-3 (phbC::tet) harboring additional copies of phaC1 gene is known to have desirable physical properties and to be a flexible material with moderate toughness, similar to low-density polyethylene. In this study, we focused on the production of the P(3HB-co-3HA) copolymer using steamed soybean wastewater, a by-product in brewing miso, which is a traditional Japanese seasoning. The steamed soybean wastewater was spray-dried to produce a powder (SWP) and used as the sole nitrogen source for the synthesis of P(3HB-co-3HA) by the Pseudomonas sp. 61-3 recombinant strain. Hydrolyzed SWP (HSWP) was also used as a carbon and nitrogen source. P(3HB-co-3HA)s with relatively high 3HB fractions could be synthesized by a recombinant strain of Pseudomonas sp. 61-3 (phbC::tet) harboring additional copies of the phaC1 gene in the presence of 2% glucose and 10-20 g\/L SWP as the sole nitrogen source, producing a PHA concentration of 1.0-1.4 g\/L. When HSWP was added to a nitrogen- and carbon-free medium, the recombinant strain could synthesize PHA without glucose as a carbon source. The recombinant strain accumulated 32 wt% P(3HB-co-3HA) containing 80 mol% 3HB and 20 mol% medium-chain-length 3HA with a PHA concentration of 1.0 g\/L when 50 g\/L of HSWP was used. The PHA production yield was estimated as 20 mg-PHA\/g-HSWP, which equates to approximately 1.0 g-PHA per liter of soybean wastewater.","altmetric_jid":"56b367f52a83eea9718b45f2","authors":["Hokamura, Ayaka","Yunoue, Yuko","Goto, Saki","Matsusaki, Hiromi"],"doi":"10.3390\/bioengineering4030068","first_seen_on":"2017-09-28T10:33:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["2306-5354"],"issue":"3","journal":"Bioengineering","last_mentioned_on":1506603757,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28952548?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28952548","pubdate":"2017-08-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"MDPI AG","title":"Biosynthesis of Polyhydroxyalkanoate from Steamed Soybean Wastewater by a Recombinant Strain of Pseudomonas sp. 61-3","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biosynthesis-polyhydroxyalkanoate-steamed-soybean-wastewater-recombinant-strain-pseudomonas-sp-613"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":1.25,"1m":1.25,"1w":1.25,"6d":1.25,"5d":1.25,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462498,"mean":7.1083922572655,"rank":4275345,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3968373,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462498,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113818,"mean":11.508079900191,"rank":54581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":53929,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113818,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":1.52375,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.2833333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SoybeanPapers\/statuses\/913350783554379776","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26691326],"posted_on":"2017-09-28T10:32:50+00:00","author":{"name":"SoybeanPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/827928262294720513\/Z7taAmCb_normal.jpg","description":"Soybean Literature","id_on_source":"SoybeanPapers","tweeter_id":"827920594809257989","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":32},"tweet_id":"913350783554379776"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/pseudo_papers\/statuses\/913388475935686656","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26691326],"posted_on":"2017-09-28T13:02:37+00:00","author":{"name":"pseudomonaspapers","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/?term=pseudomonas","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/570219565901029376\/j3RfXxUz_normal.jpeg","description":"PubMed search bot for pseudomonas.
