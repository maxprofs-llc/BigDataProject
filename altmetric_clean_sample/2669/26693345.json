Its compactness is achieved by a CMOS ASIC combining a lock-in impedance demodulator with an oversampling 20-bit \u03a3\u0394 ADC and real-time peak detection embedded in field-programmable gate array. The module is coupled to a dielectrophoretic cell-sorting microfluidic device, offering compact and label-free electrical readout that replaces the need for a fluorescence microscope and, thus, is suitable for point-of-care diagnostics. The independent role of each dimension of the planar sensing microelectrodes is demonstrated, with simulations and experiments, along with its relevant effect on the spectrum of thin channels, deriving useful design guidelines.","authors":["Carminati, Marco","Ferrari, Giorgio","Vahey, Michael D","Voldman, Joel","Sampietro, Marco"],"doi":"10.1109\/tbcas.2017.2748158","first_seen_on":"2017-09-28T11:23:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1940-9990"],"journal":"IEEE transactions on biomedical circuits and systems","last_mentioned_on":1506597339,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28952947?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28952947","pubdate":"2017-09-22T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["biomedicalengineering","biotechnology"],"title":"backend-exception\n\n\tException from Backend: bePfetch (%23PmXmlSrv): Couldn't+resolve+%23PmXmlSrv,+the+address+table+is+empty.\n\n - PubMed - NCBI","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0.25,"6d":0.25,"5d":0.25,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/yeast_papers\/statuses\/913361558553608192","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26693345],"posted_on":"2017-09-28T11:15:39+00:00","author":{"name":"yeast_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yeast","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/470859351591092225\/S4XxHSFa_normal.jpeg","description":"Get your fresh daily #yeast #papers from #Pubmed, #Arxiv, #BioRxiv and #PeerJ here!
