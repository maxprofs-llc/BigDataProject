Both Medicare and private insurers offer coverage of LDCT screening to beneficiaries who are at high risk of developing lung cancer. In this study, we examined rates and predictors of chronic smoking behavior and eligibility for coverage of LDCT screening among older Chinese men living in the greater Chicago area.\nData were obtained from the Population Study of Chinese Elderly in Chicago, a population-based survey of community-dwelling, older Chinese adults in the Chicago metropolitan area. Eligibility criteria according to Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) for LDCT screening were used. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to determine predictors of chronic smoking behavior which was operationalized as meeting criteria for LDCT screening.\nA quarter of the sample were current smokers and 42.5% reported a prior history of smoking. Eighteen percent and 22% of older Chinese men met the eligibility criteria for appropriateness for CMS and USPSTF LDCT screening, respectively. Furthermore, education, marital status, and number of children were significantly associated with chronic smoking behavior.\nOlder Chinese men with chronic smoking behavior are at high risk of developing lung cancer and nearly one in five meet eligibility for LDCT screening. Increased outreach and education regarding early detection of lung cancer and smoking cessation are needed for this vulnerable and high-risk population.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fab","authors":["Li, Chien-Ching","Matthews, Alicia K.","Dong, XinQi"],"doi":"10.1093\/gerona\/glw202","first_seen_on":"2017-09-18T16:03:18+00:00","issns":["1079-5006","1758-535X"],"issue":"suppl_1","journal":"Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences & Medical Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1506181720,"links":["https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/biomedgerontology\/article-abstract\/72\/suppl_1\/S22\/3859668\/Examination-of-Chronic-Smoking-Behavior-and?redirectedFrom=fulltext"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/biomedgerontology\/article-pdf\/72\/suppl_1\/S22\/17644546\/glw202.pdf","pmid":"28575258","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Examination of Chronic Smoking Behavior and Eligibility for Low-Dose Computed Tomography for Lung Cancer Screening Among Older Chinese Male Smokers","type":"article","volume":"72","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/examination-chronic-smoking-behavior-eligibility-lowdose-computed-tomography-lung-cancer-screening-a"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.55,"score_history":{"1y":4.55,"6m":4.55,"3m":4.55,"1m":4.55,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454083,"mean":7.1051250224367,"rank":1775930,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6670249,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454083,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123943,"mean":11.825493634119,"rank":30941,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":92742,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123943,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1717,"mean":10.040970862471,"rank":581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":1134,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1717,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":24.8792,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
