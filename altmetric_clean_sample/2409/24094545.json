This article explains the value of real-time three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (RT 3D TEE) during cardiac surgery and cardiac interventions.\nRecently published recommendations and guidelines include the use of RT 3D TEE. RT 3 D TEE provides additional value particularly for guidance during cardiac interventions (i.e., transcatheter mitral valve repair, left atrial appendix and atrial septal defect closures), assessment of the mitral valve in surgical repair, measurement of left ventricular outflow tract area for transcatheter valvular replacements, and estimating right and left ventricular volumes and function. The exact localization of paravalvular leakage is another strength of RT 3D TEE. The major limitation is the reduced temporal resolution compared to 2D TEE.\nThree-dimensional echocardiography is a powerful tool that improves communication and accurate measurements of cardiac structures.","altmetric_jid":"52d3d42c86a348c7778b475f","authors":["Edwin Wilberforce Turton","J\u00f6rg Ender"],"doi":"10.1007\/s40140-017-0226-5","first_seen_on":"2017-08-20T06:37:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2167-6275","1523-3855"],"issue":"3","journal":"Current Anesthesiology Reports","last_mentioned_on":1503210980,"links":["https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s40140-017-0226-5"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs40140-017-0226-5.pdf","pmcid":"PMC5565647","pmid":"28890667","pubdate":"2017-07-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Anesthesiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"title":"Role of 3D Echocardiography in Cardiac Surgery: Strengths and Limitations","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-3d-echocardiography-cardiac-surgery-strengths-limitations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8403724,"mean":7.0757025513494,"rank":4487445,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2339330,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8403724,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":166949,"mean":12.697735163045,"rank":91571,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":58850,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":166949,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":2.2432954545455,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/edwinturton1970\/statuses\/899158136807972865","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24094545],"posted_on":"2017-08-20T06:36:20+00:00","author":{"name":"Edwin Turton","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/808536877036867588\/DoeGF6uz_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"edwinturton1970","tweeter_id":"1028582833","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":39},"tweet_id":"899158136807972865"}]}}
