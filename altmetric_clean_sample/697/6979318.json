HIV-infected patients had a higher incidence of fungemia. A total of 85.7% of the HIV-negative patients had underlying diseases including hematologic malignancies or had received therapy with corticosteroids or cytotoxic agents. By a Penicillium marneffei-specific mannoprotein Mp1p enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, serum antigen titers were found to be higher in HIV-positive patients, whereas serum antibody levels were found to be higher in HIV-negative patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be9","authors":["Wong, S S","Wong, K H","Hui, W T","Lee, S S","Lo, J Y","Cao, L","Yuen, K Y"],"doi":"10.1128\/jcm.39.12.4535-4540.2001","endpage":"4540","first_seen_on":"2016-04-27T04:51:13+00:00","issns":["0095-1137"],"issue":"12","journal":"Journal of Clinical Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1461732863,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11724878"],"pmcid":"PMC88582","pmid":"11724878","pubdate":"2001-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"4535","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Differences in Clinical and Laboratory Diagnostic Characteristics of Penicilliosis Marneffei in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)- and Non-HIV-Infected Patients","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/differences-clinical-laboratory-diagnostic-characteristics-penicilliosis-marneffei-human-immunodefic-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7615205,"mean":6.556701012339,"rank":3938021,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2135676,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7615205,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267040,"mean":11.388038690977,"rank":145002,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":95515,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267040,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4091,"mean":4.293915403423,"rank":2501,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1019,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4091,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92,"mean":2.8523736263736,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
