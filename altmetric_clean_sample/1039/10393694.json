All participants were assessed using the Arabic versions of the Tinetti assessment battery (TAB) for gait and balance, mini-mental state examination, and disability of arm, shoulder, and hand assessment test.\nA total of 221 nursing home residents were included in this study. Different chronic diseases were medically reported in this study. Psychiatric disorders (45.7%) were shown to be the most prevalent disease seen among the participants, followed by hypertension and diabetes mellitus affecting 33.5% and 23.5% of the participants, respectively. However, the least prevalent diseases were stroke (17.2%), joint inflammation (17.2%), and arthritis (9.0%). Based on TAB scores, the participants were classified into three groups: high risk of falls (\u226418; n=116), moderate risk of falls (19-23; n=25), and low risk of falls (\u226524; n=80). The correlation between physical activity and mental health problems with risks of falls was reported in all participants. The data showed that participants with over 50% upper extremity disability, stroke, heart disease, arthritis, joint diseases, diabetes, and hypertension recorded higher risks of falls as measured by TAB test compared to those with low and moderate TAB scores. Also, impairment in cognitive abilities and psychiatric disorders was shown to be associated with gait and balance problems, with a higher risk of falls in 47.5% and 46.1% of the residents, respectively.\nThis study revealed a significant impact of upper limb disability, stroke, heart disease, arthritis, joint diseases, diabetes, and hypertension as well as psychiatric disorders and cognitive disabilities on gait and balance deficits among home-resident older adults.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f02","authors":["Sami Gabr","Murad Al-Momani","Fidaa Al-Momani","Ahmad Alghadir","Sami Alharethy","Al-Momani, Murad","Al-Momani, Fidaa","Alghadir, Ahmad H","Alharethy, Sami","Gabr, Sami A"],"doi":"10.2147\/cia.s112282","endpage":"1049","first_seen_on":"2016-08-11T05:19:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1178-1998"],"journal":"Clinical Interventions in Aging","last_mentioned_on":1472561404,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/factors-related-to-gait-and-balance-deficits-in-older-adults-peer-reviewed-article-CIA","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27570449?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=31817","pmid":"27570449","pubdate":"2016-08-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1043","subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Factors related to gait and balance deficits in older adults","type":"article","volume":"Volume 11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/factors-related-gait-balance-deficits-older-adults"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8302052,"mean":6.9984430163018,"rank":6003178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2002678,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8302052,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258834,"mean":11.978923112586,"rank":167377,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":75906,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258834,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":990,"mean":5.3123579373104,"rank":671,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":990,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":3.7188679245283,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
