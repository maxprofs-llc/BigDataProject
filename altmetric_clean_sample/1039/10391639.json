This review focuses on CARs recognizing the B cell antigen CD19. Both retro- and lentiviral vectors are used encoding the different anti-CD19 CAR constructs comprising costimulatory molecules like CD28, CD137\/4-1BB and OX40 either alone (2nd generation CARs) or in combination (3rd generation CARs). Current up-to-date published studies on anti-CD19 CAR therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with observed side effects are discussed and an outlook on 59 ongoing trials is given. Clinical responses were achieved in up to 81 % of ALL, 50 % of CLL and 40 % of NHL patients. Factors with potential influence on the clinical outcome might be the design of the vector, the preconditioning regimen, the number and quality of transfused CAR TCs. The clinical angle might be relapse after allogeneic stem cell therapy (alloSCT), ineligibility for or \"bridging\" until alloSCT. In summary, CAR therapy represents a highly promising treatment option even in heavily pretreated patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002a0c","authors":["Miss Maria-Luisa Schubert","SchubertMaria-Luisa"],"doi":"10.1089\/hum.2016.097","endpage":"771","first_seen_on":"2016-08-11T01:55:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1557-7422","1043-0342"],"issue":"10","journal":"Human Gene Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1476877765,"links":["http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/10.1089\/hum.2016.097","http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1089\/hum.2016.097"],"pmid":"27479233","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Biotechnology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"758","subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy targeting CD19 positive leukemia and lymphoma in the context of stem cell transplantation","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chimeric-antigen-receptor-t-cell-therapy-targeting-cd19positive-leukemia-lymphoma-context-stem-cell-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7560115,"mean":6.5270342886323,"rank":3351021,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4134559,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7560115,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251183,"mean":11.746406111903,"rank":109255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":137429,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251183,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":453,"mean":9.7176637168142,"rank":220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":224,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":453,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":13.905555555556,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
