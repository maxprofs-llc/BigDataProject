This bacterial species can cause acute otitis media in pre-school children, sinusitis and exacerbations in patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as well as conjunctivitis and bacteremia. Since the introduction of a vaccine against H. influenzae serotype b in the 1990s, the burden of H. influenzae-related infections has been increasingly dominated by NTHi. Understanding the ability of NTHi to cause infection and disease is currently an expanding area of study. NTHi is able to mediate differential binding to the host tissue through the use of a broad range of adhesins. NTHi survival in the host is multifaceted, using virulence factors involved in complement resistance, biofilm, modified immunoglobulin responses, and, finally, formation and utilization of host proteins as a secondary strategy of increasing the adhesive ability.
