PMo12-GR films were modified on the surface of glassy carbon electrode (GCE) through electrostatic self-assembly with the aid of poly diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (PDDA). Then CuNPs were successfully decorated onto the PMo12-GR modified GCE through electrodeposition. The morphology of Cu\/PMo12-GR\/GCE was characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry were used to investigate the electrochemical performances of the biosensor. The results indicated that the modified electrode displayed a synergistic effect of PMo12-GR sheets and CuNPs towards the electro-oxidation of glucose in the alkaline solution. At the optimal detection potential of 0.50\u00a0V, the response towards glucose presented a linear response ranging from 0.10\u00a0\u03bcM to 1.0\u00a0mM with a detection limit of 3.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-2)\u00a0\u03bcM\u00a0(S\/N\u00a0=\u00a03). In addition, Cu\/PMo12-GR\/GCE possessed a high selectivity, good reproducibility, excellent stability and acceptable recovery, which indicating the potential application in clinical field.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002249","authors":["Xu, Jiaoyan","Cao, Xiyue","Xia, Jianfei","Gong, Shida","Wang, Zonghua","Lu, Lin"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.aca.2016.06.033","first_seen_on":"2016-08-11T10:44:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-4324","00032670"],"journal":"Analytica Chimica Acta","last_mentioned_on":1470927185,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27506342?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27506342","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Phosphomolybdic acid functionalized graphene loading copper nanoparticles modified electrodes for non-enzymatic electrochemical sensing of glucose","type":"article","volume":"934","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phosphomolybdic-acid-functionalized-graphene-loading-copper-nanoparticles-modified-electrodes-nonenz"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8200733,"mean":6.9347145888862,"rank":5935380,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1973803,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8200733,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257426,"mean":11.976602979508,"rank":167316,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":74768,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257426,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1765,"mean":2.1577267573696,"rank":1050,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":652,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1765,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":0.85851063829787,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
