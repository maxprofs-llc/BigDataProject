E6 and E7 repression resulted in down-regulation of DNA methyltransferase mRNA and protein expression, decreased DNA methylation and increased mRNA expression levels of tumor suppressor genes, induced a certain apoptosis and inhibited proliferation in E6 and E7 shRNA-infected SiHa and CaSki cells compared with the uninfected cells. Repression of E6 and E7 oncogenes resulted in restoration of DNA methyltransferase suppressor pathways and induced apoptosis in HPV16-positive cervical carcinoma cell lines. Our findings suggest that the potential carcinogenic mechanism of HPV16 through influencing DNA methylation pathway to activate the development of cervical cancer exist, and maybe as a candidate therapeutic strategy for cervical and other HPV-associated cancers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Li, Liming","Xu, Cui","Long, Jia","Shen, Danbei","Zhou, Wuqing","Zhou, Qiyan","Yang, Jia","Jiang, Mingjun"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.4525","first_seen_on":"2016-08-11T10:24:04+00:00","issns":["1949-2553"],"issue":"27","journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1470910864,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26329329?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4695162","pmid":"26329329","pubdate":"2016-10-20T09:23:25+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"E6 and E7 gene silencing results in decreased methylation of tumor suppressor genes and induces phenotype transformation of human cervical carcinoma cell lines.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/e6-e7-gene-silencing-results-decreased-methylation-tumor-suppressor-genes-induces-phenotype-transfor-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8200733,"mean":6.9347145888862,"rank":7096977,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8200733,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257426,"mean":11.976763026124,"rank":217279,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257426,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8756,"mean":3.1428267275842,"rank":5931,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8756,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230,"mean":5.0863668122271,"rank":211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
