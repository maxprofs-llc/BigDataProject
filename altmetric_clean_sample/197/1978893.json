Gls2 has been reported to be downregulated in human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). However, the underlying mechanism responsible for its downregulation is still unclear. Here, we investigated Gls2 expression and its promoter methylation status in human liver and colon cancers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008b0","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2407-13-601","first_seen_on":"2013-12-14T00:58:36+00:00","issns":["1471-2407"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1386983598,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2407\/13\/601\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2407-13-601.pdf","pmid":"24330717","pubdate":"2013-12-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"601","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Epigenetic silencing of glutaminase 2 in human liver and colon cancers","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epigenetic-silencing-glutaminase-2-human-liver-colon-cancers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6228985,"mean":5.9651782765876,"rank":2736872,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3326801,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6228985,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143737,"mean":7.4681653726277,"rank":63994,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":74726,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143737,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3060,"mean":2.9348198757764,"rank":1106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":1764,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3060,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":1.7025957446809,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":58,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
