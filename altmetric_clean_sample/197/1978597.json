An alternative treatment option, comprised of splinting and soft tissue mobilization techniques, was introduced to stabilize early contractures of the proximal interphalangeal joint in the hopes of delaying or obviating surgery. Over the course of approximately 12.6 months (\u00b1 7.8), thirteen patients were followed at the hand clinic at Hotel Dieu Hospital in Kingston. One patient was unable to complete the course of therapy. Of the remaining patients, analysis showed significant improvement in active proximal interphalangeal joint extension of approximately 14.6\u00b0 (SD: \u00b1 5.1\u00b0; range: 5-25\u00b0) over the course of the treatment (p < .05). Nighttime static extension splinting and soft tissue mobilization techniques appear to delay and possibly prevent the need for surgery in individuals with flexion contractures of the proximal interphalangeal joint due to Dupuytren's disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008e4f","authors":["J Larocerie-Salgado","J Davidson"],"doi":"10.1177\/1753193411422680","first_seen_on":"2013-12-13T21:29:04+00:00","issns":["2043-6289"],"issue":"8","journal":"Journal of Hand Surgery (European Volume)","last_mentioned_on":1386970044,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21965179"],"pmid":"21965179","pubdate":"2012-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Nonoperative treatment of PIPJ flexion contractures associated with Dupuytren's disease.","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nonoperative-treatment-pipj-flexion-contractures-associated-dupuytrens-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631167,"mean":4.9271322908448,"rank":2898692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":80453,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631167,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113234,"mean":6.9947459309568,"rank":88436,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":554,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113234,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":506,"mean":0.65724356435644,"rank":241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":506,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":0.39166666666667,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":7,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":7,"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":3}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Nonoperative treatment of PIPJ flexion c...
