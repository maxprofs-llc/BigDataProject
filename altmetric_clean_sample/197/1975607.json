Eosinophil lysis may be significantly pathogenic. Bronchial mucosal FEGs are associated with uncontrolled asthma, severe asthma, aspirin-sensitive asthma, and lethal asthma. FEGs in the bronchial wall may characterize severe asthma without sputum eosinophilia. Excessive numbers of sputum FEGs occur in severe exacerbations of asthma and are reduced along with clinical improvement. Occurrence of FEGs affects interpretation of other sputum biomarkers including numbers of eosinophils, ECP, and eosinophil-stained macrophages. Thus, eosinophil lysis produces FEGs as bronchial biomarkers of severe asthma. Blood eosinophils in severe asthma seem primed exhibiting a propensity to lyse that is greater the more severe the asthma. Proclivity of blood eosinophils to lyse also distinguished three levels of severity among children with exacerbations of asthma. Numerous FEGs releasing toxic proteins occur in association with grave derangement and shedding of epithelium in severe asthma. Subepithelial FEGs correlate negatively with intact bronchial epithelium in clinically uncontrolled asthma. Significant correlations between sputum ECP, Creola bodies, and severity of asthma exacerbations have also been demonstrated. Hence, eosinophil lysis apparently causes epithelial desquamation in severe asthma. Exaggerated epithelial repair in turn would contribute to inflammatory and remodelling features of severe asthma. Perseverance of FEGs together with maintained disease activity, despite treatment with 'eosinophil-depleting' steroids and anti-IL5 biologicals, agrees with the possibility that eosinophil lysis is worthy target for novel anti-asthma drugs. Priming and lysis of eosinophils, and protein release from FEGs, are regulated and can be targeted. Eosinophil lysis and FEGs belong to the disease picture of severe asthma and need consideration in asthma studies concerned with phenotypes, biomarkers, roles of epithelial injury\/repair, and targeting novel drugs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002545","authors":["Persson C","Persson, C."],"doi":"10.1111\/cea.12255","endpage":"183","first_seen_on":"2013-12-12T18:13:31+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1365-2222","0954-7894","09547894"],"issue":"2","journal":"Clinical & Experimental Allergy","last_mentioned_on":1411470850,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cea.12255\/abstract;jsessionid=0D910AC481EB4A509B07A98CD4612473.f03t04","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cea.12255\/abstract;jsessionid=E13900BC2B35F75DFF1AF5E62487E435.f02t03","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cea.12255\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cea.12255\/abstract?utm_content=buffer7732d&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24330324?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cea.12255\/pdf","pmid":"24330324","pubdate":"2013-12-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"173","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Primary lysis of eosinophils in severe desquamative asthma.","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/primary-lysis-eosinophils-severe-desquamative-asthma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6692642,"mean":6.1590254522819,"rank":2422082,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4226524,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6692642,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171094,"mean":6.6957966135379,"rank":51470,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":118262,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171094,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1275,"mean":5.4481302982732,"rank":738,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":506,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1275,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.4125,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
