A 65-year-old man with constipation and appetite loss was admitted to our hospital. An ultrasound examination revealed evidence of bilateral hydronephrosis. He was diagnosed as acute post renal failure, and nephrostomy was done. CT and MRI showed a solid mass in the area of seminal vesicle. He underwent transrectal core biopsy, which histologically showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemistry showed the tumor to be CA125 positive, CEA positive and CK7 positive but PSA negative. FDG-PET\/CT revealed an increased uptake of FDG only in the area of seminal vesicle. Serum CA125 was elevated and PSA stayed within normal limit. Primaly rectal carcinoma was ruled out by colonoscopy. The result of transperineal prostate biopsy was negative. We diagnosed him as suffering from primary seminal vesicle carcinoma. Anti-androgen blockade and radiotherapy to whole pelvis were performed, and serum CA125 level was improved. But, 6 months later serum CA125 re-elevated and 19 months later multiple liver metastases were noted. The patient received two cycles of docetaxel and cisplatin chemotherapy, however he developed pulmonaly embolism and rectal bleeding by tumor invasion and he died of his disease 22 months after the diagnosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9203cf058f61000d7a5","authors":["Nobuhiko Mizuno","Naoya Fujikawa","Narihiko Hayashi","Takayuki Murakami","Kotaro Suzuki","Ichiro Ikeda"],"first_seen_on":"2013-12-13T19:03:31+00:00","issns":["0021-5287"],"issue":"6","journal":"Nippon Hiny\u014dkika Gakkai zasshi.
