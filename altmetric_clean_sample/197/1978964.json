Most cases are controlled with first-line measures, but intractable epistaxis can be a challenging clinical problem requiring posterior nasal packing and surgical or endovascular intervention. Bleeding from nasal telangiectasias is well known in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, but there are no reports in the literature of recurrent epistaxis due to isolated telangiectasias not associated with systemic disease. This report describes a series of cases in which intractable epistaxis due to isolated primary telangiectasias was effectively controlled with bipolar electrosurgery.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"53bd372b2a83eef6128b456b","authors":["Timothy Stoddard","Todd A.
