Methods: Microbiological assessment of primary packaging material was carried out and long-term survival of bacterial spores in alcohol was assessed using sporulated B. subtilis ATCC 6633 as a standard. In-use contamination of alcohol-based formulations was tested by repeated use over 12 months under practical conditions and microbiological and physico-chemical data were determined. Results: Among 625 containers analyzed, 542 did not yield any microbial growth. Median colony count for aerobic spore-forming bacteria was 0.2 cfu\/10 ml container content. No anaerobic spore-forming bacteria were detected. Additionally, long-term survival of bacterial spores in aliphatic C2-C3 alcohols revealed 1-propanol to reduce the number of spores most effectively, with 2-propanol and ethanol having a somewhat less pronounced impact. In-use tests did not detect any microbial contamination or change in the physicochemical properties of the tested products over 12 months. Conclusions: Our data reveals that state-of-the-art production processes of alcohol-based hand rubs and antiseptics can be regarded safe. Primary packaging material and use were not found to pose a significant contamination risk as far as bacterial spores are concerned. Based on the data from this study, a microbial limit of <1 cfu\/10 ml can be suggested as a quality-control threshold for finished goods to ensure high quality and safe products.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef6f2a83ee09648b517c","authors":["Katrin Steinhauer","Bernhard Meyer","Christiane Ostermeyer","Hans-Joachim R\u00f6dger","Matthias Hintzpeter"],"doi":"10.3205\/dgkh000219","first_seen_on":"2013-12-12T13:21:39+00:00","issns":["2196-5226"],"issue":"2","journal":"GMS Hygiene and Infection Control","last_mentioned_on":1388645416,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24327945?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3850229\/?report=classic"],"pmid":"24327945","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Hygienic safety of alcohol-based hand disinfectants and skin antiseptics.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hygienic-safety-alcoholbased-hand-disinfectants-skin-antiseptics"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4759378,"mean":5.7095406108846,"rank":2361371,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2254621,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4759378,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127927,"mean":7.4880881134407,"rank":56849,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":66355,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127927,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RoanokeTavern\/status\/411123549588299777","license":"public","citation_ids":[1974979],"posted_on":"2013-12-12T13:21:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Stephen","url":"http:\/\/q.gs\/23c1R","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2358584914\/7mqo0ezv5agzqk2frzmq_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"RoanokeTavern","tweeter_id":"176353026","geo":{"lt":47.57065,"ln":-122.22207,"country":"US"},"followers":2357},"tweet_id":"411123549588299777"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Hlth_Literacy\/status\/418635336961757184","license":"public","citation_ids":[1974979],"posted_on":"2014-01-02T06:50:16+00:00","author":{"name":"Health Literacy","url":"http:\/\/hiv-insight.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/731064960\/LiteracyII_normal.jpg","description":"Eclectic health info, Health Literacy  Also @HIV_Insight @Prison_Health, @Why_We_Do_That, @Sex_Worker_Hlth","id_on_source":"Hlth_Literacy","tweeter_id":"77314206","geo":{"lt":21.30694,"ln":-157.85833,"country":"US"},"followers":6035},"tweet_id":"418635336961757184"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Hlth_Literacy\/status\/413023462916378624","license":"public","citation_ids":[1974979],"posted_on":"2013-12-17T19:10:41+00:00","author":{"name":"Health Literacy","url":"http:\/\/hiv-insight.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/731064960\/LiteracyII_normal.jpg","description":"Eclectic health info, Health Literacy  Also @HIV_Insight @Prison_Health, @Why_We_Do_That, @Sex_Worker_Hlth","id_on_source":"Hlth_Literacy","tweeter_id":"77314206","geo":{"lt":21.30694,"ln":-157.85833,"country":"US"},"followers":6035},"tweet_id":"413023462916378624"}]}}
