Data obtained from animal studies suggest that the intestinal serotonergic system and herein particularly the serotonin receptor 3 (5-HT3R) may be involved in sugar detection and short-term control of food intake. Using a mouse model, we tested the hypothesis that blocking 5-HT3R prevents the development of sugar-induced obesity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b83","authors":["S Weber","V Volynets","G Kanuri","I Bergheim","S C Bischoff","Weber S","Volynets V","Kanuri G","Bergheim I","Bischoff SC"],"doi":"10.1038\/ijo.2009.191","endpage":"1347","first_seen_on":"2013-12-13T17:19:55+00:00","issns":["1476-5497","0307-0565"],"issue":"12","journal":"International Journal of Obesity","last_mentioned_on":1386952607,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/19823183\/?i=11&from=beta-hydroxybutyrate%20serotonin","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19823183"],"pmid":"19823183","pubdate":"2009-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"1339","subjects":["metabolism"],"title":"Treatment with the 5-HT3 antagonist tropisetron modulates glucose-induced obesity in mice.","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/treatment-5ht3-antagonist-tropisetron-modulates-glucoseinduced-obesity-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6420027,"mean":5.8819205099804,"rank":4743794,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":950610,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6420027,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143439,"mean":7.4691766616937,"rank":95824,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":26758,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143439,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1889,"mean":15.190150423729,"rank":1667,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":89,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1889,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":14.371636363636,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
