In particular, Bedouin in Lebanon have increasingly embraced the Lebanese national bio-medical health system in the past two decades, while Lebanese policy-makers' responses continue to be minimal and ill-informed. This paper investigates the mismatch between policy-makers' formulations of Bedouin consanguineous marriages and the Bedouins's actual reproductive practices and discusses the implications of these formulations on the Bedouins's access to health services. Design The findings are drawn from the data collected as part of the Bedouin Health Project, an EU-funded five-year study (2005-2010), aiming at assessing access to reproductive and child health care among the Bedouin in Lebanon. The data was collected from 6 clusters representing the main Bedouin informal and unrecognized settlements in the Bekaa Valley of Lebanon. The data consists of 111 socioeconomic questionnaires with Bedouin women users of local public, private, and nongovernmental reproductive and child health-focused clinics, in addition to 40 in-depth interviews with Bedouin women across the clusters and 17 semi-structured interviews with policy-makers. Results The findings suggest a gap between the perceptions of policy-makers and the incidence of consanguineous marriages and reproductive practices among the Bedouin. While there was no national data available for the Bedouin populations, policy-makers relied on a constructed 'Bedouin reproductive profile' that portrayed them as 'a problematic health group'. The national policy formulation of the Bedouin reproductive profile has an exclusionary impact on the Bedouin population as they are ignored from any targeted health policies or provided with politically motivated palliative care provision. Conclusion These findings highlight the importance of addressing stereotyping and discrimination among health practitioners and policy-makers, as a crucial part of improving the overall marriage and reproductive health practices of the Bedouin.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d73cf058f610001286","authors":["Nisrine Mansour","Dawn Chatty","Faysal El-Kak","Nasser Yassin","Mansour N","Chatty D","El-Kak F","Yassin N"],"doi":"10.1080\/13557858.2013.848844","endpage":"19","first_seen_on":"2013-12-12T09:02:03+00:00","issns":["1355-7858","1465-3419"],"journal":"Ethnicity &amp; Health","last_mentioned_on":1427796394,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/pdf\/10.1080\/13557858.2013.848844","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24219619?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24219619","pubdate":"2013-11-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Sociology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["publichealth","socialsciences"],"title":"They aren't all first cousins: Bedouin marriage and health policies in Lebanon.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/arent-first-cousins-bedouin-marriage-health-policies-lebanon"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4941811,"mean":5.8614681928312,"rank":2017738,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2898979,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4941811,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":131435,"mean":7.454409589604,"rank":44551,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":86067,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":131435,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138,"mean":2.4571240875912,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":92,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":3.1875,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
