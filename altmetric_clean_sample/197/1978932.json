Whether pericyte degeneration can influence AD-like neurodegeneration and contribute to disease pathogenesis remains, however, unknown. Here we show that in mice overexpressing A\u03b2-precursor protein, pericyte loss elevates brain A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 levels and accelerates amyloid angiopathy and cerebral \u03b2-amyloidosis by diminishing clearance of soluble A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 from brain interstitial fluid prior to A\u03b2 deposition. We further show that pericyte deficiency leads to the development of tau pathology and an early neuronal loss that is normally absent in A\u03b2-precursor protein transgenic mice, resulting in cognitive decline. Our data suggest that pericytes control multiple steps of AD-like neurodegeneration pathogenic cascade in A\u03b2-precursor protein-overexpressing mice. Therefore, pericytes may represent a novel therapeutic target to modify disease progression in AD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Abhay P.
