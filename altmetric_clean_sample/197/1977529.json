This allows an object to be concealed (cloaked) under an uneven portion of the surface, without disturbing the wave propagation on the surface. The cloaks proposed in this Letter achieve perfect cloaking that only relies upon isotropic radially dependent refractive index profiles, contrary to those previously published. In addition, these cloaks are very thin, just a fraction of a wavelength in thickness, yet can conceal electrically large objects. While this paper focuses on cloaking electromagnetic surface waves, the theory is also valid for other types of surface waves. The performance of these cloaks is simulated using dielectric filled waveguide geometries, and the curvature of the surface is shown to be rendered invisible, hiding any object positioned underneath. Finally, a transformation of the required dielectric slab permittivity was performed for surface wave propagation, demonstrating the practical applicability of this technique.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008519","authors":["R.
