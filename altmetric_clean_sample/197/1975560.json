The pain minimally improved with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications. Clinical examination revealed a relatively normal foot with palpable changes in the bony structures at the midfoot consistent with a tarsal subluxation. Cuboid reduction was performed using high-velocity, low-amplitude manipulation, after which the patient reported immediate and near-complete pain relief. The authors also review mechanisms of injury, clinical findings, and treatment modalities for patients with tarsal subluxation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005abd","authors":["Joshua Batt","Michael M Neeki"],"doi":"10.7556\/jaoa.2013.062","first_seen_on":"2013-12-12T17:43:49+00:00","issns":["1945-1997"],"issue":"11","journal":"Journal of the American Osteopathic Association","last_mentioned_on":1386870104,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/24174508\/"],"pmid":"24174508","pubdate":"2013-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["osteopathicmedicine"],"title":"Osteopathic manipulative treatment in tarsal somatic dysfunction: a case study.","type":"article","volume":"113","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/osteopathic-manipulative-treatment-tarsal-somatic-dysfunction-case-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3622349,"mean":4.9310300946799,"rank":2904698,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":72500,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3622349,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112800,"mean":7.0198299807624,"rank":88468,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":299,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112800,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":349,"mean":2.6340287356322,"rank":217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":349,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":3.8,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":4,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":4,"Lecturer":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":11,"Psychology":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":3,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"LK":1,"GB":1,"PT":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Osteopathic manipulative treatment in t...
