Based on qPCR analysis of FACS-purified gastric ghrelin cells, highly expressed and enriched 7TM receptors were comprehensively identified and functionally characterized using in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo methods. Five G\u03b1s-coupled receptors efficiently stimulated ghrelin secretion: as expected the \u03b21-adrenergic, the GIP and the secretin receptors but surprisingly also the composite receptor for the sensory neuropeptide CGRP and the melanocortin 4 receptor. A number of G\u03b1i\/o-coupled receptors inhibited ghrelin secretion including somatostatin receptors SSTR1, SSTR2 and SSTR3 and unexpectedly the highly enriched lactate receptor, GPR81. Three other metabolite receptors known to be both G\u03b1i\/o- and G\u03b1q\/11-coupled all inhibited ghrelin secretion through a pertussis toxin-sensitive G\u03b1i\/o pathway: FFAR2 (short chain fatty acid receptor; GPR43), FFAR4 (long chain fatty acid receptor; GPR120) and CasR (calcium sensing receptor). In addition to the common G\u03b1 subunits three non-common G\u03b1i\/o subunits were highly enriched in ghrelin cells: G\u03b1oA, G\u03b1oB and G\u03b1z. Inhibition of G\u03b1i\/o signaling via ghrelin cell-selective pertussis toxin expression markedly enhanced circulating ghrelin. These 7TM receptors and associated G\u03b1 subunits constitute a major part of the molecular machinery directly mediating neuronal and endocrine stimulation versus metabolite and somatostatin inhibition of ghrelin secretion including a series of novel receptor targets not previously identified on the ghrelin cell.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"537f30862a83eeb45a8b4630","authors":["Maja S Engelstoft","Won-Mee Park","Ichiro Sakata","Line V Kristensen","Anna Sofie Husted","Sherri Osborne-Lawrence","Paul K Piper","Angela K Walker","Maria H Pedersen","Mark K N\u00f8hr","Jie Pan","Christopher J Sinz","Paul E Carrington","Taro E Akiyama","Robert M Jones","Cong Tang","Kashan Ahmed","Stefan Offermanns","Kristoffer L Egerod","Jeffrey M Zigman","Thue W Schwartz"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.molmet.2013.08.006","first_seen_on":"2013-12-12T14:13:10+00:00","issns":["2212-8778"],"issue":"4","journal":"Molecular Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1387032748,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24327954?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24327954"],"pmid":"24327954","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor repertoire of gastric ghrelin cells.","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/seven-transmembrane-g-proteincoupled-receptor-repertoire-gastric-ghrelin-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506837,"mean":5.127001515923,"rank":2320158,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1556023,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506837,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123239,"mean":7.2746669533749,"rank":59623,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":44639,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123239,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159,"mean":3.6816582278481,"rank":81,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":5.4213333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":10,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
