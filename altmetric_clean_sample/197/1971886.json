To investigate mechanisms that underlie different modes of cross talk, we have focused on argos, an EGFR pathway regulator in Drosophila melanogaster which is upregulated by Notch in adult muscle progenitors but is repressed in the wing. Results show that the alternate modes of cross talk depend on the engagement of enhancers with opposite regulatory logic, which are selected by context-determining factors. This is likely to be a general mechanism for enabling the wiring between these pathways to switch according to context.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f61000310d","authors":["Benjamin E Housden","Ana Terriente-Felix","Sarah J Bray","Housden BE","Terriente-Felix A","Bray SJ","B.
