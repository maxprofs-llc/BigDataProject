During daylight hours they remain in an akinetic state inside their shelters, whereas at dusk they become active and move outside. When they are outside their shelters during the photophase, triatomines are vulnerable to diurnal predators and the period just before dawn is critical to their survival. This work analyses the existence of competitive interactions involved in the occupancy of shelters by triatomines. Behavioural assays were performed in which nymphs of different stages, nutritional status or species were released in an experimental arena containing a space-limited artificial shelter. The proportions of individuals occupying the shelter during the photophase were quantified to estimate the competitive abilities of each stage and species. Intraspecific comparisons showed higher levels of shelter occupancy for fourth over fifth instars and fed over unfed nymphs of Triatoma infestans. Interspecific comparisons showed higher rates of shelter occupancy for Triatoma sordida in comparison with T. infestans, and for T. infestans over Rhodnius prolixus. Arrival order was also relevant to determining shelter occupancy levels: early arrival was advantageous in comparison with later arrival. The study of intra- and interspecific competitive interactions for shelter occupancy provides relevant information about colonization and recolonization processes in the natural environments of triatomines.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5023cf058f610003091","authors":["ZACHARIAS, C.
