However, the mechanical properties of conventional hydrogels often degrade rapidly after swelling or with increasing water content, limiting their potential in many applications. Here we describe a new class of PEG-containing hydrogels that remain highly resilient after maximum swelling. We achieved the hydrogels by incorporating reversible \"dual\" hydrogen bonding into highly coiled, elastic PEG networks. These hydrogels, due to their high water content and high mechanical resilience, can form highly permeable, yet durable and easy-to-handle cell delivery devices without any additional structural support. In addition, optimization of chemical composition resulted in hydrogels with superior bio-inertness, inducing much less fibrosis upon subcutaneous implantation in mice than a polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate (PHEMA) hydrogel control.\nHydrogels such as polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based ones are broadly used in the biomedical world. Examples include wound dressings, tissue scaffolds, medical implants, biosensors and drug or cell delivery devices. In many of these applications, robust mechanical property, high water content(or facile mass transfer)andfavorable interactions with the bodyare often simultaneously desirable. However, the mechanical property of hydrogels often degrades rapidly after swelling or with increasing water content. Here we report a new class of PEG-based hydrogels that simultaneously possess high water content, high mechanical resilience and low fibrotic response upon subcutaneousimplantationin mice. These hydrogels may therefore find broadapplicationsin biomedicine.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f61000682a","authors":["Yu Zhang","Duo An","Yehudah Pardo","Alan Chiu","Wei Song","Qingsheng Liu","Fang Zhou","Sean P.
