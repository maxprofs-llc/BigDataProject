Data were analysed by non-parametric tests and basic content analysis.\nAll nursing homes in the highest transfer rate group and one in the lowest transfer rate group were run by private for-profit providers. Compared with the low group, the high group had fewer updated advance care plans and the RNs interviewed had less work experience in care of older people and less training in care of persons with dementia. There was no difference in nursing home size or staff\/resident ratio. The RNs described similar possibilities to provide palliative care, medical equipment and perceived medical support from GPs.","altmetric_jid":"53222dc92a83ee27268b4590","authors":["Kirsebom, Marie","Hedstr\u00f6m, Mariann","P\u00f6der, Ulrika","Wadensten, Barbro"],"doi":"10.1002\/nop2.68","endpage":"48","first_seen_on":"2017-03-02T16:40:25+00:00","issns":["20541058","2054-1058"],"issue":"1","journal":"Nursing Open","last_mentioned_on":1488983465,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/nop2.68\/full?hootPostID=4ec1238c853eb6619056bfd2650bb17d","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/nop2.68\/full?hootPostID=ea2fbb4b1368cc3976fd1358d7431ddc","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/nop2.68\/full?hootPostID=457fc1ee4f21443eb2086fad37425021","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/nop2.68\/full?hootPostID=b12507f5d6ff49dbc3b9a3eeca2200ea"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/nop2.68\/pdf","pmid":"28078098","pubdate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"41","title":"Transfer of nursing home residents to emergency departments: organizational differences between nursing homes with high vs. low transfer rates","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/nop2.68","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transfer-nursing-home-residents-emergency-departments-organizational-differences-between-nursing-hom"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.2,"score_history":{"1y":3.2,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8324953,"mean":7.0165383958894,"rank":2087949,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":6219908,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8324953,"percentile":74},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242711,"mean":13.714887857937,"rank":84195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":157685,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242711,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":6.7575471698113,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":7.77,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Other":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Social Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Wiley_Nursing\/statuses\/837341775371071493","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16936988],"posted_on":"2017-03-02T16:40:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Wiley Nursing","url":"http:\/\/www.wileyonlinelibrary.com\/subject\/nursing","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000090387545\/20b01e98fbe3a4c6f072ca5f0603b74c_normal.png","description":"Global resource for multidisciplinary publications for nursing students, educators, practitioners and researchers in all areas.","id_on_source":"Wiley_Nursing","tweeter_id":"104526382","geo":{"lt":42.35843,"ln":-71.05977,"country":"US"},"followers":7373},"tweet_id":"837341775371071493"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/FSHCNurses\/statuses\/837344132129488896","license":"gnip","rt":["Wiley_Nursing"],"citation_ids":[16936988],"posted_on":"2017-03-02T16:49:32+00:00","author":{"name":"FSHC Nurses","url":"http:\/\/www.fshc.co.uk","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/868540453666394112\/xe-JqGzI_normal.jpg","description":"Sharing News, Research & Best Practice from #CareHome #Nurses across @FourSeasonsHCUK.
