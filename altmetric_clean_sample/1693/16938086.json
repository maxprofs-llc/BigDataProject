A validated headache-related quality-of-life survey, the Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT), was administered preoperatively and postoperatively to patients who had tension-type headache. The minimum time interval after the operation was 3 months (mean, 13.5 weeks; range, 12-17 weeks).\nPostoperative HIT scores, decline in HIT scores, and marginal reflex distance test 1 scores.\nOf the 108 patients (66 women and 42 men; mean [SD] age, 49.8 [10.7] years) who underwent blepharoplasty and the 44 patients (26 women and 18 men; mean [SD] age, 45.6 [17.8] years) who underwent ptosis repair, 38 (35.2%) and 28 (63.6%), respectively, had symptoms of tension-type headaches. In both groups, the mean (SD) postoperative HIT scores were statistically significantly better than the preoperative HIT scores (blepharoplasty group: preoperative score, 55.9 [6.6] vs postoperative score, 46.4 [9.0]; ptosis repair group: preoperative score, 60.0 [7.2] vs postoperative score, 42.3 [9.3]; P\u2009=\u2009.001). In the patients who underwent ptosis repair, the mean (SD) preoperative HIT score was significantly higher than in those who underwent blepharoplasty (60.0 [7.2] vs 55.9 [6.6]; P\u2009=\u2009.007) and the postoperative HIT score was significantly lower than those who underwent blepharoplasty (42.3 [9.3] vs 46.4 [9.0]; P\u2009=\u2009.03). The mean (SD) decline in the HIT score was significantly higher in patients who underwent ptosis repair than in those who underwent blepharoplasty (17.8 [9.9] vs 9.5 [8.6]; P\u2009=\u2009.002). For patients who underwent ptosis repair, there was a statistically significant negative correlation between the results on the marginal reflex distance test 1 (median, 1.82; minimum, 1.0; maximum, 3.5) and change in the HIT score (median, 18; minimum, 0; maximum, 30) (P\u2009=\u2009.005; r\u2009=\u2009-0.645). In patients who underwent ptosis repair, the mean (SD) difference between the preoperative and postoperative HIT scores was significantly higher for the patients who underwent levator resection (3.1 [0.3]) than for those who underwent M\u00fcller muscle resection (1.5 [0.7]) and frontalis suspension procedures (1.9 [0.7]) (P\u2009=\u2009.001).\nThe operations for ptosis and blepharoptosis provide significant relief for tension-type headache and result in improved headache-related quality of life. As a result, tension-type headache can be a functional indication for upper eyelid blepharoplasty and ptosis repair, especially for patients with lower results on the marginal reflex distance test 1.\n3.","altmetric_jid":"53bd372b2a83eef6128b4567","authors":["Ilke Bahceci Simsek"],"doi":"10.1001\/jamafacial.2016.2120","first_seen_on":"2017-03-02T17:39:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2168-6092","2168-6076"],"journal":"JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1506570189,"links":["http:\/\/jamanetwork.com\/journals\/jamafacialplasticsurgery\/article-abstract\/2605435","http:\/\/jamanetwork.com\/journals\/jamafacialplasticsurgery\/fullarticle\/2605435?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social_jamafps&utm_campaign=article_alert&utm_content=automated","http:\/\/jamanetwork.com\/journals\/jamafacialplasticsurgery\/fullarticle\/2605435?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/jamanetwork.com\/journals\/jamafacialplasticsurgery\/article-abstract\/2605435?utm_content=bufferf7e9b&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1001\/jamafacial.2016.2120","http:\/\/jamanetwork.com\/journals\/jamafacialplasticsurgery\/article-abstract\/2605435?utm_campaign=New%20blog%20campaign%20with%20g2m&utm_content=50299117&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter","http:\/\/jamanetwork.com\/journals\/jamafacialplasticsurgery\/article-abstract\/2605435?utm_source=gplus&utm_medium=social_jamafps&utm_campaign=article_alert&utm_content=automated","http:\/\/jamanetwork.com\/journals\/jamafacialplasticsurgery\/fullarticle\/2605435?utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=content-shareicons&utm_content=article_engagement&utm_medium=social&utm_term=030517#.WLxklcrYrQY.facebook","http:\/\/jamanetwork.com\/journals\/jamafacialplasticsurgery\/article-abstract\/2605435?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social_jamafps&utm_campaign=article_alert&utm_content=automated","http:\/\/jamanetwork.com\/journals\/jamafacialplasticsurgery\/article-abstract\/2605435?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=%5btwitter%5d&utm_campaign=%5barticle_alert%5d&utm_content=%5bautomated%5d","http:\/\/jamanetwork.com\/journals\/jamafacialplasticsurgery\/fullarticle\/2605435?utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=content-shareicons&utm_content=article_engagement&utm_medium=social&utm_term=072117#.WXH4SL2IL0Q.facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/archfaci.jamanetwork.com\/data\/journals\/faci\/0\/jamafacial_bahceci_simsek_2017_oi_160063.pdf","pmid":"28253391","pubdate":"2017-03-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Medical Association","subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Association of Upper Eyelid Ptosis Repair and Blepharoplasty With Headache-Related Quality of Life","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/archfaci.jamanetwork.com\/article.aspx?doi=10.1001\/jamafacial.2016.2120","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-upper-eyelid-ptosis-repair-blepharoplasty-headacherelated-quality-life"},"altmetric_score":{"score":20.95,"score_history":{"1y":20.95,"6m":4.7,"3m":3.7,"1m":0.85,"1w":0.85,"6d":0.85,"5d":0.85,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":20.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462170,"mean":7.1084920520889,"rank":431262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":8030747,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462170,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245463,"mean":13.748585744433,"rank":23858,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":221570,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245463,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":518,"mean":15.50320696325,"rank":76,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":442,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":518,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":38.116275862069,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":9,"practitioner":3,"science_communicator":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":3,"Members of the public":9,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":6,"FR":1,"KW":2,"GB":1,"AU":1}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Headache-Related QoL Improves After Ptosis Repair","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=29857183867&p=1pl&v=1&x=p1BiV6dtwAwnkCp05tUPsg","license":"public","citation_ids":[16938086],"posted_on":"2017-03-10T23:05:57+00:00","summary":"Reuters Health Information By Reuters Staff | March 10, 2017 NEW YORK (Reuters Health) -
