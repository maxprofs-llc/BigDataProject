Limited evidence exists on individual perceptions about the cost, actual spending and consumption of F&V. This study investigated perceptions and beliefs about cost of F&V and whether this is a barrier to higher consumption.\nAn online survey of Australian adults (n\u00a0=\u00a02474) measured F&V consumption; expenditure on F&V and food; and perceived barriers to consumption. Multivariable logistic regression examined associations between participants' responses about cost of F&V and demographic factors, and with actual consumption and expenditure on F&V.\nCost was identified as a barrier for 29% of people not meeting recommended fruit servings and for 14% of people not meeting recommendations for vegetables. Cost was a more common barrier for those on lower incomes (fruit aOR 1.89; 95% CI 1.20-2.98 and vegetables aOR 2.94; 95% CI 1.97-4.39) and less common for older participants (fruit aOR 0.33; 95% CI 0.17-0.62 and vegetables aOR 0.31; 95% CI 0.18-0.52). There was no association between the perceived barriers and actual F&V spending. Twenty percent of participants said F&V were not affordable; 39% said cost made it difficult to buy F&V, and for 23% the cost of F&V meant they bought less than desired.\nA minority reported F&V were not affordable where they shopped and that cost was a barrier to higher consumption. However, it is apparent that young adults and those on low incomes eat less than they would like because of cost. Strategies that remove financial impediments to consumption are indicated for these population sub-groups.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022c3","authors":["Chapman, Kathryn","Goldsbury, David","Watson, Wendy","Havill, Michelle","Wellard, Lyndal","Hughes, Clare","Bauman, Adrian","Allman-Farinelli, Margaret"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.appet.2017.02.043","first_seen_on":"2017-03-02T19:21:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["01956663","1095-8304"],"journal":"Appetite","last_mentioned_on":1490027514,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0195666316306225"],"pmid":"28263775","pubdate":"2017-03-07T22:01:25+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Exploring perceptions and beliefs about the cost of fruit and vegetables and whether they are barriers to higher consumption","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exploring-perceptions-beliefs-about-cost-fruit-vegetables-whether-barriers-higher-consumption"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.15,"score_history":{"1y":5.15,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.15},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8389481,"mean":7.0670107241375,"rank":1603871,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6783488,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8389481,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243812,"mean":13.739286414476,"rank":67013,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":176674,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243812,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2395,"mean":16.964888888889,"rank":1016,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":1377,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2395,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101,"mean":18.41576,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":59,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":5,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Social Sciences":1,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":6,"Unspecified":3,"Environmental Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":5},"mendeley":{"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DrSueRNutr\/statuses\/837382129998790656","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16939746],"posted_on":"2017-03-02T19:20:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr Sue Reeves","url":"http:\/\/www.roehampton.ac.uk","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/704614721929027584\/4sJt32ah_normal.jpg","description":"Registered Nutritionist and the Programme Convenor for the Nutrition and Health degree @RoehamptonUni","id_on_source":"DrSueRNutr","tweeter_id":"1248963488","geo":{"lt":51.50853,"ln":-0.12574,"country":"GB"},"followers":1115},"tweet_id":"837382129998790656"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/KatieLBarfoot_\/statuses\/837555209802915840","license":"gnip","rt":["DrSueRNutr"],"citation_ids":[16939746],"posted_on":"2017-03-03T06:48:17+00:00","author":{"name":"Katie Barfoot","url":"http:\/\/uk.linkedin.com\/pub\/katie-barfoot\/53\/4a8\/192\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/575603836020092928\/6TaTWDtg_normal.jpeg","description":"Nutritional Psychology Doctoral Researcher @UniRdg_Psych investigating the effects of food on children's brains.
