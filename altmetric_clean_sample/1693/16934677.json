On the one hand, proponents of the 'knowledge discourse' argue that nurses should drop the 'virtue script' and focus on the scientific and technical aspects of their work. On the other hand, proponents of the 'caring discourse' promote a view of nursing that embodies humanistic qualities such as compassion, empathy and mutuality. In view of this, we suggest a way to reconcile both discourses despite the fact that they appear to be at odds theoretically and practically. To that end, we argue that nursing theory must give a prominent role to the Aristotelian conception of virtue, and we offer an account that includes both character and intellectual virtues. This account allows for a focus on moral competence but also accommodates the demands for discipline-specific knowledge. Our account incorporates the caring discourse by suggesting a way for individuals to cultivate the conditions within themselves that make 'caring in nursing' possible, while the knowledge discourse is accommodated via the acquisition of the intellectual virtues. The process for achieving both these ends is the same: an intention to consistently develop, hone and exercise certain character traits over time.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5103cf058f61000320c","authors":["Bliss, Suzanne","Baltzly, Dirk","Bull, Rosalind","Dalton, Lisa","Jones, Jo"],"doi":"10.1111\/nin.12191","first_seen_on":"2017-03-02T14:59:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["13207881","1440-1800"],"journal":"Nursing Inquiry","last_mentioned_on":1490085621,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/nin.12191\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/nin.12191\/pdf","pmid":"28247531","pubdate":"2017-02-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing"],"title":"A role for virtue in unifying the \u2018knowledge\u2019 and \u2018caring\u2019 discourses in nursing theory","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/nin.12191","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-virtue-unifying-knowledge-caring-discourses-nursing-theory"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.2,"score_history":{"1y":4.2,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8392157,"mean":7.0686031077041,"rank":1820569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6560468,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8392157,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243868,"mean":13.740879462986,"rank":74702,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":168533,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243868,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":388,"mean":5.4540568475452,"rank":153,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":388,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":7.8323529411765,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":3,"US":1,"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NurseNerdy\/statuses\/837316159582040065","license":"gnip","rt":["NursingInquiry"],"citation_ids":[16934677],"posted_on":"2017-03-02T14:58:23+00:00","author":{"name":"Lori","url":"http:\/\/about.me\/loricampbell","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/699596962601967618\/aqB9nib1_normal.jpg","description":"Nurse and MSN student.
