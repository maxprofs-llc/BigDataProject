The pathophysiology and gut microbial alteration during inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are still not completely understood. Gut microbiota is implicated in most of the gastro-intestinal (GI) diseases including IBD. From the time of gut microbiota establishment and through aging, it undergoes a lot of changes in the composition.\nIn a healthy state, the composition of beneficial microbes in the gut is comparatively higher and due to factors such as malnutrition, use of antibiotics and any underlying diseases allow the colonization and invasion of pathogens.\nA careful manipulation of gut microbiota during disease conditions such as IBD is required. Probiotics are natural, safe and useful interventions for GI diseases.\nLactic acid probiotic bacteria have shown many beneficial effects in various gastrointestinal and inflammatory disorders. This review focuses on the use of probiotics in IBD and possible mechanism of probiotics in inflammation conditions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026ad","authors":["Ravichandra Vemuri","Rohit Gundamaraju","Rajaraman Eri"],"doi":"10.2174\/1381612823666170207100025","first_seen_on":"2017-03-10T23:36:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["13816128"],"journal":"Current Pharmaceutical Design","last_mentioned_on":1489188951,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28176664\/?from=lactic+acid+bacteria+probiotic&i=17"],"pmid":"28176664","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Role of lactic acid probiotic bacteria in IBD","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.eurekaselect.com\/openurl\/content.php?genre=article&doi=10.2174\/1381612823666170207100025","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-lactic-acid-probiotic-bacteria-ibd"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336644,"mean":7.0294968595789,"rank":7207969,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336644,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242034,"mean":13.666262517921,"rank":201347,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242034,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1527,"mean":4.6559541284404,"rank":1196,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1527,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.9880952380952,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
