The optimum aerosol delivery system, however, has not been identified and there are many challenges in delivering drugs effectively to the lower airways of intubated neonates. The effectiveness of surfactant in prematurely born infants and nitric oxide has been robustly investigated. Other drugs are being used on very limited evidence.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002304","authors":["Anne Greenough","Niovi Papalexopoulou"],"doi":"10.1136\/archdischild-2016-311711","first_seen_on":"2017-03-10T21:38:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1359-2998","1468-2052"],"journal":"Archives of Disease in Childhood -- Fetal & Neonatal Edition","last_mentioned_on":1489183031,"links":["http:\/\/fn.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2017\/03\/07\/archdischild-2016-311711"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/fn.bmj.com\/content\/fetalneonatal\/early\/2017\/03\/07\/archdischild-2016-311711.full.pdf","pmid":"28270430","pubdate":"2017-03-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"fetalneonatal-2016-311711","subjects":["perinatology","pediatrics"],"title":"The roles of drug therapy given via the endotracheal tube to neonates","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/fn.bmj.com\/lookup\/doi\/10.1136\/archdischild-2016-311711","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/roles-drug-therapy-given-via-endotracheal-tube-neonates"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336644,"mean":7.0294968595789,"rank":4442570,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2320312,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336644,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242033,"mean":13.666316090434,"rank":138696,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":80739,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242033,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":941,"mean":5.606314893617,"rank":645,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":196,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":941,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":6.3275,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ADC_FN\/statuses\/840315983017345024","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[17216628],"posted_on":"2017-03-10T21:38:37+00:00","author":{"name":"ADC F&N","url":"http:\/\/fn.bmj.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/784371168602165250\/VRFIVJuP_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"ADC_FN","tweeter_id":"3419696937","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":820},"tweet_id":"840315983017345024"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jonathan_davis3\/statuses\/840319036814581760","license":"gnip","rt":["ADC_FN"],"citation_ids":[17216628],"posted_on":"2017-03-10T21:50:45+00:00","author":{"name":"Jonathan Davis","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/771923275970703360\/VVj59Ba3_normal.jpg","description":"Medical director for NETS WA.
