Sangak and Bread roll were made with whole and white wheat flour, respectively. Whole-wheat flour had upper content of protein, sugar, ash, fiber, damaged starch and the activity of amylase than the white wheat flour. After 24\u00a0h of fermentation, the pH values of the sourdoughs made from whole-wheat flour (3.00, 2.90) were lower, in compared to sourdoughs prepared from white wheat flour (3.60, 3.58). In addition, in Sangak bread, glucose, and fructose were completely utilized after fermentation, but in bread roll, the reduced sugar levels increased after fermentation and baking that represent microorganisms cannot be activated and utilized sugars. Acrylamide formation was impacted by pH of sourdough and total reducing sugar (r\u00a0=\u00a00.915, r\u00a0=\u00a00.885 respectively). Bread roll and Sangak bread were fermented by L. casei- casei contained lowest acrylamide content, in two bread types (219.1, 104.3\u00a0\u03bcg\/kg respectively). As an important result, the acrylamide content of Sangak bread in all cases was lower than in the Bread roll.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c8c","authors":["Dastmalchi, Farnaz","Razavi, Seyed Hadi","Faraji, Mohammad","Labbafi, Mohsen"],"doi":"10.1007\/s13197-015-2118-3","endpage":"1539","first_seen_on":"2016-08-30T14:44:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0022-1155","0975-8402"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Food Science and Technology","last_mentioned_on":1472568257,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27570278?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27570278","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemistry\/Food Science, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Food Science","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nutrition","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"1531","title":"Effect of Lactobacillus casei- casei and Lactobacillus reuteri on acrylamide formation in flat bread and Bread roll","type":"article","volume":"53","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-lactobacillus-casei-casei-lactobacillus-reuteri-acrylamide-formation-flat-bread-bread-roll"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8302052,"mean":6.9984430163018,"rank":7178683,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8302052,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251588,"mean":12.499570057276,"rank":211233,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251588,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":458,"mean":3.4192560175055,"rank":255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":458,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":3.5,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/wheat_papers\/statuses\/770633242953195520","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10910757],"posted_on":"2016-08-30T14:44:17+00:00","author":{"name":"wheatpapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/570928252454055936\/nyIDp8RF_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"wheat_papers","tweeter_id":"3062846807","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":245},"tweet_id":"770633242953195520"}]}}
