The disorder is enigmatic yet devastating because of its elusive etiology, irreversible erectile tissue damage, and resultant erectile dysfunction (ED). Current management strategies suffer from a poor understanding of the pathophysiology, especially at the molecular level. The traditional treatments are based more on empirical rather than evidence-based knowledge. The outcomes for restoration of normal erectile function are poor, especially for stuttering priapism. Therefore, it is critical to understand priapism from a molecular level, to formulate treatment strategies and to establish rational prevention strategies for high-risk populations, such as sickle cell disease (SCD) patients and cases of the stuttering variant. This review focuses on the recent advances at the molecular level in priapism and penile erection, and applies the recent knowledge to the treatment of stuttering priapism.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006b55","authors":["Jiuhong Yuan","Rowena DeSouza","O.
