A PubMed search restricted to titles and abstracts of English-language reviews, meta-analyses, clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, journal articles, and letters using human participants was conducted on August 7, 2015, using keywords that included \"binge eating disorder,\" DSM-5, DSM-IV, guilt, shame, embarrassment, quantity, psychological, behavior, and \"shape and weight concerns.\" Of the 257 retrieved publications, 60 publications were considered relevant to discussions related to DSM-5 diagnostic criteria and were included in the current review, and 20 additional references were also included on the basis of the authors' knowledge and\/or on a review of the reference lists from relevant articles obtained through the literature search. Evidence supports the duration\/frequency criterion for BED and the primary importance of loss of control and marked distress in identifying individuals with BED. Although overvaluation of shape\/weight is not a diagnostic criterion, its relationship to the severity of BED psychopathology may identify a unique subset of individuals with BED. Additionally, individuals with BED often exhibit a clinical profile consisting of psychiatric (eg, mood, obsessive-compulsive, and impulsive disorders) and medical (eg, gastrointestinal symptoms, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes) comorbidities and behavioral profiles (eg, overconsumption of calories outside of a binge eating episode and emotional eating). Future revisions of the BED diagnostic criteria should consider the inclusion of BED subtypes, perhaps based on the overvaluation of shape\/weight, and an evidence-based reassessment of severity criteria.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f6100082a9","authors":["Denise Wilfley","Leslie Citrome","Barry Herman","Wilfley, Denise E","Citrome, Leslie","Herman, Barry K"],"doi":"10.2147\/ndt.s107777","endpage":"2223","first_seen_on":"2016-08-30T16:50:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1178-2021","1176-6328"],"journal":"Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1474224355,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/characteristics-of-binge-eating-disorder-in-relation-to-diagnostic-cri-peer-reviewed-article-NDT?utm_content=buffere8f9c&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/characteristics-of-binge-eating-disorder-in-relation-to-diagnostic-cri-peer-reviewed-article-NDT","https:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.2147\/NDT.S107777","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27621631"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=32114","pmid":"27621631","pubdate":"2016-08-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"2213","title":"Characteristics of binge eating disorder in relation to diagnostic criteria","type":"article","volume":"Volume 12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characteristics-binge-eating-disorder-relation-diagnostic-criteria"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8396916,"mean":7.0724322720827,"rank":1834113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6552175,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8396916,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252413,"mean":12.527029198294,"rank":72464,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":179405,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252413,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1610,"mean":5.2719763828465,"rank":338,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":1265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1610,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107,"mean":5.0864150943396,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":78,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
