Our objectives are to replicate the analysis, re-analyze the data, and offer a critique of the key flaws of the Koch study.\nWe used corrected maternal mortality data (2006-2013), live births, and state-level indicators of poverty. We replicate the published analysis. We then re- classified state-level exposure to abortion on demand based on actual availability of abortion (Mexico City versus the other 31 states) and test the association of abortion access and the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) using descriptives over time, pooled chi-square tests and regression models. We included 256 state-year observations.\nWe did not find significant differences in MMR between M\u00e9xico City (MMR=49.1) and the 31 states (MMR=44.6; p=0.44). Using Koch's classification of states, we replicated published differences of higher MMR where abortion is more available. We found a significant, negative association between MMR and availability of abortion in the same multivariable models as Koch, but using our state classification (beta = -22.49, 95% CI = -38.9 - 15.99). State-level poverty remains highly correlated with MMR.\nKoch makes errors in methodology and interpretation, making false causal claims about abortion law and MMR. MMR is falling most rapidly in Mexico City, but our main study limitation is an inability to draw causal inference about abortion law or access and maternal mortality. We need rigorous evidence about the health impacts of increasing access to safe abortion worldwide.\nTransparency and integrity in research is crucial, and perhaps even more in politically contested topics such as abortion. Rigorous evidence about the health impacts of increasing access to safe abortion worldwide is needed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f61000376a","authors":["Blair G.
