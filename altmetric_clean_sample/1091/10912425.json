Hence, coagulin-l, a withanolide isolated from Withania coagulans Dunal has been studied for such an effect in human and murine cells, and mice model. Coagulin-l (1, 3, 10\u03bcM) exhibited immunomodulatory effect by suppressing TLR4 induced immune mediators such as cytokines (GMCSF, IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03b3, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1R\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-2R, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-12 (p40\/p70), IL-13, IL-15, IL-17), chemokines (IL-8\/CXCL8, MIG\/CXCL9, IP-10\/CXCL10, KC, MCP-1\/CCL2, MIP-1\u03b1\/CCL3, MIP-1\u03b2\/CCL4, RANTES\/CCL5, eotaxin\/CCL11), growth factors (FGF-basic, VEGF), nitric oxide and intracellular superoxide. Mechanistically, coagulin-l abrogated LPS induced total and mitochondrial ROS generation, NOX2, NOX4 mRNA expression, IRAK and MAPK (p38, JNK, ERK) activation. Coagulin-l also attenuated I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation, which prevented NF\u03baB downstream iNOS expression and pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Furthermore, coagulin-L (10, 25, 50mg\/kg, p.o.), undermined the LPS (10mg\/kg, i.p.) induced endotoxemia response in mice as evinced from diminished cytokine release, nitric oxide, aortic p38 MAPK activation and endothelial tissue impairment besides suppressing NOX2 and NOX4 expression in liver and aorta. Moreover, coagulin-l also alleviated the ROS mediated oxidative damage which was assessed through protein carbonyl, lipid hydroperoxide, 8-isoprostane and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine quantification. To extend, coagulin-l also suppressed carrageenan-induced paw edema and thioglycollate-induced peritonitis in mice. Therefore, coagulin-l can be of therapeutic importance in pathological conditions induced by oxidative damage.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f61000367a","authors":["Reddy, Sukka Santosh","Chauhan, Parul","Maurya, Preeti","Saini, Deepika","Yadav, Prem Prakash","Barthwal, Manoj Kumar"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.taap.2016.08.022","first_seen_on":"2016-08-30T16:43:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1096-0333"],"journal":"Toxicology & Applied Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1472575362,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27568862?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27568862","pubdate":"2016-08-30T22:05:28+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Coagulin-l ameliorates TLR4 induced oxidative damage and immune response by regulating mitochondria and NOX-derived ROS.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/coagulinl-ameliorates-tlr4-induced-oxidative-damage-immune-response-regulating-mitochondria-noxderiv"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8302052,"mean":6.9984430163018,"rank":7178673,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8302052,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251587,"mean":12.499575222786,"rank":211230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251587,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3779,"mean":4.1108967707782,"rank":3547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3779,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":3.4233333333333,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
