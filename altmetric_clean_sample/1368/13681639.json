However, the synthesis of high-quality monolayer or few-layer antimonenes, sparsely reported, has greatly hindered the development of this new field. Here, we report the van der Waals epitaxy growth of few-layer antimonene monocrystalline polygons, their atomical microstructure and stability in ambient condition. The high-quality, few-layer antimonene monocrystalline polygons can be synthesized on various substrates, including flexible ones, via van der Waals epitaxy growth. Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy reveal that the obtained antimonene polygons have buckled rhombohedral atomic structure, consistent with the theoretically predicted most stable \u03b2-phase allotrope. The very high stability of antimonenes was observed after aging in air for 30 days. First-principle and molecular dynamics simulation results confirmed that compared with phosphorene, antimonene is less likely to be oxidized and possesses higher thermodynamic stability in oxygen atmosphere at room temperature. Moreover, antimonene polygons show high electrical conductivity up to 10(4)\u2009S\u2009m(-1) and good optical transparency in the visible light range, promising in transparent conductive electrode applications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Jianping Ji","Xiufeng Song","Jizi Liu","Zhong Yan","Chengxue Huo","Shengli Zhang","Meng Su","Lei Liao","Wenhui Wang","Zhenhua Ni","Yufeng Hao","Haibo Zeng"],"doi":"10.1038\/ncomms13352","first_seen_on":"2016-11-16T10:47:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","last_mentioned_on":1489681800,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/ncomms13352","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/doi:10.1038\/ncomms13352","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/ncomms13352"],"pmid":"27845327","pubdate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"13352","subjects":["science","biology"],"title":"Two-dimensional antimonene single crystals grown by van der Waals epitaxy","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/twodimensional-antimonene-single-crystals-grown-van-der-waals-epitaxy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":21.54,"score_history":{"1y":21.54,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":21.54},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366012,"mean":7.0543497525808,"rank":410186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":7955907,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366012,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":216588,"mean":13.332741254092,"rank":19965,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":196623,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":216588,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13064,"mean":44.671580953839,"rank":4946,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":8118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13064,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":809,"mean":60.963138613861,"rank":376,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":433,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":809,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":17,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
