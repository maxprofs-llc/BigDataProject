We consider a broad definition of big data for public health, one encompassing patient information gathered from high-volume electronic health records and participatory surveillance systems, as well as mining of digital traces such as social media, Internet searches, and cell-phone logs. We introduce nine independent contributions to this special issue and highlight several cross-cutting areas that require further research, including representativeness, biases, volatility, and validation, and the need for robust statistical and hypotheses-driven analyses. Overall, we are optimistic that the big-data revolution will vastly improve the granularity and timeliness of available epidemiological information, with hybrid systems augmenting rather than supplanting traditional surveillance systems, and better prospects for accurate infectious diseases models and forecasts.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002df6","authors":["Shweta Bansal","Gerardo Chowell","Lone Simonsen","Alessandro Vespignani","C\u00e9cile Viboud","Bansal, Shweta","Chowell, Gerardo","Simonsen, Lone","Vespignani, Alessandro","Viboud, C\u00e9cile"],"doi":"10.1093\/infdis\/jiw400","endpage":"S379","first_seen_on":"2016-11-16T12:55:16+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms"],"handles":[],"issns":["1537-6613","0022-1899"],"issue":"suppl 4","journal":"Journal of Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1503890944,"links":["http:\/\/jid.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/214\/suppl_4\/S375.full.pdf+html","http:\/\/jid.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/214\/suppl_4\/S375.abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/infdis\/jiw400","http:\/\/jid.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/214\/suppl_4\/S375.long","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jid\/article\/214\/suppl_4\/S375\/2527914\/Big-Data-for-Infectious-Disease-Surveillance-and","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jid\/article\/214\/suppl_4\/S375\/2527914\/Big-Data-for-Infectious-Disease-Surveillance-and#.WKPIw_RqJ9o.twitter","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jid\/article\/214\/suppl_4\/S375\/2527914\/Big-Data-for-Infectious-Disease-Surveillance-and#.WKPI1SrwryE.twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28830113?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28830113?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jid.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/214\/suppl_4\/S375.full.pdf","pmid":"28830113","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"S375","subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Big Data for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Modeling","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jid\/article-lookup\/doi\/10.1093\/infdis\/jiw400","volume":"214","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/big-data-infectious-disease-surveillance-modeling-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":83.3,"score_history":{"1y":83.3,"6m":9.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":83.3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8440126,"mean":7.0979478654558,"rank":109195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":8331103,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8440126,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":217508,"mean":13.352464077018,"rank":6807,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":210696,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":217508,"percentile":96},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6959,"mean":6.6106700201207,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":6891,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6959,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":15.454477272727,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":86,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":10,"researcher":3,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":10,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
