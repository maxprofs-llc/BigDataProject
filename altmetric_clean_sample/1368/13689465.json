In this study, we investigated the effect of observer experience on interobserver and intraobserver agreement in C:D ratio estimation.\nNine 3rd-year (Yr3) and nine 4th-year (Yr4) optometry students and nine optometrists (Opt), determined C:D ratios from 26 optic disc photographs viewed monoscopically and stereoscopically. Observer agreement was investigated using weighted kappa (Kw) analysis.\nInterobserver agreement was higher (p < 0.01) among optometrists than among 4th-year students and higher (p < 0.01) among 4th-year than among 3rd-year students (mean Kw: Opt = 0.61; Yr4 = 0.51; Yr3 = 0.39). Stereoscopic estimates of C:D ratios were higher (p < 0.0001) than monoscopic estimates, and interobserver agreement was higher (p < 0.001) when evaluating the vertical rather than the horizontal C:D ratio. Intraobserver agreement (mean Kw: Opt = 0.67; Yr4 = 0.66; Yr3 = 0.62) did not vary significantly (p = 0.78) with experience.\nThe extent to which an observer reproducibly assesses the C:D ratio from optic disc photographs (intraobserver agreement) does not increase with experience. However, the agreement between different observers in assessing the C:D ratio (interobserver agreement) increases with experience.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f6100083e1","authors":["Hanson, S","Krishnan, S K","Phillips, J","STEVEN HANSON","SOWMYA KUMARA KRISHNAN","JOHN PHILLIPS"],"doi":"10.1097\/00006324-200110000-00009","endpage":"705","first_seen_on":"2016-11-16T13:54:27+00:00","issns":["1040-5488"],"issue":"10","journal":"Optometry and Vision Science","last_mentioned_on":1199145600,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1097\/00006324-200110000-00009"],"pmid":"11700963","pubdate":"2001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"701","subjects":["optometry"],"title":"Observer Experience and Cup:Disc Ratio Assessment","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/content.wkhealth.com\/linkback\/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&an=00006324-200110000-00009","volume":"78","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/observer-experience-cup-disc-ratio-assessment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6997391,"mean":6.2536721123135,"rank":1638992,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":4548803,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6997391,"percentile":65},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192307,"mean":12.55991361684,"rank":63467,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":126209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192307,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1118,"mean":5.2280322291853,"rank":172,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":824,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1118,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":8.4921818181818,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
