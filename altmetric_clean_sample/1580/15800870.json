After exposing the trapeziometacarpal (TMC) joint, we placed Kirschner wires in the distal radius and thumb metacarpal. The rotation shear test was then performed to test the joint axial laxity, and angular measurements using Kirschner wires as reference points were documented. The dorsoradial (DR) ligament and capsule were released, followed by the intermetacarpal (IM) ligament; angular measurements were obtained. Finally, the DR capsulodesis procedure was performed, and final measurements were obtained. Comparisons were made among the various stages of ligament integrity to determine the amount of stability provided by DR capsulodesis.\nAll cadavers demonstrated axial laxity with transection of the DR ligament; an increase in stability was obtained after DR capsulodesis. Transection of the capsule and IM ligament caused increased laxity relative to the native joint (median, 24\u00b0 and 35\u00b0, respectively, on rotational testing). After we performed DR capsulodesis, rotational stability improved by a median of 41\u00b0 compared with DR ligament transection, 49\u00b0 compared with DR and IM ligament transection, and 18\u00b0 relative to the native joint.\nDorsoradial capsulodesis restores rotational stability for TMC joint after division of the DR and IM ligaments. The stability achieved was statistically significant compared with both an intact native TMC joint and induced laxity of the TMC joint.\nThe DR capsulodesis procedure may improve rotational stability to the TMC joint.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008e50","authors":["Brian A.
