For many cases, a pathway to produce a target molecule consists of both native and heterologous reactions when utilizing a microbial organism as the host organism. Due to tens of thousands of biosynthetic reactions existed in nature, it's not trivial to identify which could be served as heterologous ones to produce the target molecule in a specific organism. In the present work, we integrate more than ten thousand of E. coli non-native reactions and utilize a probability-based algorithm to search pathway. Moreover, we build a user friendly web server named EcoSynther. It is able to explore the precursors and heterologous reactions needed to produce a target molecule in Escherichia coli K12 MG1655, and then applies flux balance analysis to calculate theoretical yields of each candidate pathway. Compared with other chassis-centered biosynthetic pathway design tools, EcoSynther has two unique features: (1) allow for automatic search without knowing a precursor in E. coli and (2) evaluate the candidate pathways under constraints from E. coli physiological states and growth conditions.
