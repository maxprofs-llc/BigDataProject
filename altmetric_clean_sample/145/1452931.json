A total of 614 male patients with ED and a normal or low T level in association with normal or elevated E2 levels were enrolled. Patients underwent routine laboratory investigations in addition to measurements of total T, total E2, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and prolactin. We compared the responses to the erectile function domain, Q3 (achieving erection) and Q4 (maintaining erection) of the International Index for Erectile Function (IIEF) score in patients with the following: normal T and E2 levels; low T level; low T level and elevated E2 level; and elevated E2 level. Of the patients included, 449 (73.1%) had normal T and E2 levels, 110 (17.9%) had a low T level, 36 (5.9%) had a low T level and an elevated E2 level, and 19 (3.1%) had an elevated E2 level. Increased ED severity was significantly associated with low T levels, elevated E2 levels, and both a low T level and an elevated E2 level. Additionally, the mean values of the EF-domain, Q3 and Q4 were significantly lower in patients with both a low T level and an elevated E2 level compared to patients with any condition alone. In conclusion, a low T level had the primary effect on erectile function; however, a concomitantly elevated E2 level had an additive impairment effect.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006b55","authors":["Ahmed I El-Sakka"],"doi":"10.1038\/aja.2013.20","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2013-05-07T13:50:05+00:00","issns":["1008-682X","1745-7262"],"journal":"Asian Journal of Andrology","last_mentioned_on":1367934461,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/aja\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/aja201320a.html"],"pmid":"23644871","pubdate":"2013-05-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"","subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Impact of the association between elevated oestradiol and low testosterone levels on erectile dysfunction severity","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-association-between-elevated-oestradiol-low-testosterone-levels-erectile-dysfunction-severity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634915,"mean":4.919334042571,"rank":2695686,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":894218,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634915,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84997,"mean":6.8276258176857,"rank":59722,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":23808,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84997,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263,"mean":3.2476870229008,"rank":175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":82,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":2.1705882352941,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Asian Journal of Andrology - Impact of the association between elevated oestradiol and low testoster","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/100000559797692\/posts\/616094905085830","license":"public","citation_ids":[1452931],"posted_on":"2013-05-07T13:47:25+00:00","summary":"Our aim was to assess the impact of the association between elevated oestradiol (E2) and low testosterone (T) levels on erectile dysfunction (ED) severity.
