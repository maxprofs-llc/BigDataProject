Considerable scientific data concerning the biopsychosocial impact of botulinum toxin use have become available. The bidirectional interaction of mimic and emotion, described as the facial feedback hypothesis, is particularly influenced, as is mimicry. Furthermore, botulinum toxin can cause dysfunction of face harmony including false laughing or the \"frozen face\". As a result, complex psychosocial disturbances can occur and may affect social interaction and cause flattening of affect. Thus one must ask whether in the future botulinum toxin will continue to be employed in aesthetic dermatology or perhaps be regarded as a misguided path.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61a3cf058f6100075db","authors":["Harth W"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00105-012-2493-x","first_seen_on":"2013-05-07T15:50:08+00:00","issns":["0017-8470"],"issue":"","journal":"Der Hautarzt","last_mentioned_on":1368339535,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23636411"],"pmid":"23636411","pubdate":"2013-05-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Allergology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Dermatology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Proctology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"[Botulinum toxin: the misguided path.]","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/botulinumtoxin-als-irrweg"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632750,"mean":4.9231796234803,"rank":1806686,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1648880,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632750,"percentile":45},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84982,"mean":6.8320810534121,"rank":37733,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":42094,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84982,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150,"mean":2.3019865771812,"rank":70,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":74,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":2.75,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ducrest\/statuses\/331797375830073345","license":"public","citation_ids":[1453323],"posted_on":"2013-05-07T15:47:13+00:00","author":{"name":"Dominique du Crest","url":"http:\/\/www.skinaid.eu\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1474773419\/image_normal.jpg","description":"#Evidence as guiding star!Curating #skin science.
