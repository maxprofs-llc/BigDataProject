However, detection of negative selection has been notoriously difficult, partly because negatively selected alleles are usually rare in the population and have little impact on either population dynamics or the shape of the gene genealogy. Recently, through studies of genetic disorders and genome-wide analyses, many structural variations were shown to occur recurrently in the population. Such \"recurrent mutations\" might be revealed as deleterious by exploiting the signal of negative selection in the gene genealogy enhanced by their recurrence.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b8","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2156-14-37","first_seen_on":"2013-05-08T20:10:10+00:00","issns":["1471-2156"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1376309949,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2156\/14\/37\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2156-14-37.pdf","pmid":"23651527","pubdate":"2013-05-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"37","subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"Detecting negative selection on recurrent mutations using gene genealogy","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/detecting-negative-selection-recurrent-mutations-using-gene-genealogy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":1132291,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":3898058,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93030,"mean":7.2538349546917,"rank":22981,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":69829,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93030,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":552,"mean":3.1334228675136,"rank":106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":443,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":552,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":2.924,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":4,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
