Journal of Medical Ethics"],"citation":{"abstract":"This paper is primarily about the personal and public responsibilities of ethics and of ethicists in speaking, writing and commenting publicly about issues of ethical, political and social significance. The paper argues that any such interventions are 'willy-nilly', actually or potentially, in the public domain in ways that make any self-conscious decision about intended publics or audiences problematic. In it is argued that a famous, and hitherto useful, distinction relating to the ethical limitations on freedom of speech which we owe to John Stuart Mill may, because of the emergence of 'the cloud' have become redundant or inoperable.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e41","authors":["John Harris"],"doi":"10.1136\/medethics-2012-100862","first_seen_on":"2013-05-08T12:36:27+00:00","issns":["1473-4257"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Medical Ethics","last_mentioned_on":1368019666,"links":["http:\/\/jme.bmj.com\/content\/39\/5\/307.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jme.bmj.com\/content\/39\/5\/307.full.pdf","pmid":"23637436","pubdate":"2013-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd and Institute of Medical Ethics","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Applied Ethics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Nursing","Social Sciences"],"startpage":"307","subjects":["ethics"],"title":"Life in the cloud and freedom of speech","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/life-cloud-freedom-speech"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":1750884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":2748166,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88881,"mean":7.089161138614,"rank":30655,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":57979,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88881,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1316,"mean":9.2077718631179,"rank":711,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":602,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1316,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65,"mean":13.03996875,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Philosophy":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":2},"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ScienceEthics\/statuses\/332110889736081408","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1457248],"posted_on":"2013-05-08T12:33:01+00:00","author":{"name":"Science Ethics","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/892316863002279936\/F3sMVORh_normal.jpg","description":"News, debates, scholarship and more from the world of bioethics #bioethics","id_on_source":"ScienceEthics","tweeter_id":"350942015","geo":{"lt":53.48095,"ln":-2.23743,"country":"GB"},"followers":1278},"tweet_id":"332110889736081408"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Biojammer\/statuses\/332114440415752192","license":"public","rt":["ScienceEthics"],"citation_ids":[1457248],"posted_on":"2013-05-08T12:47:07+00:00","author":{"name":"David Lawrence","url":"http:\/\/www.biojammer.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2659577091\/09f9c155e5fa763bc50e578519766bce_normal.jpeg","description":"REA Fellow @LisNCL.
