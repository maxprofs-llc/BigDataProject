Environmental justice is proposed as an alternative to mainstream environmentalism, one that seeks to address systemic social and spatial exclusion encountered by many racialized immigrants in Toronto as a result of neo-liberal and green capitalist municipal policy and that seeks to position marginalized communities as valued contributors to energy solutions. We examine Toronto-based municipal state initiatives aimed at reducing energy use while concurrently stimulating growth (specifically, green economy\/green jobs and 'smart growth'). By treating these as instruments of green capitalism, we illustrate the utility of environmental justice applied to energy-related problems and as a means to analyze stakeholders' positions in the context of neo-liberalism and green capitalism, and as opening possibilities for resistance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61d3cf058f6100078a4","authors":["Cheryl Teelucksingh","Blake Poland"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijerph8010185","first_seen_on":"2013-05-06T21:51:21+00:00","issns":["1661-7827"],"issue":"1","journal":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1361397345,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3037069\/"],"pmcid":"PMC3037069","pmid":"21318023","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"185","subjects":["publichealth","environmentalhealth"],"title":"Energy Solutions, Neo-Liberalism, and Social Diversity in Toronto, Canada","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/energy-solutions-neoliberalism-social-diversity-toronto-canada"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4282690,"mean":5.0215424405332,"rank":3397989,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":123826,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4282690,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":87667,"mean":6.810115483768,"rank":68354,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":515,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":87667,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1287,"mean":6.5752083981337,"rank":990,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1287,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":5.43,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
