By 1987, the Malays experienced the highest fertility and the Chinese the lowest in both countries but in Singapore the Malay fertility was lower than the Chinese fertility in Peninsular Malaysia. The fertility differentials will lead to changes in the ethnic composition in both countries but more so in Peninsular Malaysia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4de3cf058f610001cbb","authors":["Saw, S H"],"first_seen_on":"2013-05-07T14:40:29+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0021-9320"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Biosocial Science","last_mentioned_on":1251228120,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2298755"],"pmid":"2298755","pubdate":"1990-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["socialsciences"],"title":"Ethnic fertility differentials in Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore.","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ethnic-fertility-differentials-peninsular-malaysia-singapore"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.16,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.16},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685988,"mean":4.9540738657005,"rank":583190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":3102266,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685988,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85265,"mean":6.8390699474572,"rank":16245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":69017,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85265,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":166,"mean":3.0847151515152,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":141,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":166,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":4.8375,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
