Results are explained in terms of the calculated spatial distribution of the electric field intensity within the configurations under analysis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Miguel Anaya","Mauricio Ernesto Calvo","Jos\u00e9 Miguel Luque-Raigon","Hernan Miguez"],"doi":"10.1021\/ja401096k","first_seen_on":"2013-05-08T10:22:46+00:00","issns":["0002-7863","1520-5126"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1368008383,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ja401096k?mi=vvujsg&af=R&pageSize=20&publication=40001010&searchText=synthesis"],"pmid":"23651222","pubdate":"2013-05-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"130507145421000","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Resonant Photocurrent Generation in Dye-Sensitized Periodically Nanostructured Photoconductors by Optical Field Confinement Effects","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/resonant-photocurrent-generation-dyesensitized-periodically-nanostructured-photoconductors-optical-f"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629240,"mean":4.9358355666342,"rank":2016319,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":938903,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629240,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84871,"mean":6.8527340638625,"rank":43963,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":25215,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84871,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12982,"mean":4.1063260149449,"rank":8144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":2420,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12982,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":596,"mean":4.216443697479,"rank":329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":596,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
