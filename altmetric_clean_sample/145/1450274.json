Since its introduction in the USA around 1990, uptake of PSA testing has been rapid in the USA, but much less common in the UK. Our aim was to study trends over time in prostate-cancer mortality and incidence in the USA and UK in 1975-2004, and compare these patterns with trends in screening and treatment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fd1","authors":["Collin SM","Martin RM","Metcalfe C","Gunnell D","Albertsen PC","Neal D","Hamdy F","Stephens P","Lane JA","Moore R","Donovan J","Simon M Collin","Richard M Martin","Chris Metcalfe","David Gunnell","Peter C Albertsen","David Neal","Freddie Hamdy","Peter Stephens","J Athene Lane","Rollo Moore","Jenny Donovan"],"doi":"10.1016\/s1470-2045(08)70104-9","endpage":"452","first_seen_on":"2013-05-06T16:53:39+00:00","issns":["1470-2045","14702045"],"issue":"5","journal":"Lancet Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1496851669,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6W85-4S9CXM3-1&_user=546868&_coverDate=05\/31\/2008&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000027971&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=546868&md5=c3b201b03fe0aca0eca0e59bd8be0593","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1470204508701049"],"pmcid":"PMC2760747","pmid":"18424233","pubdate":"2008-04-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"445","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Prostate-cancer mortality in the USA and UK in 1975\u20132004: an ecological study ","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1470204508701049","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prostatecancer-mortality-usa-uk-19752004-ecological-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.248,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.248},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8355597,"mean":7.0463814985712,"rank":1079352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7276058,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8355597,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121358,"mean":7.031571446229,"rank":16849,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":104506,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121358,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3580,"mean":18.232333053926,"rank":1226,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":2354,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3580,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77,"mean":6.8069736842105,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":69,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":10,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":20,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
