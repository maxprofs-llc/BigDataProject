From 2007, the same multiple malaria interventions, though reduced in scope for funding reasons, were introduced to the four mainland provinces of Equatorial Guinea (the continental region) aiming to recreate Bioko's success. Two provinces received long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and two provinces received biannual indoor residual spraying (IRS). Enhanced case management and communications were introduced throughout.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000086b","doi":"10.1186\/1475-2875-12-154","first_seen_on":"2013-05-08T10:35:47+00:00","issns":["1475-2875"],"issue":"1","journal":"Malaria Journal","last_mentioned_on":1368019460,"links":["http:\/\/www.malariajournal.com\/content\/12\/1\/154\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.malariajournal.com\/content\/pdf\/1475-2875-12-154.pdf","pmid":"23651490","pubdate":"2013-05-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"154","title":"Five years of malaria control in the continental region, Equatorial Guinea","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/five-years-malaria-control-continental-region-equatorial-guinea"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5040289,"mean":5.9643426109799,"rank":1977848,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3030030,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5040289,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93001,"mean":7.2559638279571,"rank":31116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":61102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93001,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1999,"mean":3.9978778778779,"rank":859,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":1121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1999,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":3.235768115942,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":22,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
