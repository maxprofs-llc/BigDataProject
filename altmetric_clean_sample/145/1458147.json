African American and Puerto Rican adolescents were interviewed during three points in time (n = 463). Exposure to violent television programs in late adolescence predicted exposure to violent television programs in young adulthood, which in turn was related to tobacco\/marijuana use, nicotine dependence, and later drug dependence. Some policy and clinical implications suggest regulating the times when violent television programs are broadcast, creating developmentally targeted prevention\/treatment programs, and recognizing that watching violent television programs may serve as a cue regarding increased susceptibility to nicotine and drug dependence.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002222","authors":["David W.
