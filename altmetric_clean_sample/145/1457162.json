A Medicare shared savings program is established for accountable care organizations in the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. However, savings created by providers cannot be distinguished from the normal (random) variation in medical claims costs, setting up a classic principal-agent problem. To lessen the likelihood of paying undeserved bonuses, payers may pay bonuses only if observed savings exceed minimum levels. We study the trade-off between two types of errors in setting minimum savings requirements: paying bonuses when providers do not create savings and not paying bonuses when providers create savings.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f61000591a","authors":["Pope, Gregory C.","Kautter, John"],"doi":"10.1002\/hec.1793","endpage":"1347","first_seen_on":"2013-05-08T12:07:36+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1099-1050"],"issue":"11","journal":"Health economics (Online)","last_mentioned_on":1355815221,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/hec.1793\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/hec.1793\/pdf","pmid":"21971882","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Economics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1336","subjects":["healthservices"],"title":"MINIMUM SAVINGS REQUIREMENTS IN SHARED SAVINGS PROVIDER PAYMENT","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/minimum-savings-requirements-shared-savings-provider-payment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628758,"mean":4.9386506288559,"rank":328727,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":3269610,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628758,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84866,"mean":6.8557808990751,"rank":10577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":73980,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84866,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":594,"mean":5.8714333895447,"rank":125,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":433,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":594,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
