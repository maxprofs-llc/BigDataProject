Paper published on the reproductive biology of Greeneye Spurdogs."],"citation":{"abstract":"The reproduction of the greeneye spurdog Squalus chloroculus was studied based on animals caught in the multispecies and multi-gear southern and eastern scalefish and shark fishery on the upper continental slope off southern Australia. One hundred and ninety-nine females (502-990\u2009mm, total length, LT ) and 189 males (515-810\u2009mm LT ) were examined. The female reproductive cycle, based on 41 breeding animals, is continuous and triennial, with the pregnancy period estimated to be 31-34 months, seasonal and synchronous with the ovarian cycle; a third of the breeding female population is estimated to give birth between September and December each year. The estimated LT at which 50% of females are mature is 799\u2009mm (95% c.i.: 794, 804), whereas the LT at which 50% are maternal is 825\u2009mm (95% c.i.: 817-833), but these estimates are probably biased by the phenomenon of apparent change of LT at maternity and LT at maturity following severe length-selective fishing mortality. Litters ranged from four to 15 embryos with a 1:1 sex ratio, and litter size increased with maternal length. The breeding cycle of males is neither seasonal nor synchronous with the female cycle. The estimated LT of males where 50% are mature was 629\u2009mm (95% c.i.: 603, 645).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f43cf058f610002da9","authors":["Rochowski, B. E.
