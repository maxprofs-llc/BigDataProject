Improving the optical absorption properties of TiO2 nanomaterials has been successfully demonstrated to enhance their photocatalytic activities, especially in the report of black TiO2 nanoparticles. The recent progress in the investigation of black TiO2 nanomaterials has been reviewed here, and special emphasis has been given on their fabrication methods along with their various chemical\/physical properties and applications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024ee","authors":["Xiaobo Chen","Lei Liu","Fuqiang Huang"],"doi":"10.1039\/c4cs00330f","endpage":"1885","first_seen_on":"2015-01-21T17:22:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1460-4744","0306-0012"],"issue":"7","journal":"Chemical Society Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1489657204,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2015\/CS\/C4CS00330F","http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2015\/CS\/C4CS00330F#!divAbstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2015\/cs\/c4cs00330f","pmid":"25590565","pubdate":"2015-03-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1861","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Black titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanomaterials","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/xlink.rsc.org\/?DOI=C4CS00330F","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/black-titanium-dioxide-tio-sub2sub-nanomaterials"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366012,"mean":7.0543497525808,"rank":3968614,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4211802,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366012,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241551,"mean":8.1673471330988,"rank":101687,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":132224,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241551,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1394,"mean":3.4410739411342,"rank":749,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":607,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1394,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":2.133512195122,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
