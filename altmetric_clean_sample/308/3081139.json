Although we cannot control the genes that we are born with, we can often make decisions concerning genetic testing, disease prevention, and treatment. One might argue, therefore, that individuals should be treated as morally responsible for taking effective action in response to genetic risks factors, since genetically-based health risks are similar to other health risks. While this argument makes sense as an abstract, philosophical position, it is not a useful guide to public policy. Given these concerns, there is little society can or should do to encourage individuals to address their genetic risk factors, other than praising those who make prudent choices.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f61000148b","authors":["David B Resnik"],"doi":"10.1080\/14636778.2014.905195","first_seen_on":"2015-01-20T12:49:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1463-6778"],"issue":"2","journal":"New Genetics and Society","last_mentioned_on":1421756200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25598702"],"pmid":"25598702","pubdate":"2014-06-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Sociology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"History And Philosophy Of Specific Fields","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Social Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Genetics and Personal Responsibility for Health.","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genetics-personal-responsibility-health"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4758711,"mean":5.4938017449299,"rank":3279204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":881619,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4758711,"percentile":18},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159288,"mean":8.6577714942212,"rank":109688,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":32264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159288,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101,"mean":6.45534,"rank":80,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1.35,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":3,"Student  > Master":5,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Social Sciences":2,"Sports and Recreations":2,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":1,"Arts and Humanities":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IN":1},"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Peertechz\/status\/557512030895099904","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3081139],"posted_on":"2015-01-20T12:16:40+00:00","author":{"name":"Peertechz Pub PvtLtd","url":"https:\/\/www.peertechz.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/808685119959535616\/cV4vMlOy_normal.jpg","description":"Peertechz Publications Pvt.
