We present a unified framework for generalized Watterson estimators based on Maximum Composite Likelihood, which encompasses most of the existing estimators. We propose this class of unbiased estimators as generalized Watterson estimators for a large class of NGS data, including pools and trios. We also discuss the relation with the estimators that has been proposed in the literature and show that they admit two equivalent but seemingly different forms, deriving a set of combinatorial identities as a byproduct. Finally, we give a detailed treatment of Watterson estimators for single or multiple autopolyploid individuals.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003653","authors":["Ferretti L","Ramos-Onsins SE"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.tpb.2015.01.001","first_seen_on":"2015-01-21T16:17:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0040-5809"],"issue":"","journal":"Theoretical Population Biology","last_mentioned_on":1421581680,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25595553?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25595553?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25595553","pubdate":"2015-01-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ecological Applications","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ecology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical","reproductivemedicine"],"title":"A generalized Watterson estimator for next-generation sequencing: From trios to autopolyploids.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/generalized-watterson-estimator-nextgeneration-sequencing-trios-autopolyploids"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4748170,"mean":5.4893571279212,"rank":3091705,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1476338,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4748170,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":158952,"mean":8.6509900409561,"rank":102458,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":49464,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":158952,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":286,"mean":3.300098245614,"rank":223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":61,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":286,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":6.7316,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Psychology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/RajanChaudhari\/status\/556780037534261248","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3087896],"posted_on":"2015-01-18T11:48:00+00:00","author":{"name":"Rajan Chaudhari","url":"http:\/\/www.bioinfoneer.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/439390110141120513\/9rOVpTAA_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"RajanChaudhari","tweeter_id":"17750122","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":484},"tweet_id":"556780037534261248"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CompBiolPapers\/status\/556772376461844481","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3087896],"posted_on":"2015-01-18T11:17:33+00:00","author":{"name":"CompBiolPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/848199297611026432\/GiXZ3YhG_normal.jpg","description":"Feed for sequencing papers","id_on_source":"CompBiolPapers","tweeter_id":"2365948482","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":697},"tweet_id":"556772376461844481"}]}}
