MiR-155 is a kind of molecule with different functions, such as its role in proliferation, apoptosis, inflammation, differentiation, and immunity. One of its best known functions is apoptosis that affects on caspase-3 activity. The main aim of this study was evaluation of miR-155 inhibition effect on cell proliferation and apoptosis induction in Jurkat cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef5e2a83ee09648b4dda","authors":["Sh Alizadeh","S Kaviani","M Soleimani","S Abroun","Z Kashani-Khatib","A Asgharzadeh","H Dargahi","R Mousavi"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-20T19:09:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2008-8892"],"issue":"4","journal":"Iranian Journal of Pediatric Hematology Oncology ","last_mentioned_on":1421751985,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25598954?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25598954","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Mir-55 inhibition can reduce cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in Jurkat (Acute T cell Leukemia) cell line.","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mir55-inhibition-reduce-cell-proliferation-induce-apoptosis-jurkat-acute-t-cell-leukemia-cell-line"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4759395,"mean":5.7098541322724,"rank":3982601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4759395,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":166622,"mean":8.5540323728704,"rank":133621,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":166622,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
