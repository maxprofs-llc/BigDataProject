A brief history of this new science goes from the creation of the first artificial neuron in 1943 to the first artificial neural network application to genetic algorithms. The potential for a similar technology in medicine has immediately been identified by scientists and researchers. The possibility to store and process all medical knowledge has made this technology very attractive to assist or even surpass clinicians in reaching a diagnosis. Applications of AI in medicine include devices applied to clinical diagnosis in neurology and cardiopulmonary diseases, as well as the use of expert or knowledge-based systems in routine clinical use for diagnosis, therapeutic management and for prognostic evaluation. Biological applications include genome sequencing or DNA gene expression microarrays, modeling gene networks, analysis and clustering of gene expression data, pattern recognition in DNA and proteins, protein structure prediction. In the field of hematology the first devices based on AI have been applied to the routine laboratory data management. New tools concern the differential diagnosis in specific diseases such as anemias, thalassemias and leukemias, based on neural networks trained with data from peripheral blood analysis. A revolution in cancer diagnosis, including the diagnosis of hematological malignancies, has been the introduction of the first microarray based and bioinformatic approach for molecular diagnosis: a systematic approach based on the monitoring of simultaneous expression of thousands of genes using DNA microarray, independently of previous biological knowledge, analysed using AI devices. Using gene profiling, the traditional diagnostic pathways move from clinical to molecular based diagnostic systems.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029d6","authors":["Zini G"],"doi":"10.1080\/10245330410001727055","first_seen_on":"2015-01-21T17:45:13+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Hematology","last_mentioned_on":1421557648,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/16203606\/"],"pmid":"16203606","pubdate":"2005-01-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Artificial intelligence in hematology.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/artificial-intelligence-hematology"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7342039,"mean":6.3783632029643,"rank":3761570,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2059663,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7342039,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232760,"mean":7.8927199206047,"rank":115672,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":91139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232760,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":445,"mean":3.5794234234234,"rank":205,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":193,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":445,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.784375,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
