Different grating concepts for circularly polarized emission are introduced along with the presentation of simulations and experimental results. Fifth-order gratings achieve a degree of circular polarization of up to 86% within a 12\u00b0-wide core region of their emission lobes in the far field. For devices based on an alternative transverse grating design, degrees of circular polarization as high as 98% are demonstrated for selected far-field regions of the outcoupled THz radiation and within a collection half-angle of about 6\u00b0. Potential and limitations of integrated antenna gratings for polarization-controlled emission are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Rauter, P","Lin, J","Genevet, P","Khanna, SP","Lachab, M","Davies, AG","Linfield, EH","Capasso, F","Rauter P","Lin J","Genevet P","Khanna SP","Lachab M","Davies AG","Linfield EH","Capasso F","Patrick Rauter","Jiao Lin","Patrice Genevet","Suraj P.
