We generated a library of targeted deletion mutants in Salmonella Typhimurium strain ATCC14028, primarily in genes specific to Salmonella, that we have previously described. In the work presented here, we screened each individual mutant from this library for the ability to move away from the site of inoculation on swimming and swarming motility agar. Mutants in genes previously described as important for motility, such as flgF, motA, cheY are do not move away from the site of inoculation on plates in our screens, validating our approach. Mutants in 130 genes, not previously known to be involved in motility, had altered movement of at least one type, 9 mutants were severely impaired for both types of motility, while 33 mutants appeared defective on swimming motility plates but not swarming motility plates, and 49 mutants had reduced ability to move on swarming agar but not swimming agar. Finally, 39 mutants were determined to be hypermotile in at least one of the types of motility tested. Both mutants that appeared non-motile and hypermotile on plates were assayed for expression levels of FliC and FljB on the bacterial surface and many of them had altered levels of these proteins. The phenotypes we report are the first phenotypes ever assigned to 74 of these open reading frames, as they are annotated as 'hypothetical genes' in the Typhimurium genome.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Bogomolnaya LM","Aldrich L","Ragoza Y","Talamantes M","Andrews KD","McClelland M","Andrews-Polymenis HL"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0111513","first_seen_on":"2015-01-20T13:39:25+00:00","funders":["niaid"],"issns":[""],"issue":"11","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1421761041,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25369209"],"pmid":"25369209","pubdate":"2014-11-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Identification of Novel Factors Involved in Modulating Motility of Salmonella enterica Serotype Typhimurium.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-novel-factors-involved-modulating-motility-salmonella-enterica-serotype-typhimurium"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4752347,"mean":5.7096697584773,"rank":2523977,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1582514,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4752347,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":165731,"mean":8.5805037591265,"rank":86383,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":58808,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":165731,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84514,"mean":9.0187940080225,"rank":48302,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":25976,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84514,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1971,"mean":13.297674111675,"rank":1190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":622,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1971,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
