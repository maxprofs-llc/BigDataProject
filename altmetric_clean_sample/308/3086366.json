Moreover, the outcome of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in these patients is poor despite good engraftment. Mice heterozygous for the I\u03baB\u03b1 S32I mutation found in patients exhibited typical features of ED-ID. Strikingly, the mice lacked lymph nodes, Peyer's patches, splenic marginal zones, and follicular dendritic cells and failed to develop contact hypersensitivity (CHS) or form germinal centers (GCs), all features not previously recognized in patients and typical of defective noncanonical NF-\u03baB signaling. Lymphotoxin \u03b2 receptor (LT\u03b2R)-driven induction of chemokines and adhesion molecules mediated by both canonical and noncanonical NF-\u03baB pathways was impaired, and levels of p100 were markedly diminished in the mutant. I\u03baB\u03b1 mutant\u2192Rag2(-\/-), but not WT\u2192I\u03baB\u03b1 mutant, bone marrow chimeras formed proper lymphoid organs and developed CHS and GCs. Defective architectural cell function explains the immunodeficiency and poor outcome of HSCT in patients with I\u03baB\u03b1 deficiency and suggests that correction of this niche is critical for reconstituting their immune function.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c77","authors":["Jana L Mooster","Severine Le Bras","Michel J Massaad","Haifa Jabara","Juhan Yoon","Claire Galand","Balthasar A Heesters","Oliver T Burton","Hamid Mattoo","John Manis","Raif S Geha"],"doi":"10.1084\/jem.20140979","first_seen_on":"2015-01-21T12:42:35+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid"],"issns":["1540-9538"],"journal":"The Journal of Experimental Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1429912091,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25601653?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25601653","pubdate":"2015-01-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["medicine","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Defective lymphoid organogenesis underlies the immune deficiency caused by a heterozygous S32I mutation in I\u03baB\u03b1","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/defective-lymphoid-organogenesis-underlies-immune-deficiency-caused-heterozygous-s32i-mutation-i-b"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5033243,"mean":5.9592028612997,"rank":2320132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2585650,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5033243,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177209,"mean":8.5268058101216,"rank":75663,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":95880,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177209,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2834,"mean":4.781097776209,"rank":1539,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":1243,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2834,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":8.86025,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":3,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Neuroscience":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":5,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2,"Unspecified":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1},"mendeley":{"KR":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Immunol_papers\/status\/557873266896175108","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3086366],"posted_on":"2015-01-21T12:12:06+00:00","author":{"name":"ImmunologyPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507527250015576065\/AHPc4B-C_normal.png","description":"A TwitterBot for #Immunology papers on #PubMed searching for adaptive, innate and cyto\/chemokine.
