Determining physiological substrates and biochemical functions for the PAFAH1b complex would benefit from selective chemical probes that can perturb its activity in living systems. Here, we report a class of tetrahydropyridine reversible inhibitors of PAFAH1b2\/3 discovered using a fluorescence polarization-activity-based protein profiling (fluopol-ABPP) screen of the NIH 300\u202f000+ compound library. The most potent of these agents, P11, exhibited IC50 values of \u223c40 and 900 nM for PAFAH1b2 and 1b3, respectively. We confirm selective inhibition of PAFAH1b2\/3 in cancer cells by P11 using an ABPP protocol adapted for in situ analysis of reversible inhibitors and show that this compound impairs tumor cell survival, supporting a role for PAFAH1b2\/3 in cancer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006811","authors":["Jae Won Chang","Chang JW","Zuhl AM","Speers AE","Niessen S","Brown SJ","Mulvihill MM","Fan YC","Spicer TP","Southern M","Scampavia L","Fernandez-Vega V","Dix MM","Cameron MD","Hodder PS","Rosen H","Nomura DK","Kwon O","Hsu KL","Cravatt BF"],"doi":"10.1021\/cb500893q","endpage":"932","first_seen_on":"2015-01-20T21:30:59+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms","nci"],"issns":["1554-8929","1554-8937"],"issue":"4","journal":"ACS Chemical Biology","last_mentioned_on":1425629569,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/cb500893q","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/cb500893q"],"pmid":"25602368","pubdate":"2015-01-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"925","subjects":["biology","biochemistry"],"title":"Selective Inhibitor of Platelet-Activating Factor Acetylhydrolases 1b2 and 1b3 That Impairs Cancer Cell Survival.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/selective-inhibitor-plateletactivating-factor-acetylhydrolases-1b2-1b3-impairs-cancer-cell-survival"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4840099,"mean":5.7736249319777,"rank":3234338,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1413278,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4840099,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169807,"mean":8.5074923147594,"rank":109323,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":52746,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169807,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1128,"mean":3.9867506654836,"rank":736,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":332,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1128,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84,"mean":3.3070120481928,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
