The implant was specifically designed to allow bone augmentation. The deficient bone was simultaneously grafted with mineralized bone allograft and recombinant bone morphogenetic protein -2 (rhBMP-2). The 32-month postoperative cone beam computerized tomography follow-up showed vertical bone augmentation beneath the implant frame.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f76","authors":["Cosimo Loperfido"],"doi":"10.1563\/aaid-joi-d-12-00132","first_seen_on":"2015-01-20T19:16:29+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Journal of Oral Implantology","last_mentioned_on":1423302306,"links":["http:\/\/www.joionline.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1563\/AAID-JOI-D-12-00132","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23574428?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"23574428","pubdate":"2013-04-12T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry","generalsurgery"],"title":"Severe Mandibular Atrophy Treated with a Subperiosteal Implant and Simultaneous Graft with rhBMP-2 and Mineralized Allograft: a Case Report.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/severe-mandibular-atrophy-treated-subperiosteal-implant-simultaneous-graft-rhbmp2-mineralized-allogr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4724476,"mean":5.6951346649109,"rank":2347041,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2235046,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4724476,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163017,"mean":8.6313651298035,"rank":76539,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":78910,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163017,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178,"mean":1.6796610169492,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":125,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":0.81071428571429,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
