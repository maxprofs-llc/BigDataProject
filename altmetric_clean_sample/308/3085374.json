Blood was collected using a syringe with a cannula inserted into a superficial arm vein with samples collected at rest, after each 7min stage and 5 and 15min into recovery. With training, all groups observed shifted plasma Peptide F responses to graded exercise, where significant increases were observed at lower exercise intensities. Increases in plasma epinephrine with exercise were observed in all groups. The Combined group saw increases at 25% at T-3 and for 50% at T-2, T-3, and T-4 which was higher than T-1. The Endurance group demonstrated increases for 50% at T-1, T-2, T-3 but not at T-4. The plasma epinephrine response to graded exercise was reduced in the Strength group. Increases in plasma norepinephrine above rest were observed starting at 50% VO2 peak. The Strength group demonstrated a significant reduction in norepinephrine observed at 100% at T-3 and T-4. Peptide F and catecholamines responses to graded exercise can be altered by different types of physical exercise training. Simultaneous high intensity training may produce adrenal medulla exhaustion when compared to single mode training.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032be","authors":["Kraemer WJ","Gordon SE","Fragala MS","Bush JA","Szivak TK","Flanagan SD","Hooper DR","Looney DP","Triplett NT","DuPont WH","Dziados JE","Marchitelli LJ","Patton JF"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.peptides.2015.01.001","first_seen_on":"2015-01-21T08:49:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0196-9781"],"issue":"","journal":"Peptides","last_mentioned_on":1422389906,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25582563"],"pmid":"25582563","pubdate":"2015-01-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"The effects of exercise training programs on plasma concentrations of proenkephalin Peptide F and catecholamines.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-exercise-training-programs-plasma-concentrations-proenkephalin-peptide-f-catecholamines"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7715252,"mean":6.6181111883379,"rank":1783832,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":5911986,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7715252,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235903,"mean":7.9709885037006,"rank":61874,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":173122,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235903,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":700,"mean":2.4882660944206,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":632,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":700,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.8026315789474,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
