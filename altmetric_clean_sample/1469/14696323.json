The monopathogenic theory explains intra-epidermal blistering through the \"desmoglein (Dsg) compensation\" hypothesis, according to which an antibody-dependent disabling of Dsg 1- and\/or Dsg 3-mediated cell-cell attachments of keratinocytes (KCs) is sufficient to disrupt epidermal integrity and cause blistering. The multipathogenic theory explains intra-epidermal blistering through the \"multiple hit\" hypothesis stating that a simultaneous and synchronized inactivation of the physiological mechanisms regulating and\/or mediating intercellular adhesion of KCs is necessary to disrupt epidermal integrity. The major premise for a multipathogenic theory is that a single type of autoantibody induces only reversible changes, so that affected KCs can recover due to a self-repair. The damage, however, becomes irreversible when the salvage pathway and\/or other cell functions are altered by a partnering autoantibody and\/or other pathogenic factors. Future studies are needed to (i) corroborate these findings, (ii) characterize in detail patient populations with non-Dsg-specific autoantibodies, and (iii) determine the extent of the contribution of non-Dsg antibodies in disease pathophysiology.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002891","authors":["Ahmed, A.
