Systematic structural and experimental evidence identified a cationic species, supported by a THF molecule, as the best Lewis acid precatalyst for a range of Diels-Alder cycloadditions. This highlighted the importance of fully isolating and characterizing the active species in any catalytic process especially when Lewis acids are used due to the presence of hidden Br\u00f8nsted acids (HBAs). Finally, the control experiments conducted in order to eliminate HBA activity that involve a bulky pyridine base should be performed with caution as the corresponding protonated pyridinium salt could also serve as a proton source.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Dragoslav Vidovic","Zhizhou Liu","Rakesh Ganguly","Dragoslav Vidovi\u00c4\u0087"],"doi":"10.1039\/c6dt04213a","first_seen_on":"2016-12-13T12:38:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1477-9234"],"journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1482157204,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2016\/DT\/C6DT04213A?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=inorganicnews","http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2017\/DT\/C6DT04213A?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=inorganicnews"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2016\/dt\/c6dt04213a","pmid":"27991617","pubdate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Pursuing the active species in an aluminium-based Lewis acid system for catalytic Diels-Alder cycloadditions","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlelanding\/2017\/dt\/c6dt04213a","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pursuing-active-species-aluminiumbased-lewis-acid-system-catalytic-dielsalder-cycloadditions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7909849,"mean":6.6937446400934,"rank":6848504,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7909849,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252961,"mean":12.34752272296,"rank":206127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252961,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11013,"mean":0.68845059934617,"rank":3104,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11013,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":398,"mean":0.63060453400504,"rank":121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":398,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":3}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/InorganicNews\/statuses\/808652350264995841","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[14697012],"posted_on":"2016-12-13T12:38:38+00:00","author":{"name":"Inorganic News","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1636129253\/DSC01061_2_normal.JPG","description":"News, comments and publications about Inorganic Chemistry.","id_on_source":"InorganicNews","tweeter_id":"411132501","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1288},"tweet_id":"808652350264995841"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/InorganicNews\/statuses\/810852201828532225","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[14697012],"posted_on":"2016-12-19T14:20:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Inorganic News","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1636129253\/DSC01061_2_normal.JPG","description":"News, comments and publications about Inorganic Chemistry.","id_on_source":"InorganicNews","tweeter_id":"411132501","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1288},"tweet_id":"810852201828532225"}]}}
