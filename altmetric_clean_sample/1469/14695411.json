In total, 30 molecules, including flavanone and flavone analogues, were evaluated by reporter gene assays for the PPAR-\u03b3 agonist activity. Preliminary structure-activity relationships of PPAR-\u03b3 agonist activity of bavachinin analogues were initially summarized and analogues 2b, 3, 4a, 4b, 11c, 11d, and 12b were found with higher PPAR-\u03b3 agonist activities compared to bavachinin.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e5f","authors":["Du, Guoxin","Zhao, Yuanyuan","Feng, Li","Yang, Zhuo","Shi, Jiye","Huang, Cheng","Li, Bo","Guo, Fujiang","Zhu, Weiliang","Li, Yiming"],"doi":"10.1002\/cmdc.201600554","first_seen_on":"2016-12-13T11:21:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1860-7187"],"journal":"ChemMedChem","last_mentioned_on":1481628096,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cmdc.201600554\/abstract;jsessionid=60C816604869B756868300ABC403E360.f01t01?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+on+Saturday+17th+December+2016+at+09%3A00+GMT%2F+04%3A00+EST%2F+17%3A00+SGT+for+4hrs+due+to+essential+maintenance.Apologies+for+the+inconvenience"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cmdc.201600554\/pdf","pmid":"27914122","pubdate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry","pharmacology"],"title":"Design, Synthesis, and Structure-Activity Relationships of Bavachinin Analogues as Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor\u2005\u03b3 Agonists","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/design-synthesis-structureactivity-relationships-bavachinin-analogues-peroxisome-proliferatoractivat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7881477,"mean":6.674276674566,"rank":5977201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1056721,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7881477,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251240,"mean":12.35661239696,"rank":176010,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":46523,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251240,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1259,"mean":2.4038473767886,"rank":771,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":202,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1259,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":1.6925757575758,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ChemMedChem\/statuses\/808632960639467520","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[14695411],"posted_on":"2016-12-13T11:21:36+00:00","author":{"name":"ChemMedChem","url":"http:\/\/chemmedchem.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/671669464182751237\/qvZKsaL2_normal.jpg","description":"ChemMedChem is a high-impact journal from @chempubsoc_euro for research at the interface of chemistry, biology, and medicine.","id_on_source":"ChemMedChem","tweeter_id":"1725410090","geo":{"lt":49.54887,"ln":8.66697,"country":"DE"},"followers":1387},"tweet_id":"808632960639467520"}]}}
