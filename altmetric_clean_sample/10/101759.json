We retrospectively examined the brains of aged rhesus monkeys reared during early life in either small cages or larger, \"standard-sized\" cages; all monkeys were subsequently maintained in standard-sized cages during adulthood. Aged monkeys reared in smaller cages exhibited significantly greater \u03b2-amyloid plaque deposition in the neocortex and a significant reduction in synaptophysin immunolabeling in cortical regions compared to aged monkeys reared in standard-sized cages (p<0.001 and p<0.05, respectively). These findings suggest that early environment may influence brain structure and vulnerability to neurodegenerative changes in late life.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f61000318e","authors":["David A Merrill","Eliezer Masliah","Jeffery A Roberts","Heather McKay","Jeffery H Kordower","Elliott J Mufson","Mark H Tuszynski"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neurobiolaging.2009.01.014","issns":["1558-1497"],"issue":"1","journal":"Neurobiology of Aging","last_mentioned_on":1296518400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19321231"],"pmid":"19321231","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology","geriatrics","neurology"],"title":"Association of early experience with neurodegeneration in aged primates.","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-early-experience-neurodegeneration-aged-primates"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.024,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.024},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":436595,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":4602033,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4032287,"mean":6.7344575821254,"rank":400016,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":3632205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4032287,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1430,"mean":5.9467011896431,"rank":197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":1233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1430,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1257,"mean":6.4407643312102,"rank":194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":1063,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1257,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
