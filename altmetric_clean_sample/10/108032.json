In animals, several Antennapedia (ANTP)-class homeobox genes reside in extremely ancient gene clusters (for example, the Hox, ParaHox, and NKL clusters) and the evolution of these clusters has been implicated in the morphological diversification of animal bodyplans. By contrast, similarly ancient gene clusters have not been reported among the other classes of homeobox genes (that is, the LIM, POU, PRD and SIX classes).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000818","authors":["Maureen E Mazza","Kevin Pang","Adam M Reitzel","Mark Q Martindale","John R Finnerty","Mazza ME","Pang K","Reitzel AM","Martindale MQ","Finnerty JR"],"doi":"10.1186\/2041-9139-1-3","issns":["2041-9139",""],"issue":"1","journal":"EvoDevo","last_mentioned_on":1302298380,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20849646"],"pmcid":"PMC2938728","pmid":"20849646","pubdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"}],"title":"A conserved cluster of three PRD-class homeobox genes (homeobrain, rx and orthopedia) in the Cnidaria and Protostomia.","type":"article","volume":"1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/conserved-cluster-three-prdclass-homeobox-genes-homeobrain-rx-orthopedia-cnidaria-protostomia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.088,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.088},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5377214,"mean":6.2848497963553,"rank":481440,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":4895687,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5377214,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4407111,"mean":7.0684015910668,"rank":449560,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":3957423,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4407111,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156,"mean":7.3957677419355,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":129,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":154,"mean":7.407477124183,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":154,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
