This bias is commonly attributed to X inactivation in spermatogenesis but a recent paper in BMC Biology provides evidence against X inactivation in Drosophila and proposes that somatic tissue- and testis- but not ovary-specific genes tend not to be located on the X chromosome. Here, we discuss possible mechanisms underlying this bias, including sexual antagonism and dosage compensation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007aa","authors":["Xuemei Lu","Xuemei Lu","Chung-I Wu"],"doi":"10.1186\/1741-7007-9-30","issns":["","1741-7007"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Biology","last_mentioned_on":1305228240,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1741-7007\/9\/30"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1741-7007-9-30.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3087707","pmid":"21542945","pubdate":"2011-05-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"30","subjects":["biology"],"title":"Sex, sex chromosomes and gene expression","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sex-sex-chromosomes-gene-expression"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.16,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.16},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685110,"mean":4.9372923047901,"rank":214794,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":3470297,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685110,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2769284,"mean":5.2812125535764,"rank":178034,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":2591231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2769284,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":579,"mean":10.776266435986,"rank":126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":453,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":579,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":551,"mean":11.04304,"rank":125,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":426,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":551,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
