Contribution of Masculine Face Shape to Male Attractiveness in Humans","Carotenoids (aka carrots) most important factor regarding average male facial attractiveness due to health signaling","Masculinity may contribute less to men's attractiveness than previously assumed."],"citation":{"abstract":"In many animals, exaggerated sex-typical male traits are preferred by females, and may be a signal of both past and current disease resistance. The proposal that the same is true in humans--i.e., that masculine men are immunocompetent and attractive--underpins a large literature on facial masculinity preferences. Recently, theoretical models have suggested that current condition may be a better index of mate value than past immunocompetence. This is particularly likely in populations where pathogenic fluctuation is fast relative to host life history. As life history is slow in humans, there is reason to expect that, among humans, condition-dependent traits might contribute more to attractiveness than relatively stable traits such as masculinity. To date, however, there has been little rigorous assessment of whether, in the presence of variation in other cues, masculinity predicts attractiveness or not.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2010PLoSO...513585S","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Isabel M.
