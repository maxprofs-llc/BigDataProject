The ICU-based surveillance intervention had little impact after one year with surveillance compliance at 67%. However, once compliance improved, surveillance was expanded to the entire hospital and decolonization was implemented, MRSA BSIs were significantly reduced. Our experience parallels that of the European countries and other United States facilities that have implemented aggressive MRSA control measures. All successful programs have included active surveillance testing and barrier precautions. Finally, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's just-released report on invasive MRSA, since most MRSA infections are associated with health care contact, strategies to prevent and control MRSA among inpatients still may have a positive impact on infection, as demonstrated by our intervention.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f6100059df","authors":["Lance R Peterson","Donna M Hacek","Ari Robicsek","Lance R.
