Although this idea has been present for some time, i.e., insulin crystals were first reported back in 1920s, macromolecular crystallization has not received as much attention as the other methods for stabilizing protein drug candidates. The prospective potential of crystalline protein formulations in light of new advances in the field of macromolecular crystallization was reviewed, and the basic concepts and the tools now available for developing protein crystals into drug formulations are introduced. In addition, formulation challenges and regulatory demands, along with examples of current applications of protein crystals, are presented.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032da","authors":["A Jen","H P Merkle"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0724-8741"],"issue":"11","journal":"Pharmaceutical Research","last_mentioned_on":1294732800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11758753"],"pmid":"11758753","pubdate":"2001-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Diamonds in the rough: protein crystals from a formulation perspective.","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diamonds-rough-protein-crystals-formulation-perspective"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.04,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.04},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685046,"mean":4.9228975163162,"rank":601947,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":3081810,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685046,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2769262,"mean":5.2647415884621,"rank":496661,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":2271442,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2769262,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":396,"mean":3.4400101265823,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":349,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":396,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":359,"mean":3.5496201117318,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":313,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":359,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
