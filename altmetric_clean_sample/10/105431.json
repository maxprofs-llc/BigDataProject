First: With which North African populations do the pre-conquest inhabitants of the Canary Islands have their greatest affinities? Second: Does inter-island biological variability among the Canary Islanders, as has been suggested by other researchers (Hooton 1925, Schwidetzky 1963), imply that potentially different founding populations remained distinct during the pre-conquest period? This study employs dental morphology data derived from pre-conquest skeletons to answer these questions. Non-metric dental traits appear to be controlled by polygenic systems with a low to moderate environmental contribution to the resulting phenotype (Berry 1978, Harris & Bailit 1980, Nichol 1990) and can thus be assumed to reflect genetic relationships. The dental morphology of a sample of Canary Islanders (n = 397) is compared to that of Northwest African samples of Algerian Shawia Berbers (n = 26), Kabyle Berbers (n = 32), Bedouin Arabs (n = 49) and Punic Carthaginians (n = 28) as well as to six samples from Northeast Africa (n = 307) included for the purpose of understanding Canary Islanders' affinities within a wider context. The analysis employs 28 dental traits, quantifying differences in their expression among the various samples through a summary statistic, CAB Smith's Mean Measure of Divergence (MMD). The MMD analysis indicates that the Canary Island sample is most similar to the four samples from Northwest Africa: the Shawia Berbers, Kabyle Berbers, Bedouin Arabs and Carthaginians, less similar to the three Egyptian samples and least like the three Nubian samples. An intra-island comparison among samples from La Gomera, Gran Canaria and Tenerife reveals low, insignificant MMD values in all cases, implying that inter-island dental morphology differences are not so great as to require hypotheses of separate founding populations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029f9","authors":["D Guatelli-Steinberg","J D Irish","J R Lukacs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0018-442X"],"issue":"2","journal":"HOMO - Journal of Comparative Human Biology","last_mentioned_on":1299132120,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11802567"],"pmid":"11802567","pubdate":"2001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Canary islands-north African population affinities: measures of divergence based on dental morphology.","type":"article","volume":"52","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/canary-islandsnorth-african-population-affinities-measures-divergence-based-dental-morphology"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.704,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.704},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685758,"mean":4.9523304688866,"rank":528355,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":3156775,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685758,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2770737,"mean":5.298592576126,"rank":435568,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":2334550,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2770737,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78,"mean":5.3435844155844,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":61,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":6.1191428571429,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
