Genotype data are converted into appropriate formats for a number of common linkage programs and subjected to standard quality control routines before linkage runs are started. ALOHOMORA is written in Perl and may be used to perform state-of-the-art linkage scans in small and large families with any genetic model. Options for using different genetic maps or ethnicity-specific allele frequencies are implemented. Graphic outputs of whole-genome multipoint LOD score values are provided for the entire dataset as well as for individual families.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023d2","authors":["F.
