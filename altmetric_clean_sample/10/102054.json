"],"citation":{"abstract":"We present a microfluidic artificial photosynthetic platform that incorporates quantum dots and redox enzymes for photoenzymatic synthesis of fine chemicals under visible light. Similar to natural photosynthesis, photochemical cofactor regeneration takes place in the light-dependent reaction zone, which is then coupled with the light-independent, enzymatic synthesis in the downstream of the microchannel.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037ac","authors":["Joon Seok Lee","Sahng Ha Lee","Jae Hong Kim","Chan Beum Park"],"doi":"10.1039\/c1lc20303g","issns":["1473-0189","1473-0197"],"issue":"14","journal":"Lab on a Chip - Miniaturisation for Chemistry & Biology","last_mentioned_on":1307621160,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2011\/LC\/C1LC20303G?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed:%20rss\/LC%20(RSC%20-%20Lab%20Chip%20latest%20articles)"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2011\/lc\/c1lc20303g","pmid":"21655630","pubdate":"2011-06-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"2309","subjects":["chemistry","biotechnology"],"title":"Artificial photosynthesis on a chip: microfluidic cofactor regeneration and photoenzymatic synthesis under visible light","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/artificial-photosynthesis-chip-microfluidic-cofactor-regeneration-photoenzymatic-synthesis-under-vis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4729490,"mean":5.5013917665933,"rank":2445565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1658621,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4729490,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3623658,"mean":6.2427852467253,"rank":1946809,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1182937,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3623658,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1744,"mean":3.8524589787722,"rank":731,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":858,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1744,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1229,"mean":4.5871628664495,"rank":555,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":541,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1229,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":[]},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Ph.
