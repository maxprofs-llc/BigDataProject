We study this model on numerous long cylinders with circumferences up to 12 lattice spacings. Through a combination of very-low-energy and small finite-size effects, our results provide strong evidence that, for the infinite two-dimensional system, the ground state of this model is a fully gapped spin liquid.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2011Sci...332.1173Y","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","arxiv_id":"1011.6114","authors":["Simeng Yan","David A.
