To evaluate risk factors, we gathered information on 238 (94%) of those hospitalized and 46 (78%) of those killed. Those hospitalized or deceased had statistically significantly more deep cuts, concussions, unconsciousness and broken bones than those with them at the time of the tornado who were not hospitalized or killed. People living in mobile homes were more likely to be hospitalized or die than people occupying conventional houses. Other risk factors for hospitalization or death included advanced age (60+ years), no physical protection (not having been covered with a blanket or other object), having been struck by broken window glass or other falling objects, home lifted off its foundation, collapsed ceiling or floor, or walls blown away. More awareness of the tornado risk before it strikes and better adherence to tornado protection guidelines could reduce injuries and deaths in the future.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b49","authors":["M Eidson","J A Lybarger","J E Parsons","J N MacCormack","J I Freeman"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0300-5771"],"issue":"4","journal":"International Journal of Epidemiology","last_mentioned_on":1306212660,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2083989"],"pmid":"2083989","pubdate":"1990-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Statistics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["epidemiology"],"title":"Risk factors for tornado injuries.","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/risk-factors-tornado-injuries"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.168,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.168},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685110,"mean":4.9372923047901,"rank":498638,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":3186045,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685110,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2769276,"mean":5.2802951877317,"rank":410733,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":2358121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2769276,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1299,"mean":7.1353281972265,"rank":307,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":992,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1299,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1013,"mean":7.5400513833992,"rank":264,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":749,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1013,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
