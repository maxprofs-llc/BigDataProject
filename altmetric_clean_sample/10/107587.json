Advantages and disadvantages of methods are presented and discussed. Composting, compaction and pyrolysis are the pretreatment steps, since significant amount of contaminated biomass will still exist after each of the process. Four methods of final disposal were distinguished: incineration, direct disposal, ashing and liquid extraction. Among them, incineration (smelting) is proposed as the most feasible, economically acceptable and environmentally sound.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f610006534","authors":["A Sas-Nowosielska"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.envpol.2003.09.012","endpage":"379","issns":["02697491"],"issue":"3","journal":"Environmental Pollution","last_mentioned_on":1247601120,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VB5-4B4RSBM-2&_user=906544&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_searchStrId=937517926&_rerunOrigin=google&_acct=C000047747&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=906544&md5=8095f0c98e2d71e0f7217d10d6d58d93"],"pmid":"14720479","pubdate":"2004-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"373","subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Phytoextraction crop disposal\u2014an unsolved problem","type":"article","volume":"128","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phytoextraction-crop-disposal-unsolved-problem"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.168,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.168},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685758,"mean":4.9469155541215,"rank":581304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":3102847,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685758,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2769683,"mean":5.2941721230109,"rank":479257,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":2288875,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2769683,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":579,"mean":5.9799411764706,"rank":97,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":482,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":579,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":435,"mean":5.1510138248848,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":371,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":435,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
