Yet we do little to assess the value of research projects for future policy, even amid the ubiquitous assertions that 'more research is necessary' on a given topic. This methodological proposal outlines the arguments for why and how ex ante assessments can inform us about the value of a particular piece of further research on a topic.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b49","authors":["C V Phillips"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0300-5771"],"issue":"4","journal":"International Journal of Epidemiology","last_mentioned_on":1370836834,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11511601"],"pmid":"11511601","pubdate":"2001-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Statistics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["epidemiology"],"title":"The economics of 'more research is needed'.","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/choosing-strategies-change-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.626,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.626},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685758,"mean":4.9469155541215,"rank":535083,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":3150662,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685758,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2769679,"mean":5.2938327242391,"rank":440775,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":2328893,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2769679,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1299,"mean":7.1464221879815,"rank":328,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":971,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1299,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1013,"mean":7.5480968379447,"rank":282,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":731,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1013,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
