To investigate the association of XMRV with CFS we tested blood specimens from 51 persons with CFS and 56 healthy persons from the US for evidence of XMRV infection by using serologic and molecular assays. Blinded PCR and serologic testing were performed at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and at two additional laboratories.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000893","authors":["William M Switzer","Hongwei Jia","Oliver Hohn","HaoQiang Zheng","Shaohua Tang","Anupama Shankar","Norbert Bannert","Graham Simmons","R Michael Hendry","Virginia R Falkenberg","William C Reeves","Walid Heneine","Switzer WM","Jia H","Hohn O","Zheng H","Tang S","Shankar A","Bannert N","Simmons G","Hendry RM","Falkenberg VR","Reeves WC","Heneine W"],"doi":"10.1186\/1742-4690-7-57","issns":["1742-4690",""],"issue":"1","journal":"Retrovirology","last_mentioned_on":1422077175,"links":["http:\/\/www.retrovirology.com\/content\/7\/1\/57","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1742-4690-7-57","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2908559","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20594299"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.retrovirology.com\/content\/pdf\/1742-4690-7-57.pdf","pmcid":"PMC2908559","pmid":"20594299","pubdate":"2010-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"57","title":"Absence of evidence of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus infection in persons with chronic fatigue syndrome and healthy controls in the United States.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/retrovirology.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1742-4690-7-57","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/absence-evidence-xenotropic-murine-leukemia-virusrelated-virus-infection-persons-chronic-fatigue-syn-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":84.944,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":84.944},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8034622,"mean":6.8161992312983,"rank":95827,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":7939203,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8034622,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7398497,"mean":7.1419933026904,"rank":94469,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":7304027,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7398497,"percentile":98},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":394,"mean":6.3354452926209,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":389,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":394,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":392,"mean":6.1627519181586,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":388,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":392,"percentile":98}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
