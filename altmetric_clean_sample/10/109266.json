Effective vaccines against most tick-borne pathogens are not currently available. In this study, we characterized a tick histamine release factor (tHRF) from Ixodes scapularis and addressed the vaccine potential of this antigen in the context of tick engorgement and B. burgdorferi transmission. Results from western blotting and quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR showed that tHRF is secreted in tick saliva, and upregulated in Borrelia burgdorferi-infected ticks. Further, the expression of tHRF was coincident with the rapid feeding phase of the tick, suggesting a role for tHRF in tick engorgement and concomitantly, for efficient B. burgdorferi transmission. Silencing tHRF by RNA interference (RNAi) significantly impaired tick feeding and decreased B. burgdorferi burden in mice. Interfering with tHRF by actively immunizing mice with recombinant tHRF, or passively transferring tHRF antiserum, also markedly reduced the efficiency of tick feeding and B. burgdorferi burden in mice. Recombinant tHRF was able to bind to host basophils and stimulate histamine release. Therefore, we speculate that tHRF might function in vivo to modulate vascular permeability and increase blood flow to the tick bite-site, facilitating tick engorgement. These findings suggest that blocking tHRF might offer a viable strategy to complement ongoing efforts to develop vaccines to block tick feeding and transmission of tick-borne pathogens.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000334c","authors":["Jianfeng Dai","Sukanya Narasimhan","Lili Zhang","Lei Liu","Penghua Wang","Erol Fikrig","Jenifer Coburn","Dai J","Narasimhan S","Zhang L","Liu L","Wang P","Fikrig E"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.ppat.1001205","issns":["1553-7374","1553-7366"],"issue":"11","journal":"PLoS Pathogens","last_mentioned_on":1455082200,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.ppat.1001205","http:\/\/www.plospathogens.org\/article\/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1001205","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plospathogens\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.ppat.1001205"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plospathogens\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.ppat.1001205.PDF","pmcid":"PMC2991271","pmid":"21124826","pubdate":"2010-11-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e1001205","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Tick Histamine Release Factor Is Critical for Ixodes scapularis Engorgement and Transmission of the Lyme Disease Agent","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.ppat.1001205","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tick-histamine-release-factor-critical-ixodes-scapularis-engorgement-transmission-lyme-disease-agent"},"altmetric_score":{"score":14.852,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":14.852},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8006495,"mean":6.7591272059856,"rank":535269,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7471380,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8006495,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7370726,"mean":7.0804515919355,"rank":520696,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":6850026,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7370726,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4779,"mean":13.186150690666,"rank":905,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":3874,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4779,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4731,"mean":13.272666384778,"rank":900,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":3831,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4731,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Ph.
