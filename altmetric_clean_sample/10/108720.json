In this paper, we consider the proposal in light of its ability to meet criteria for clinical utility as proposed by First and colleagues (2004). While the Work Group's proposal has addressed some of these concerns, we conclude that there remain several unanswered problems with how the proposal will improve the clinical utility of personality disorders section of the DSM-5. Though these concerns can be addressed to some extent in the field trials, it is incumbent upon the Work Group and clinical researchers to attend carefully to these issues so that shortcomings of previous diagnostic manuals are not repeated in the future.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002eb4","authors":["John F Clarkin","Steven K Huprich","Clarkin JF","Huprich SK"],"doi":"10.1521\/pedi.2011.25.2.192","issns":["1943-2763","0885-579X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Personality Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1302366960,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21466249","http:\/\/www.atypon-link.com\/GPI\/doi\/pdf\/10.1521\/pedi.2011.25.2.192"],"pmid":"21466249","pubdate":"2011-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry","psychology"],"title":"Do DSM-5 personality disorder proposals meet criteria for clinical utility?","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dsm5-personality-disorder-proposals-meet-criteria-clinical-utility"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.032,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.032},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685110,"mean":4.9372923047901,"rank":603321,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":3080450,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685110,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2769284,"mean":5.2828419060116,"rank":497843,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":2270305,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2769284,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":288,"mean":1.7856236933798,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":288,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":286,"mean":1.7881543859649,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":286,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
