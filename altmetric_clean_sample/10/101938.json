In many common AFM experiments the cantilever is mounted parallel to the sample surface, while in our system the cantilever is assembled perpendicular to it; the so called pendulum mode of AFM operation. In this mode measurements employing very soft and, therefore, ultrasensitive cantilevers can be performed. The ultrahigh vacuum conditions allow to prepare and transfer cantilevers and samples in a requested manner avoiding surface contamination. We demonstrate the possibility of nc-AFM and Kelvin force probe microscopy imaging in the pendulum mode. Ultrasensitive experiments on small spin ensembles are presented as well.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"1993JAP....74.6365K","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002c9b","authors":["Hideki Koyama","Nobuyoshi Koshida"],"doi":"10.1063\/1.355160","issns":["00218979","1089-7550"],"issue":"10","journal":"Journal of Applied Physics","last_mentioned_on":1220743860,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1063\/1.355160"],"pmid":"21361599","pubdate":"1993-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"6365","title":"Photo\u2010assisted tuning of luminescence from porous silicon","type":"article","volume":"74","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/photoassisted-tuning-luminescence-porous-silicon"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.008,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.008},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685988,"mean":4.9540738657005,"rank":611565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":3071506,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685988,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2770786,"mean":5.2985430641515,"rank":505195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":2263318,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2770786,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2147,"mean":2.4938359739049,"rank":148,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":1995,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2147,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1881,"mean":2.6308808510638,"rank":143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":1734,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1881,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
