They represent the first cause of death worldwide and in Latin America. Nuclear cardiology has a well-established role in the management of patient with CVDs and is being increasingly integrated into the healthcare systems in the region. However, there remains variability as to the infrastructure available across the countries, in terms of existing technology, radiopharmaceuticals, and human resources. The approximate number of gamma (\u03b3) cameras in the region is 1348, with an average of 2.25 per million population; Argentina and Brazil having the largest number. Nearly 80% of the existing cameras are single-photon emission tomography (SPECT), of which 8% are hybrid SPECT-CT systems. Positron emission tomography technology is steadily increasing, and currently, there is an average of 0.25 scanners per million inhabitants, indicating that there is a potential to expand the capacities in order to cover the needs. Four countries have nuclear reactors for research purposes, which allow the production of technetium-99\u00a0m (Argentina, Chile, Mexico and Peru), while four (Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, and Mexico) assemble (99)Mo-(99m)Tc generators. As for the nuclear cardiology studies, about 80% of studies performed are gated SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging; less than 10% are multi-gated acquisition (mainly for evaluation of cardiac toxicity in cancer patients), and the other 10% correspond to other types of studies, such as viability detection, and adrenergic innervation studies with (123)I-MIBG. Physical stress is preferred, when possible, based on the clinical condition of the patient. Regarding human resources, there is an average of 1.1 physicians and 1.3 technologists per \u03b3 camera, with 0.1 medical physicists and 0.1 radiopharmacists per center in the region. The future of nuclear cardiology in Latin America and the Caribbean is encouraging, with great potential and possibilities for growth. National, regional, and international cooperation including support from scientific societies and organizations such as International Atomic Energy Agency, American Society of Nuclear Cardiology, and Latin American Association of Biology and Nuclear Medicine Societies, as well as governmental commitment are key factors for the development of the specialty. A multimodality approach in cardiac imaging will contribute to a better management of patients with CVDs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007da1","authors":["Paez, Diana","Peix, Amalia","Orellana, Pilar","Vitola, Joao","Mut, Fernando","Guti\u00e9rrez, Claudia","Plaza, Crosby","Becic, Tarik","Dondi, Maurizio","Estrada, Enrique",", "],"doi":"10.1007\/s12350-016-0650-9","first_seen_on":"2016-08-31T15:34:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-6551","1071-3581"],"journal":"Journal of Nuclear Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1472659693,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27572926?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27572926","pubdate":"2016-08-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Imaging \/ Radiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nuclear Medicine","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Current status of nuclear cardiology practice in Latin America and the Caribbean","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/current-status-nuclear-cardiology-practice-latin-america-caribbean-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8307635,"mean":7.0030489970953,"rank":6303666,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1124334,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8307635,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251639,"mean":12.507573522281,"rank":178538,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":40376,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251639,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":793,"mean":3.275404040404,"rank":527,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":793,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":18.379245283019,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":3}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"CO":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cardiacimaging\/statuses\/771003397554184193","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10933445],"posted_on":"2016-08-31T15:15:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Cardiac","url":"http:\/\/j.gs\/1GEa","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2406742261\/x3ds44aipz7rb9caz5p1_normal.jpeg","description":"Cardiovascular imaging and heart health.","id_on_source":"cardiacimaging","tweeter_id":"64524440","geo":{"lt":36.17497,"ln":-115.13722,"country":"US"},"followers":7858},"tweet_id":"771003397554184193"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cardioactual16\/statuses\/771016754659295233","license":"gnip","rt":["cardiacimaging"],"citation_ids":[10933445],"posted_on":"2016-08-31T16:08:13+00:00","author":{"name":"CARDIOACTUAL","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/831279735380533249\/OfXrdG01_normal.jpg","description":"Promover la actualizaci\u00f3n contin\u00faa del \u00e1rea cardiovascular","id_on_source":"cardioactual16","tweeter_id":"4628678657","geo":{"lt":4,"ln":-72,"country":"CO"},"followers":128},"tweet_id":"771016754659295233"}]}}
