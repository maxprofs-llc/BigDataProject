In our focus groups, we identified 3 major domains: (a) global perspectives associated with race and racial dialogue, (b) specific reactions to racial disclosures, and (c) classroom strategies or conditions that proved helpful and unhelpful in facilitating dialogues. Participants appeared to have difficulty understanding how and why difficult dialogues on race occur. In addition, preexisting attitudes\/beliefs\/feelings seemed to serve as major barriers to discussing race honestly and openly. They reported powerful feelings of anxiety, helplessness, and fear of being misunderstood that evoked defensive maneuvers to avoid race topics. Implications for education and training are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ff3cf058f610006171","authors":["Sue DW","Rivera DP","Capodilupo CM","Lin AI","Torino GC"],"doi":"10.1037\/a0016112","first_seen_on":"2014-01-27T02:21:16+00:00","issns":["1099-9809"],"issue":"2","journal":"Cultural Diversity & Ethnic Minority Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1390789202,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20438159"],"pmid":"20438159","pubdate":"2010-05-06T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["socialsciences","psychology"],"title":"Racial dialogues and White trainee fears: Implications for education and training.","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/racial-dialogues-white-trainee-fears-implications-education-training"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3622349,"mean":4.9310300946799,"rank":2904678,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":72512,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3622349,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108132,"mean":6.9831411713571,"rank":84862,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":267,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108132,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":2.43,"rank":77,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":17,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
