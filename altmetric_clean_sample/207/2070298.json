Conclusion:\u00a0 An unusual case of a non-head and neck primary basal cell carcinoma metastatic to the lung was discovered on surveillance PET\/CT imaging, in a patient with oculocutaneous albinism.","abstract_source":"pubmed","authors":["Mickaila Johnston","Whitney Winham","Nicole Massoll","Jerad M.
