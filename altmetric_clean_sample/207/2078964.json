Only a few intervention studies have been reported where childhood constipation has been treated by increasing dietary fibre. The present study aimed to demonstrate that dietary fibre intakes of children with constipation can be increased using a specifically-designed behaviour modification technique with a self-monitoring and reward system.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002de6","authors":["Sullivan PB","Alder N","Shrestha B","Turton L","Lambert B"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1365-277x.2011.01179.x","first_seen_on":"2014-01-28T11:20:34+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Journal of Human Nutrition & Dietetics","last_mentioned_on":1390908025,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21668531"],"pmid":"21668531","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Effectiveness of using a behavioural intervention to improve dietary fibre intakes in children with constipation.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effectiveness-using-behavioural-intervention-improve-dietary-fibre-intakes-children-constipation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4658403,"mean":5.6517182385756,"rank":3295831,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":760740,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4658403,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124968,"mean":7.9871405250987,"rank":83237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":23713,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124968,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":506,"mean":5.6500198019802,"rank":402,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":506,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":9.0636363636364,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
