Previous investigations, including ours, showed that HBV genotypes B and C were respectively predominant in South and North China, while genotypes A and D were infrequently detected and genotype G was not found. In this study, a novel A\/C\/G intergenotype was identified in patients with chronic HBV infection in Guilin, a city in southern China. Initial phylogenetic analysis based on the S gene suggested the HBV recombinant to be genotype G. However, extended genotyping based on the entire HBV genome indicated it to be an A\/C\/G intergenotype with a closer relation to genotype C. Breakpoint analysis using the SIMPLOT program revealed that the recombinant had a recombination with a arrangement of genotypes A, G, A and C fragments. Compared with the HBV recombinants harboring one or two genotype G fragments found in Asian countries, this Guilin recombinant was highly similar to the Vietnam (98-99%) and Long An recombinants (96-99%), but had a relatively low similarity to the Thailand one (89%). Unlike those with the typical genotype G of HBV, the patients with the Guilin recombinant were seropositive for HBeAg. Moreover, a relatively high HBV DNA viral load (>2 \u00d7 10(6) IU\/ml) was detected in the patients, and the analysis of viral replication capacity showed that the Guilin recombinant strains had a competent replication capacity similar to genotypes B and C strains. These findings can aid in not only the clarification of the phylogenetic origin of the HBV recombinants with the genotype G fragment found in Asian countries, but also the understanding of the virological properties of these complicated HBV recombinants.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Heling Su","Yan Liu","Zhihui Xu","Shuquan Cheng","Haiyan Ye","Qing Xu","Qingbo Liu","Shuhong Tan","Dongping Xu","Yongming Liu"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0084005","first_seen_on":"2014-01-26T03:43:03+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"1","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1390707777,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0084005"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0084005.pdf","pmid":"24475029","pubdate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e84005","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"A Novel Complex A\/C\/G Intergenotypic Recombinant of Hepatitis B Virus Isolated in Southern China","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-complex-acg-intergenotypic-recombinant-hepatitis-b-virus-isolated-southern-china"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3554920,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":136712,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121526,"mean":7.7468506727013,"rank":94354,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":804,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121526,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80037,"mean":8.3320977809987,"rank":64258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":632,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80037,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7874,"mean":8.4624819001651,"rank":6076,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7874,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
