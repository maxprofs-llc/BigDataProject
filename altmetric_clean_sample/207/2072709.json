In this work, it has been developed a metabolomic multi-platform for the characterization of phospholipid alterations occurring in serum from Alzheimer's disease patients. For this purpose, we performed a metabolomic screening by direct infusion mass spectrometry and profiling analysis by reversed phase ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with complementary detection by molecular and atomic mass spectrometry, which allowed combining the high-throughput capability of shotgun metabolomics and the targeted character of profiling approaches. Thus significant changes were detected in the levels of several molecular species of phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, plasmenylcholines, plasmenylethanolamines and different classes of lysophospholipids, which provided a global vision of the possible factors triggering membrane breakdown. In this sense, alterations of phospholipids metabolism appears to have a multifactorial origin involving overactivation of phospholipases, increased anabolism of lysophospholipids, peroxisomal dysfunction, imbalances in the levels of saturated\/unsaturated fatty acids contained in the structure of phospholipids and oxidative stress.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ee4","doi":"10.1016\/j.jprot.2014.01.014","first_seen_on":"2014-01-25T16:35:22+00:00","issns":["18743919"],"journal":"Journal of Proteomics","last_mentioned_on":1401394993,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1874391914000268"],"pmid":"24473279","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Combination of metabolomic and phospholipids-profiling approaches for the study of alzheimer\u2019s disease","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/combination-metabolomic-phospholipidprofiling-approaches-study-alzheimers-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3821406,"mean":5.0296322999739,"rank":3064569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":71262,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3821406,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113370,"mean":7.452458485124,"rank":89031,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":227,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113370,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":946,"mean":1.7784042328042,"rank":469,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":946,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.6,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
