Like many other microbial toxins, the protein changes in a multistep process from a completely water-soluble form to produce a transmembrane channel that destroys sensitive cells by breaking their permeability barriers. Here we describe the structure of proaerolysin determined by X-ray crystallography at 2.8 A resolution. The protoxin (M(r) 52,000) adopts a novel protein fold. Images of an aerolysin oligomer derived from electron microscopy have assisted in constructing a model of the membrane channel and have led to the proposal of a scheme to account for insertion of the protein into lipid bilayers to form ion channels.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"1994Natur.367..292P","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003160","authors":["M W Parker","J T Buckley","J P Postma","A D Tucker","K Leonard","F Pattus","D Tsernoglou","Parker, M W","Buckley, J T","Postma, J P","Tucker, A D","Leonard, K","Pattus, F","Tsernoglou, D","Michael W.
