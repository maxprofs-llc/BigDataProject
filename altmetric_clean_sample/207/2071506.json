Thus, a reliable method for monitoring the progression of liver fibrosis and resultant LC is urgently needed. Previously, using a lectin-assisted glycoproteomic method, we identified 26 serum glycoproteins as promising glycobiomarker candidates for monitoring the progression of liver diseases. In this study, we identified colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) as a promising LC marker candidate and then established Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA)-reactive CSF1R (WFA(+)-CSF1R) as a novel possible glycobiomarker candidate by utilizing a glycoproteomics-based strategy. The serum level of WFA(+)-CSF1R in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected liver disease was measured by an antibody-lectin sandwich ELISA. In a proof-of-concept experiment of the strategy preceding to future clinical studies, LC patients showed a high serum WFA(+)-CSF1R level in selected samples (P = 1.3 \u00d7 10(-17)). This result suggests WFA(+)-CSF1R is a possible biomarker candidate for evaluation of LC. Our results verified feasibility of this strategy for glycobiomarker development.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e0f","authors":["Makoto Ocho"],"doi":"10.1021\/pr400986t","first_seen_on":"2014-01-25T02:22:55+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Journal of Proteome Research","last_mentioned_on":1390616569,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/pr400986t"],"pmid":"24422531","pubdate":"2014-01-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Application of a Glycoproteomics-Based Biomarker Development Method: Alteration in Glycan Structure on Colony Stimulating Factor 1 Receptor as a Possible Glycobiomarker Candidate for Evaluation of Liver Cirrhosis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/application-glycoproteomicsbased-biomarker-development-method-alteration-glycan-structure-colony-sti"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505692,"mean":5.1008244577038,"rank":3124023,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1019005,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505692,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121871,"mean":7.6675924181506,"rank":83208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":28775,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121871,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2098,"mean":2.5419132093467,"rank":1495,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2098,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":135,"mean":2.1523731343284,"rank":112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":135,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
