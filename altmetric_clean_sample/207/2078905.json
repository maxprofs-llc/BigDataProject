Since the development of CVD is often a lifelong process, marine n-3 PUFA intake early in life may also affect the development of later CVD. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between maternal intake of marine n-3 PUFA during the second trimester of pregnancy and factors associated with cardiometabolic risk in the 20-year-old offspring. The study was based on the follow-up of the offspring of a Danish pregnancy cohort who participated in a study conducted from 1988 to 1989. A total of 965 pregnant women were originally included in the cohort and detailed information about the intake of marine n-3 PUFA during the second trimester was collected. In 2008-9, the offspring were invited to participate in a clinical examination including anthropometric, blood pressure (BP) and short-term heart rate variability measurements. Also, a fasting venous blood sample was drawn from them. Multiple linear regression modelling, using the lowest quintile of marine n-3 PUFA intake as the reference, was used to estimate the association with all outcomes. A total of 443 offspring participated in the clinical examination. No association between the intake of marine n-3 PUFA during the second trimester of pregnancy and offspring adiposity, glucose metabolism, BP or lipid profile was found. In conclusion, no association between the intake of marine n-3 PUFA during the second trimester of pregnancy and the factors associated with cardiometabolic risk in the 20-year-old offspring could be detected.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000579a","authors":["Rytter D","Bech BH","Halldorsson T","Christensen JH","Schmidt EB","Danielsen I","Henriksen TB","Olsen SF"],"doi":"10.1017\/s0007114513001335","first_seen_on":"2014-01-28T11:10:42+00:00","issns":["0007-1145"],"issue":"","journal":"British Journal of Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1390907422,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23680230?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23680230","pubdate":"2013-05-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"No association between the intake of marine n-3 PUFA during the second trimester of pregnancy and factors associated with cardiometabolic risk in the 20-year-old offspring.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-between-intake-marine-n3-pufa-during-second-trimester-pregnancy-factors-associated-cardi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629179,"mean":4.9362043867828,"rank":2901613,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":77638,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629179,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109804,"mean":6.9867684125209,"rank":85824,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":417,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109804,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1869,"mean":6.268443254818,"rank":1521,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1869,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":2.5447826086957,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
