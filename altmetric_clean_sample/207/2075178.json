People who have taken drugs containing \u03b1-PVP or other synthetic cathinone reportedly lose consciousness, develop difficulty breathing, and at worst case, die. However, the mechanism underlying \u03b1-PVP-induced neurotoxicity is unknown. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of \u03b1-PVP on the central nervous system (CNS) and compare its neurotoxicity with that of methamphetamine (METH) in mice. Balb\/c male mice (8 weeks old) were orally administered \u03b1-PVP (25 mg\/kg) or METH (5 mg\/kg). \u03b1-PVP induced a significant increase in locomotor activity, which occurred earlier than locomotor activity induced by METH. This increase was inhibited by the D1 receptor antagonist SCH23990 (50 \u00b5g\/kg, i.p.) and the D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride (50 mg\/kg, i.m.). The extracellular concentration of dopamine (DA) in the striatum, determined by in vivo microdialysis increased immediately after \u03b1-PVP administration. These results suggest that \u03b1-PVP stimulates DA release, causing an increase in locomotor activity, and that this stimulatory effect of \u03b1-PVP on CNS is mediated, at least in part, by the D1 and D2 receptors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52d3cf058f610004121","authors":["Kaizaki A","Tanaka S","Numazawa S"],"first_seen_on":"2014-01-27T05:26:21+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Toxicological Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1413324066,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24418703","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/24418703\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24418703?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=anxietynews"],"pmid":"24418703","pubdate":"2014-01-16T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"title":"New recreational drug 1-phenyl-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-pentanone (alpha-PVP) activates central nervous system via dopaminergic neuron.","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-recreational-drug-1phenyl21pyrrolidinyl1pentanone-alphapvp-activates-central-nervous-system-via"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6575068,"mean":6.0979883703087,"rank":2924396,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3474260,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6575068,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":158628,"mean":7.7700517440286,"rank":72275,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":81028,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":158628,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":165,"mean":2.5503780487805,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":89,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":165,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":9.1409090909091,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
