Several years ago, even experts in the research fields of redox biology and cell adhesion likely would have answered this question innocuously or evasively. Is there really little to talk about? Some of the former hypotheses on redox biology of cell adhesion have substantialized in the meantime. This Forum provides insights into the interplay between oxygen radical species and the cellular contacts with the extracellular matrix, including the subsequent steps, such as cytoskeleton rearrangement. Moreover, it describes evidences that the cell-matrix contact influences the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby underlying the potential liaison between redox biology and cell adhesion.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022ba","authors":["Eble JA"],"doi":"10.1089\/ars.2014.5857","first_seen_on":"2014-01-28T10:32:16+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Antioxidants & Redox Signaling","last_mentioned_on":1412442189,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24450994?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1089\/ars.2014.5857"],"pmid":"24450994","pubdate":"2014-01-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism"],"title":"Redox biology and cell-matrix interactions: An auspicious link-up!","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/redox-biology-cellmatrix-interactions-auspicious-linkup"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505692,"mean":5.1008244577038,"rank":3000098,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1381655,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505692,"percentile":30},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122633,"mean":7.6196011644597,"rank":80966,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":38771,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122633,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":587,"mean":2.3625051194539,"rank":365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":587,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":1.33,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
