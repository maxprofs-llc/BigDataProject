Drawing on women's testimony and on scientific research, it establishes that this \"treatment,\" which is overwhelmingly given to women, results in extensive cognitive and physical impairment. Correspondingly, it functions and is experienced as a form of assault and social control, not unlike wife battery. Emergent themes include electroshock as life destroying, a sign of contempt for women, punishment, a means of enforcing sex roles, a way to silence women about other abuse, an assault, traumatizing for those who undergo it and those forced to witness it.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4db3cf058f6100017f8","authors":["Bonnie Burstow"],"doi":"10.1177\/1077801206286404","endpage":"392","first_seen_on":"2014-01-28T01:44:14+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1552-8448","1077-8012"],"issue":"4","journal":"Violence Against Women","last_mentioned_on":1427806800,"links":["http:\/\/vaw.sagepub.com\/content\/12\/4\/372.full.pdf","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16567337"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/vaw.sagepub.com\/content\/12\/4\/372.full.pdf","pmid":"16567337","pubdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Studies In Human Society","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Law And Legal Studies","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences"],"startpage":"372","title":"Electroshock as a form of violence against women.","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/electroshock-form-violence-against-women"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.328,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.328},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4941811,"mean":5.8614681928312,"rank":452241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":4489544,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4941811,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":134692,"mean":7.9109254961357,"rank":15678,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":119013,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":134692,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":452,"mean":4.4993614190687,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":409,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":452,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":7.7174,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
