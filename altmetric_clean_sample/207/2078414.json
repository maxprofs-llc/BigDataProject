Here we found that IRF1 was essential for IL-1-induced expression of the chemokines CXCL10 and CCL5, which recruit mononuclear cells into sites of sterile inflammation. Newly synthesized IRF1 acquired Lys63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitination mediated by the apoptosis inhibitor cIAP2 that was enhanced by the bioactive lipid S1P. In response to IL-1, cIAP2 and the sphingosine kinase SphK1 (the enzyme that generates S1P) formed a complex with IRF1, which led to its activation. Thus, IL-1 triggered a hitherto unknown signaling cascade that controlled the induction of IRF1-dependent genes that encode molecules important for sterile inflammation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003165","authors":["Kuzhuvelil B Harikumar","Jessie W Yester","Michael J Surace","Clement Oyeniran","Megan M Price","Wei-Ching Huang","Nitai C Hait","Jeremy C Allegood","Akimitsu Yamada","Xiangqian Kong","Helen M Lazear","Reetika Bhardwaj","Kazuaki Takabe","Michael S Diamond","Cheng Luo","Sheldon Milstien","Sarah Spiegel","Tomasz Kordula","Harikumar KB","Yester JW","Surace MJ","Oyeniran C","Price MM","Huang WC","Hait NC","Allegood JC","Yamada A","Kong X","Lazear HM","Bhardwaj R","Takabe K","Diamond MS","Luo C","Milstien S","Spiegel S","Kordula T"],"doi":"10.1038\/ni.2810","endpage":"238","first_seen_on":"2014-01-28T07:22:07+00:00","funders":["nci","niaid","nigms"],"issns":["1529-2908","1529-2916"],"issue":"3","journal":"Nature Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1391825665,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ni\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/abs\/ni.2810.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ni\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/ni.2810.html","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/ni.2810","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24464131"],"pmid":"24464131","pubdate":"2014-01-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemokines","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"231","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"K63-linked polyubiquitination of transcription factor IRF1 is essential for IL-1-induced production of chemokines CXCL10 and CCL5","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/k63linked-polyubiquitination-transcription-factor-irf1-essential-il1induced-production-chemokines-cx"},"altmetric_score":{"score":55,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505915,"mean":5.1093654012801,"rank":58838,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":4447021,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505915,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122638,"mean":7.6370822671789,"rank":3220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":119407,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122638,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1712,"mean":5.5319731151373,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":1684,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1712,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":11.27158974359,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":24,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
