Current regulatory requirements were compiled and compared. The scope of the team's discussions included the validation report, the bioanalytical report, study plans, raw data, and bioanalytical summaries for the common technical document (CTD). A common high-level table of contents for method validation and sample analysis reports is proposed. Suggestions have been made as to how the CTD can be standardized to improve usability and review. Additional comments have been made on reports of failure investigations, study plans, and raw data documentation. The recommendation is that no prescriptive guidelines are required in these areas but should be led by good scientific practices subject to particular circumstances.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067ec","authors":["Tom Verhaeghe","Hollie H.
