Despite of the needs and growing investigation, little is known about the impact of low doses and mixtures of these chemicals on human health. The purpose of this study was to enlighten if modifications of liver cell metabolic- and\/or defence-related capacities could occur under such exposures. In vitro perturbations of several metabolic, stress and survival pathways in human and mice cultured hepatocytes and liver cells were evaluated under exposure to low doses of single molecules or equimolecular combinations of the three pesticides, atrazine, chlorpyrifos and endosulfan. Mainly phases I and II enzymes of detoxification were found modulated, together with apoptotic process deregulation. Hence, CYP3A4 and CYP3A11 were upregulated in primary cultured human and mouse hepatocytes, respectively. These inductions were correlated to an anti-apoptotic process (increased Bcl-xL\/Bax ratio, inhibition of the PARP protein cleavage). Such disturbances in pathways involved in cell protection may possibly account for initiation of pathologies or decrease in drugs efficiency in humans exposed to multiple environmental contaminants.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f61000367c","authors":["Rouimi P","Zucchini-Pascal N","Dupont G","Razpotnik A","Fouch\u00e9 E","De Sousa G","Rahmani R"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.tiv.2012.03.015","first_seen_on":"2014-01-25T15:37:01+00:00","issns":["0887-2333"],"journal":"Toxicology in Vitro","last_mentioned_on":1390601774,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.tiv.2012.03.015","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22515965"],"pmid":"22515965","pubdate":"2012-04-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"title":"Impacts of low doses of pesticide mixtures on liver cell defence systems.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impacts-low-doses-pesticide-mixtures-liver-cell-defence-systems"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628651,"mean":4.9397870194191,"rank":288853,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":3326619,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628651,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109245,"mean":7.0620689282709,"rank":11248,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":97717,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109245,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":216,"mean":3.2818976744186,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":216,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.8125,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
