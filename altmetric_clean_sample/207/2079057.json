In this study, we showed that the expression of a fusion protein, consisting of a Ca\u00b2\u207a indicator protein (G-CaMP6) and a cytoskeleton protein (actin), enabled large-scale recording of Ca\u00b2\u207a dynamics from hundreds of postsynaptic spines and presynaptic boutons in a cortical pyramidal cell. At dendritic spines, G-CaMP6-actin had the potential to detect localized Ca\u00b2\u207a activity triggered by subthreshold synaptic inputs. Back-propagating action potentials reliably induced Ca\u00b2\u207a fluorescent increases in all spines. At axonal boutons, G-CaMP6-actin reported action potential trains propagating along axonal collaterals. The detectability of G-CaMP6-actin should contribute toward a deeper understanding of neural network architecture and dynamics at the level of individual synapses.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f6100082af","doi":"10.1097\/wnr.0000000000000126","first_seen_on":"2014-01-28T11:44:15+00:00","issns":["0959-4965"],"issue":"","journal":"NeuroReport","last_mentioned_on":1390909445,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/neuroreport\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Large_scale_imaging_of_subcellular_calcium.99124.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/neuroreport\/9000\/00000\/Large_scale_imaging_of_subcellular_calcium.99124.pdf","pmid":"24468806","pubdate":"2014-01-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Large-scale imaging of subcellular calcium dynamics of cortical neurons with G-CaMP6-actin","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/largescale-imaging-subcellular-calcium-dynamics-cortical-neurons-gcamp6actin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3062089,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":941473,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122659,"mean":7.6861710936102,"rank":80708,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":27222,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122659,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1282,"mean":2.8892146760343,"rank":718,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":197,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1282,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":1.273,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
