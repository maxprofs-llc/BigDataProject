The analogous dmbpy complex, [Pt(H4tg-S)2(dmbpy)]\u00b7H2O (2a; dmbpy = 4,4'-dimethyl-2,2'-bipyridine), is also emissive in the solid state, but its absorption and emission spectra remain unchanged after dehydration. X-ray crystallographic analyses revealed that the difference in the chromism of 1a and 2a is due to the difference in their hydrogen-bonding networks, which involve solvated water molecules.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Naoki Kitani","Naoto Kuwamura","Takaaki Tsuji","Kiyoshi Tsuge","Takumi Konno"],"doi":"10.1021\/ic402887f","first_seen_on":"2014-01-27T17:59:01+00:00","issns":["0020-1669","1520-510X"],"journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1390937898,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ic402887f"],"pmid":"24467311","pubdate":"2014-01-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"140127083610003","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Water-Molecule-Driven Vapochromic Behavior of a Mononuclear Platinum(II) System with Mixed Bipyridine and Thioglucose","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/watermoleculedriven-vapochromic-behavior-mononuclear-platinumii-system-mixed-bipyridine-thioglucose"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":2310595,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1579855,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121354,"mean":7.728005982547,"rank":58960,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":44228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121354,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5999,"mean":1.4886435478493,"rank":2148,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1995,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5999,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":356,"mean":1.3219718309859,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":99,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":356,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
