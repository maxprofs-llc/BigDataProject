Automation may help to increase precision and decrease operator errors, eventually improving the diagnostic performance. Here we evaluated three new CSF immunoassays, EUROIMMUNtrademark amyloid-\u03b2 1-40 (A\u03b21\u00a0-\u00a040), amyloid-\u03b2 1-42 (A\u03b21\u00a0-\u00a042), and total tau (t-tau), in combination with automated analysis of the samples. The CSF biomarkers were measured in a cohort consisting of AD patients (n\u200a=\u200a28), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n\u200a=\u200a77), and neurological controls (OND, n\u200a=\u200a35). MCI patients were evaluated yearly and cognitive functions were assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination. The patients clinically diagnosed with AD and MCI were classified according to the CSF biomarkers profile following NIA-AA criteria and the Erlangen score. Technical evaluation of the immunoassays was performed together with the calculation of their diagnostic performance. Furthermore, the results for EUROIMMUN A\u03b21\u00a0-\u00a042 and t-tau were compared to standard immunoassay methods (INNOTESTtrademark). EUROIMMUN assays for A\u03b21\u00a0-\u00a042 and t-tau correlated with INNOTEST (r\u200a=\u200a0.83, p\u200a<\u200a0.001 for both) and allowed a similar interpretation of the CSF profiles. The A\u03b21\u00a0-\u00a042\/A\u03b21\u00a0-\u00a040 ratio measured with EUROIMMUN was the best parameter for AD detection and improved the diagnostic accuracy of A\u03b21\u00a0-\u00a042 (area under the curve\u200a=\u200a0.93). In MCI patients, the A\u03b21\u00a0-\u00a042\/A\u03b21\u00a0-\u00a040 ratio was associated with cognitive decline and clinical progression to AD.The diagnostic performance of the EUROIMMUN assays with automation is comparable to other currently used methods. The variability of the method and the value of the A\u03b21\u00a0-\u00a042\/A\u03b21\u00a0-\u00a040 ratio in AD diagnosis need to be validated in large multi-center studies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c7a","authors":["Chiasserini, Davide","Biscetti, Leonardo","Farotti, Lucia","Eusebi, Paolo","Salvadori, Nicola","Lisetti, Viviana","Baschieri, Francesca","Chipi, Elena","Frattini, Giulia","Stoops, Erik","Vanderstichele, Hugo","Calabresi, Paolo","Parnetti, Lucilla"],"doi":"10.3233\/jad-160298","endpage":"13","first_seen_on":"2016-08-01T15:37:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1875-8908","13872877","18758908"],"journal":"Journal of Alzheimer's Disease","last_mentioned_on":1469855745,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27447425"],"pmid":"27447425","pubdate":"2016-07-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["geriatrics","neurology"],"title":"Performance Evaluation of an Automated ELISA System for Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Detection in Clinical Routine","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/performance-evaluation-automated-elisa-system-alzheimers-disease-detection-clinical-routine-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8156965,"mean":6.8933631772734,"rank":1168076,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6914824,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8156965,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257687,"mean":11.989103040134,"rank":52765,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":201736,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257687,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2439,"mean":14.883616899098,"rank":996,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":832,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2439,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187,"mean":16.590795698925,"rank":110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187,"percentile":8}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
