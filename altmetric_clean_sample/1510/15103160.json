Pharmacologically these substances have either a steroidal structure, like cyproterone acetate (CPA) and spironolactone (SPL), or a non-steroidal structure, like flutamide (FLU). In women with hyperandrogenism (PCO syndrome, idiopathic hirsutism, acne), clinical benefit may be obtained with CPA, which also displays a progestational activity and an antigonadotropic effect. CPA (25-50 mg\/day) is used in combination with ethinyl-estradiol (EE) (20-30 micrograms\/day) in reversed sequential regimen. SPL, less effective than CPA may be employed in moderate hirsutism and acne at dosages of 100-200 mg\/day. During SPL treatment menstrual irregularities are frequent: in this case an association with oral contraceptives is indicated. SPL + bromocriptine (2.5-5 mg\/day) has been experienced with success in PCO syndrome. The pure antiandrogen FLU, inducing progressive increase in LH and testosterone secretion, may be used only in combination with oral contraceptives. In men antiandrogens have been tested in BPH and prostatic carcinoma. In BPH the decrease in nuclear receptors and DHT nuclear content during CPA or FLU may represent the rational base of the medical treatment. An improvement in urinary obstructive manifestation has been observed with CPA alone or associated with tamoxifen (100 mg + 100 mg day). In advanced prostatic carcinoma antiandrogens represent a good alternative to estrogen therapy with less side effects and in combination with surgical or medical castration (LH-RH analogues) achieve a complete androgen blockade. An increase in the percentage of remissions and survival has been reported.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f3c","authors":["Sciarra, F","Toscano, V","Concolino, G","Di Silverio, F"],"first_seen_on":"2016-12-27T20:22:46+00:00","issns":["0960-0760"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Steroid Biochemistry & Molecular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1482870161,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2147859"],"pmid":"2147859","pubdate":"1990-11-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Antiandrogens: clinical applications.","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antiandrogens-clinical-applications"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7942916,"mean":6.7127945609325,"rank":1959586,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4892286,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7942916,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252981,"mean":12.493408965135,"rank":86689,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":161632,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252981,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":959,"mean":3.2709457202505,"rank":173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":495,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":959,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":2.1024324324324,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Computer Science":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Antiandrogen","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=756942360#altmetric_citation_24d337f7-38c8-4027-813a-27b127692084","license":"public","citation_ids":[15103160],"posted_on":"2016-12-27T20:22:41+00:00","summary":"Antiandrogens, also known as androgen antagonists or testosterone blockers, are a class of drugs which prevent androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) from mediating their biological effects in the body.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=179978","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Medgirl131","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Medgirl131"}}]}}
