Meanwhile, a new plant breeding technique, genome editing is expected to make genetic engineering-mediated crop breeding more socially acceptable because it can be used to develop crop varieties without introducing transgenes, which have hampered the regulatory review and public acceptance of GM crops. The present study revealed that product- and process-based concepts have been implemented to regulate GM crops in 30 countries. Moreover, this study analyzed the regulatory responses to genome-edited crops in the USA, Argentina, Sweden and New Zealand. The findings suggested that countries will likely be divided in their policies on genome-edited crops: Some will deregulate transgene-free crops, while others will regulate all types of crops that have been modified by genome editing. These implications are discussed from the viewpoint of public acceptance.","altmetric_jid":"554b86622a83ee864e8b4578","authors":["Ishii, Tetsuya","Araki, Motoko","Tetsuya Ishii","Motoko Araki"],"doi":"10.1080\/21645698.2016.1261787","endpage":"00","first_seen_on":"2016-12-28T00:27:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2164-5701","2164-5698"],"journal":"GM Crops & Food","last_mentioned_on":1486768027,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27960622","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/21645698.2016.1261787","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/eprint\/W9gxda7n3T59XsPHvbWH\/full"],"pmid":"27960622","pubdate":"2016-12-14T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"00","subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology","botany"],"title":"A future scenario of the global regulatory landscape regarding genome-edited crops","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/21645698.2016.1261787","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/future-scenario-global-regulatory-landscape-regarding-genomeedited-crops"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":2.6,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8459245,"mean":7.1062594182092,"rank":3433540,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4999473,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8459245,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282394,"mean":12.163848232781,"rank":106890,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":174015,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282394,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106,"mean":9.181980952381,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":4.9375,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
