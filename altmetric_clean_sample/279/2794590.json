Both free and encapsulated urease exhibits a similar pH optimum. The interaction of urease with cellulose sulphate causes a decrease of the activity down to 35 to 38%. In spite of its lower absolute activity the encapsulated urease shows a higher long time stability than the free urease. The presented immobilization method for urease could be of importance for an active detoxification in uremia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9173cf058f61000d0bb","authors":["O Ristau","K Pommerening","C Jung","H Rein","W Scheler"],"first_seen_on":"2014-10-20T14:44:50+00:00","issns":["0232-766X"],"issue":"7-8","journal":"Biomedica biochimica acta","last_mentioned_on":1413816271,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/4084266"],"pmid":"4084266","pubdate":"1985-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["medicine","biology","biochemistry"],"title":"[Activity of urease in microcapsules].","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/activity-urease-microcapsules"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4394709,"mean":4.8436588422563,"rank":3421117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":128374,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4394709,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121326,"mean":7.5612123799712,"rank":91926,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":769,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121326,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.5961538461538,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"[Activity of urease in microcapsules].
