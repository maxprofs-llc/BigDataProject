In an outbred model strain of Long-Evans rats, cognitive performance as a function of age is variable in assessments of hippocampal-dependent spatial memory. Recent research indicates that greater hippocampal neurogenesis accompanies diminished cognitive abilities in older Long-Evans rats. These findings imply that the role of neurogenesis might change between youth and old age, and that further work is needed to understand the potential benefits and liabilities that new neurons may afford an aging brain.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f6100088ba","authors":["Bizon JL","Gallagher M"],"doi":"10.1126\/sageke.2005.7.re2","first_seen_on":"2014-10-19T08:37:32+00:00","issns":[""],"issue":"7","journal":"Science of Aging Knowledge Environment","last_mentioned_on":1412917260,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15716513"],"pmid":"15716513","pubdate":"2005-02-19T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["science"],"title":"More is less: neurogenesis and age-related cognitive decline in Long-Evans rats.","type":"article","volume":"2005","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/more-less-neurogenesis-agerelated-cognitive-decline-longevans-rats-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.12,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.12},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4351319,"mean":4.8921243495113,"rank":694452,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":3656402,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4351319,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119129,"mean":7.7263945671883,"rank":24686,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":94443,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119129,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":3.202,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"The Grids of Nobel (Medial Temporal Lobe-rific)","url":"http:\/\/syntheticdaisies.blogspot.com\/2014\/10\/the-grids-of-nobel-medial-temporal-lobe.html","citation_ids":[2791899,2791900,2791901,146534,1428155,2791902,2791903,2791904,2744608,533264,139621,1361239],"posted_on":"2014-10-10T05:01:00+00:00","summary":"This year's Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine went to John O'Keefe, May-Britt Moser, and Edvard I.
