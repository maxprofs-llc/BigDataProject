These molecules are exposed to mechanical forces, but the exact relation between force and the functions and pathologies associated with cell-surface proteins is unclear. An important cell-surface protein is CD4, the primary receptor of HIV-1. Here we show that mechanical force activates conformational and chemical changes on CD4 that may be important during viral attachment. We have used single-molecule force spectroscopy and analysis on HIV-1 infectivity to demonstrate that the mechanical extension of CD4 occurs in a time-dependent manner and correlates with HIV-1 infectivity. We show that Ibalizumab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks HIV-1, prevents the mechanical extension of CD4 domains 1 and 2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that thiol\/disulfide exchange in CD4 requires force for exposure of cryptic disulfide bonds. This mechanical perspective provides unprecedented information that can change our understanding on how viruses interact with their hosts.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006816","authors":["Raul Perez-Jimenez"],"doi":"10.1021\/nn503557w","first_seen_on":"2014-10-21T23:35:49+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["1936-0851"],"journal":"ACS Nano","last_mentioned_on":1414786450,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/nn503557w"],"pmid":"25299596","pubdate":"2014-10-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Probing the Effect of Force on HIV-1 Receptor CD4.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/probing-effect-force-hiv1-receptor-cd4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":1921221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2543408,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124491,"mean":8.2137454735322,"rank":47743,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":75038,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124491,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3520,"mean":8.698136402387,"rank":1825,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":1662,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3520,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177,"mean":11.031420454545,"rank":79,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":92,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
