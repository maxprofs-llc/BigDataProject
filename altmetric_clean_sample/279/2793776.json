It has recently been shown that the fractalkine system modulates murine \u03b2-cell function. However, the impact of CX3CL1 on human islet cells especially regarding a protective role against cytokine-induced apoptosis remains to be investigated.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"537f30862a83eeb45a8b4630","doi":"10.1016\/j.molmet.2014.07.007","first_seen_on":"2014-10-20T08:43:51+00:00","issns":["22128778","2212-8778"],"journal":"Molecular Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1423442400,"links":["http:\/\/download.journals.elsevierhealth.com\/pdfs\/journals\/2212-8778\/PIIS2212877814001331.pdf","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25353001?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.molmet.2014.07.007"],"pmid":"25353001","title":"Fractalkine (CX3CL1), a new factor protecting \u03b2-cells against TNF\u03b1.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fractalkine-cx3cl1-new-factor-protecting-cells-against-tnf"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8035375,"mean":6.817666982019,"rank":1000780,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7030313,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8035375,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201033,"mean":7.8124171375703,"rank":29856,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":171036,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201033,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":383,"mean":9.7799895287958,"rank":93,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":289,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":383,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":12.754545454545,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
