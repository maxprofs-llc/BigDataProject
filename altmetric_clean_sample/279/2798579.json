Four dimensional (4D) PET\/CT is one approach to overcome this problem. Existing techniques to limiting the effects of respiratory motions are based on prospective phase binning which requires a long acquisition duration (15-25 min). This time is uncomfortable for the patients and limits the clinical exploitation of 4D PET\/CT. In this work, the authors evaluated an existing method and an alternative retrospective binning method to reduce the acquisition duration of 4D PET\/CT.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5023cf058f61000309b","authors":["David Didierlaurent","David Didierlaurent","Cyril Jaudet","Sophie Ribes","Hadj Batatia","Lawrence O.
