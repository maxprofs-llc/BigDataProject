Here, we report a method to efficiently produce endothelial cells from hPSCs via GSK3 inhibition and culture in defined media to direct hPSC differentiation to CD34(+)CD31(+) endothelial progenitors. Exogenous vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment was dispensable, and endothelial progenitor differentiation was \u03b2-catenin dependent. Furthermore, by clonal analysis, we showed that CD34(+)CD31(+)CD117(+)TIE-2(+) endothelial progenitors were multipotent, capable of differentiating into calponin-expressing smooth muscle cells and CD31(+)CD144(+)vWF(+)I-CAM1(+) endothelial cells. These endothelial cells were capable of 20 population doublings, formed tube-like structures, imported acetylated low-density lipoprotein, and maintained a dynamic barrier function. This study provides a rapid and efficient method for production of hPSC-derived endothelial progenitors and endothelial cells and identifies WNT\/\u03b2-catenin signaling as a primary regulator for generating vascular cells from hPSCs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"52d5438d3cf05876028b4567","authors":["Lian X","Bao X","Al-Ahmad A","Liu J","Wu Y","Dong W","Dunn KK","Shusta EV","Palecek SP"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.stemcr.2014.09.005","endpage":"816","first_seen_on":"2014-10-20T21:42:57+00:00","funders":["nigms","nci"],"issns":["2213-6711","","22136711"],"issue":"5","journal":"Stem Cell Reports","last_mentioned_on":1417501072,"links":["http:\/\/www.cell.com\/stem-cell-reports\/abstract\/S2213-6711%2814%2900290-2#.VEVzSi_TdiU.facebook","http:\/\/www.cell.com\/stem-cell-reports\/abstract\/S2213-6711%2814%2900290-2?elsca1=etoc&elsca2=email&elsca3=2213-6711_20141111_3_5_&elsca4=Cell+Press#.VGJ9kSOkdGo.facebook","http:\/\/www.cell.com\/stem-cell-reports\/abstract\/S2213-6711%2814%2900290-2?elsca1=etoc&elsca2=email&elsca3=2213-6711_20141111_3_5_&elsca4=Cell+Press#.VGJ9kVCUci4.facebook","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25418725?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.cell.com\/stem-cell-reports\/abstract\/S2213-6711%2814%2900290-2#.VH1ZQtm9wEo.facebook","http:\/\/www.cell.com\/stem-cell-reports\/abstract\/S2213-6711%2814%2900290-2#.VH1ZQlkeFZ0.facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S2213671114002902\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4235141","pmid":"25418725","pubdate":"2014-11-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","startpage":"804","title":"Efficient Differentiation of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells to Endothelial Progenitors via Small-Molecule Activation of WNT Signaling","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/efficient-differentiation-human-pluripotent-stem-cells-endothelial-progenitors-via-smallmolecule-act-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4575816,"mean":5.3764004311399,"rank":1773127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":2771755,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4575816,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125100,"mean":8.4971839742924,"rank":42703,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":81009,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125100,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":364,"mean":17.344512396694,"rank":232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":125,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":364,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":28.316555555556,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":28,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
