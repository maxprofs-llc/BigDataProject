We obtained a 32.15-Mb genome draft containing 9,254 genes. Genome ontology enrichment and pathway analyses shed light on sexual development and the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenoids, triterpenoids, ergostanes, antroquinonol, and antrocamphin. We identified genes differentially expressed between mycelium and fruiting body and 242 proteins in the mevalonate pathway, terpenoid pathways, cytochrome P450s, and polyketide synthases, which may contribute to the production of medicinal secondary metabolites. Genes of secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways showed expression enrichment for tissue-specific compounds, including 14-\u03b1-demethylase (CYP51F1) in fruiting body for converting lanostane to ergostane triterpenoids, coenzymes Q (COQ) for antroquinonol biosynthesis in mycelium, and polyketide synthase for antrocamphin biosynthesis in fruiting body. Our data will be useful for developing a strategy to increase the production of useful metabolites.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Mei-Yeh Jade Lu","Wen-Lang Fan","Woei-Fuh Wang","Tingchun Chen","Yi-Ching Tang","Fang-Hua Chu","Tun-Tschu Chang","Sheng-Yang Wang","Meng-yun Li","Yi-Hua Chen","Ze-Shiang Lin","Kai-Jung Yang","Shih-May Chen","Yu-Chuan Teng","Yan-Liang Lin","Jei-Fu Shaw","Ting-Fang Wang","Wen-Hsiung Li"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.1417570111","first_seen_on":"2014-10-22T01:10:38+00:00","issns":["1091-6490"],"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1452743052,"links":["http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2014\/10\/21\/1417570111","http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2014\/10\/21\/1417570111.abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.1417570111","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25336756","http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/111\/44\/E4743","http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/111\/44\/E4743.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2014\/10\/21\/1417570111.full.pdf","pmid":"25336756","pubdate":"2014-10-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"201417570","subjects":["science"],"title":"Genomic and transcriptomic analyses of the medicinal fungus Antrodia cinnamomea for its metabolite biosynthesis and sexual development","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genomic-transcriptomic-analyses-medicinal-fungus-antrodia-cinnamomea-metabolite-biosynthesis-sexual"},"altmetric_score":{"score":17.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":17.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6975036,"mean":6.2337487846271,"rank":371819,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":6602246,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6975036,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196260,"mean":7.5247874390476,"rank":13960,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":182255,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196260,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42241,"mean":21.734377935606,"rank":8170,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":34048,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42241,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":940,"mean":44.326272630458,"rank":364,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":575,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":940,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
