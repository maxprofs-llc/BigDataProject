SC2"],"citation":{"abstract":"Nitrogen source and concentration are major determinants of methanotrophic activity, but their effect on global gene expression is poorly studied. Methylocystis sp. strain SC2 produces two isozymes of particulate methane monooxygenase. These are encoded by pmoCAB1 (low-affinity pMMO1) and pmoCAB2 (high-affinity pMMO2). We used RNA-Seq to identify strain SC2 genes that respond to standard (10\u2009mM) and high (30\u2009mM) NH4 (+) concentrations in the medium, compared with 10\u2009mM NO3 (-) . While the expression of pmoCAB1 was unaffected, pmoCAB2 was significantly downregulated (log2 fold changes of -5.0 to -6.0). Among nitrogen metabolism-related processes, genes involved in hydroxylamine detoxification (haoAB) were highly upregulated, while those for assimilatory nitrate\/nitrite reduction, high-affinity ammonium uptake and nitrogen regulatory protein PII were downregulated. Differential expression of pmoCAB2 and haoAB was independently validated by end-point reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Methane oxidation by SC2 cells exposed to 30 mM NH4 (+) was inhibited at \u2264\u2009400\u2009ppmv CH4 , where pMMO2 but not pMMO1 is functional. When transferred back to standard nitrogen concentration, methane oxidation capability and pmoCAB2 expression were restored. Given that Methylocystis contributes to atmospheric methane oxidation in upland soils, differential expression of pmoCAB2 explains, at least to some extent, the strong inhibitory effect of ammonium fertilizers on this activity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027ea","authors":["Dam, Bomba","Dam, Somasri","Kim, Yongkyu","Liesack, Werner"],"doi":"10.1111\/1462-2920.12367","endpage":"3127","first_seen_on":"2014-10-19T17:01:12+00:00","issns":["1462-2920","1462-2912"],"issue":"10","journal":"Environmental Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1413737932,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1462-2920.12367\/abstract?campaign=woletoc"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1462-2920.12367\/pdf","pmid":"24373058","pubdate":"2014-02-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"3115","subjects":["environmentalhealth","microbiology"],"title":"Ammonium induces differential expression of methane and nitrogen metabolism\u2010related genes in Methylocystis sp. strain SC2","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ammonium-induces-differential-expression-methane-nitrogen-metabolismrelated-genes-methylocystis-sp-s"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6340407,"mean":5.9774305285816,"rank":4685325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":943375,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6340407,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":165243,"mean":8.1435451277522,"rank":110648,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":33255,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":165243,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1356,"mean":4.4487793357934,"rank":1061,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1356,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":3.2916666666667,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
