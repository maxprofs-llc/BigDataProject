However, patients with distant metastatic disease experience progression of disease with higher mortality. A subset of patients not previously described may challenge the conventional dogma regarding the progressive nature of all metastatic WDTC. Methods: Through analysis of our database, we identified patients with distant metastatic WDTC and persistent, minimally-progressive disease. In all patients, persistent metastatic disease was confirmed via tissue biopsy, abnormal PET scan and\/or biochemical elevations in thyroglobulin or antibody levels. Progression of disease was monitored clinically and with repeat imaging. Result: We describe 5 patients with WDTC and pulmonary metastases, ages 8 to 43 years old at diagnosis. All patients underwent initial surgery and radioactive iodine (RAI) ablation, with some receiving multiple treatments. Persistent pulmonary metastatic disease was confirmed over decades (mean 22 years, range 8-42 years) with minimal progression despite no further treatment beyond thyroid hormone suppression. Persistent disease was biopsy-proven in all patients at a mean 9.6 years from last RAI treatment. All patients had elevated thyroglobulin or anti-thyroglobulin antibody levels, while three demonstrated metabolically active disease with positive FDG uptake on PET scan, and one patient with persistent radioiodine avid pulmonary metastasis 36 years after her last RAI treatment. Conclusion: This case series demonstrates that some patients with distant metastases, even if metabolically active and radioiodine resistant, remain stable for decades without further treatment. Clinical awareness of such patients and continual reassessment of disease risk following initial therapy is crucial as aggressive treatment may not be necessary.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"548ec0372a83ee48028b4567","authors":["Norra  Kwong","Ellen  Marqusee","Michael S.
