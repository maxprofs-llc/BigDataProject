As a consequence interprofessional continuing education (CIPE) is gathering momentum in German health policy and health care practice aiming to enhance service quality and patient safety. Nevertheless, there is limited evidence on the course of implementation and the perceived effectiveness\/acceptance of CIPE in German health care. This paper describes the objectives and formal characteristics of CIPE trainings and maps important determinants influencing the success of CIPE implementation from the perspective of providers offering CIPE trainings for German health care professionals.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007bf","doi":"10.1186\/1472-6920-14-227","first_seen_on":"2014-10-21T13:51:35+00:00","issns":["1472-6920"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Medical Education","last_mentioned_on":1413915858,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6920\/14\/227\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1472-6920-14-227.pdf","pmid":"25335560","pubdate":"2014-10-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"227","subjects":["education"],"title":"Barriers in the implementation of interprofessional continuing education programs - a qualitative study from Germany","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/barriers-implementation-interprofessional-continuing-education-programsa-qualitative-study-germany"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":2295820,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1617877,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124491,"mean":8.210815519319,"rank":61610,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":48160,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124491,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":792,"mean":4.0439292035398,"rank":532,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":178,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":792,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":2.8896226415094,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
