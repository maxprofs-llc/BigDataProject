The model was developed to be used in conjunction with the SPC CG water model (J. Chem. Phys. 2011, 134, 084110) and the GROMOS force field functional form. Explicit electrostatic interactions are considered by assigning point charges to each CG bead. Validation of the model is presented to a variety of structural and thermodynamic properties for mono- and oligosaccharides in solution. In addition, the model development philosophy allows for prompt extensions to include hexopyranose chains with diverse glycosidic linkages and branches.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bcd","authors":["Victor Holanda Rusu","Riccardo Baron","Roberto D.
