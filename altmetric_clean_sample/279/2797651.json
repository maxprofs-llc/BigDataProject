H. Chen), which showed protection effects against antimycin A induced mitochondrial oxidative stress. Their structures were elucidated by chemical and spectroscopic methods (IR, HRESI-TOF-MS, 1D and 2D NMR). Among them, compounds 4, 6 and 7 showed significant protective effects against antimycin A-induced L6 cell injury.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422e","authors":["Zhang Y","Han LF","Sakah KJ","Wu ZZ","Liu LL","Agyemang K","Gao XM","Wang T"],"doi":"10.3390\/molecules180910352","first_seen_on":"2014-10-21T10:47:50+00:00","issns":[""],"issue":"9","journal":"Molecules","last_mentioned_on":1413888367,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24064450?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24064450","pubdate":"2013-09-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Bioactive protopanaxatriol type saponins isolated from the roots of panax notoginseng (burk.) f.
