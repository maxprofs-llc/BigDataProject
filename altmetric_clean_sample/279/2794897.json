Advancement in providing common interfaces over such tools and services are gaining interest among researchers. However, the lack of (meta-) information about input-output data and parameter prevents to provide automated and standardized solutions, which can assist users in setting the appropriate parameters. These limitations must be resolved especially in the workflow-based solution in order to ease the integration of software.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000798","doi":"10.1186\/1756-0500-7-740","first_seen_on":"2014-10-20T17:04:49+00:00","issns":["1756-0500"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Research Notes","last_mentioned_on":1413835001,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1756-0500\/7\/740\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1756-0500-7-740.pdf","pmid":"25332013","pubdate":"2014-10-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"740","subjects":["medicine","biology"],"title":"BIFI: a Taverna plugin for a simplified and user-friendly workflow platform","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bifi-taverna-plugin-simplified-userfriendly-workflow-platform"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4394709,"mean":4.8436588422563,"rank":1894067,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":2443828,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4394709,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121325,"mean":7.56456963173,"rank":46637,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":72981,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121325,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1328,"mean":3.1671032403919,"rank":428,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":878,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1328,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":130,"mean":2.2566046511628,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":90,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":130,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
