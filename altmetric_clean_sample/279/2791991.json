In Experiment 2, we further assessed the ability of the adolescent chimpanzees to engage in open-ended categorisation of black-and-white line drawings. The current results confirmed and extended previous findings, showing that sub-adult chimpanzees outperform adult chimpanzees in the categorisation of pictorial stimuli, particularly when the stimuli are more degraded and abstract in nature. However, none of the four chimpanzees showed positive transfer of their category learning to a set of black-and-white line drawings, and neither of the adolescent chimpanzees evidenced reliable open-ended categorisation of the black-and-white line drawings. The latter findings suggest that both sub-adult and adult chimpanzees find it difficult to recognise black-and-white line drawings, and that open-ended categorisation of black-and-white line drawings is challenging for chimpanzees.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002259","authors":["James Close","Josep Call","Close J","Call J"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10071-014-0813-5","endpage":"449","first_seen_on":"2014-10-19T10:06:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1435-9456","1435-9448"],"issue":"2","journal":"Animal Cognition","last_mentioned_on":1427288400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25326248?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10071-014-0813-5","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs10071-014-0813-5"],"pmid":"25326248","pubdate":"2014-10-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Behavioural Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Physiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"437","title":"From colour photographs to black-and-white line drawings: an assessment of chimpanzees\u2019 (Pan troglodytes\u2019) transfer behaviour","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/colour-photographs-blackandwhite-line-drawings-assessment-chimpanzees-pan-troglodytes-transfer-behav"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8316637,"mean":7.008121638837,"rank":2022048,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6273753,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8316637,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201199,"mean":7.9097266076206,"rank":52233,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":148247,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201199,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":781,"mean":21.305207692308,"rank":402,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":370,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":781,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":21.63419047619,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
