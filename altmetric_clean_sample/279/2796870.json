The reasons for this failure are several. First, many agents that are called antioxidants are truly antioxidants at a given dose, but this dose may not have been given in clinical trials. Second, many agents are not antioxidants at all. Third, not all tumors use reactive oxygen as a signaling mechanism. Finally, reactive oxygen inhibition is often insufficient to kill or regress a tumor cell by itself, but requires sequential introduction of a therapeutic agent for maximal effect. We hope to provide a framework for the logical use of these agents in cancer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f6100074e0","authors":["Michael Y Bonner","Jack L Arbiser"],"doi":"10.4155\/fmc.14.86","first_seen_on":"2014-10-21T07:03:48+00:00","funders":["niams"],"issns":["1756-8919","1756-8927"],"issue":"12","journal":"Future Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1463388548,"links":["http:\/\/www.future-science.com\/doi\/abs\/10.4155\/fmc.14.86","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4412352\/?utm_content=bufferb2c15&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4412352\/?utm_content=buffer372b2&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmid":"25329197","pubdate":"2014-08-14T23:00:00+00:00","subjects":["chemistry","pharmacy"],"title":"The antioxidant paradox: what are antioxidants and how should they be used in a therapeutic context for cancer.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antioxidant-paradox-antioxidants-used-therapeutic-context-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7705951,"mean":6.6114203323351,"rank":3768374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3740663,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7705951,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":199949,"mean":7.6866708944327,"rank":88602,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":103560,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":199949,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":458,"mean":3.4607571115974,"rank":176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":270,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":458,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":0.8234375,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
