This report describes the kinetics of ZIKV decay in the body compartments and the kinetics of anti ZIKV IgG and IgM of two people returning from Martinique, French West Indies. ZIKV remained detectable in the plasma for roughly 2 weeks indicating that mosquito control measures should be prolonged accordingly. Remarkably, their urine samples consistently tested positive for even longer. The antibodies responses were different between the two patients but for both the rapid onset of IgM allowed a diagnosis from the end of the first week.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d09","authors":["Fourcade, Camille","Mansuy, Jean-Michel","Dutertre, Marine","Delpech, Marie","Marchou, Bruno","Delobel, Pierre","Izopet, Jacques","Martin-Blondel, Guillaume"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jcv.2016.06.011","first_seen_on":"2016-06-22T17:22:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["13866532","1873-5967"],"journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","last_mentioned_on":1466616093,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1386653216301445"],"pmid":"27389909","pubdate":"2016-07-09T22:01:14+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Viral load kinetics of Zika virus in plasma, urine and saliva in a couple returning from Martinique, French West Indies ","type":"article","volume":"82","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/viral-load-kinetics-zika-virus-plasma-urine-saliva-couple-returning-martinique-french-west-indies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7931561,"mean":6.7081498191978,"rank":6865870,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7931561,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262170,"mean":11.566379762672,"rank":219577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262170,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":836,"mean":4.2759113772455,"rank":719,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":836,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":5.31368,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":4,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
