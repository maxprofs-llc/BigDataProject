Many of these disorders are associated with structurally and functionally normal livers, barring a single genetic defect, making them suitable for auxiliary or domino liver transplantation. The resected livers of these patients are normally discarded. Use of these livers for Domino Transplant has never been tested for fear of transmitting the metabolic defect. However, if these livers are used in a Domino transplant, as an auxiliary graft, the native remnant liver of the recipient should provide adequate enzyme activity to prevent clinical manifestation of the transmitted genetic defect. Here we show that grafts from donors with Propionoic Acidemia can be safely used as Domino Auxiliary liver grafts in patients with Criggler Najar Syndrome Type1 without manifestation of either disease. The two hemilivers cancel out each other's genetic deficiencies to prevent clinical manifestation of either disease. This technique helps to extend the donor pool of livers for transplantation in children with liver based monogenic metabolic disorders. This article is protected by copyright.
