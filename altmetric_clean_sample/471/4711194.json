The first attack of BPPV usually occurs in bed or upon getting up. Because it often begins abruptly, it can be alarming and lead to emergency department evaluation. The episodes of spinning often last 10 to 20\u00a0seconds, but may occasionally last as long as 1\u00a0minute. There are several forms of BPPV. In nearly all cases, highly effective treatment can be offered to patients. This article reviews the current state of our understanding of this condition and its management.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005695","authors":["Fife, Terry D","von Brevern, Michael"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ncl.2015.04.003","first_seen_on":"2015-11-01T13:51:32+00:00","issns":["1557-9875","0733-8619"],"issue":"3","journal":"Neurologic clinics","last_mentioned_on":1446304920,"links":["http:\/\/www.neurologic.theclinics.com\/article\/S0733-8619%2815%2900022-5\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.neurologic.theclinics.com\/article\/S0733861915000225\/pdf","pmid":"26231274","pubdate":"2015-01-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo in the Acute Care Setting","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/benign-paroxysmal-positional-vertigo-acute-care-setting-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6510470,"mean":6.0313826788807,"rank":1146598,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":5336554,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6510470,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207614,"mean":10.272121360416,"rank":49866,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":157214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207614,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":199,"mean":3.4240909090909,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":155,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":199,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":4.6964285714286,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
