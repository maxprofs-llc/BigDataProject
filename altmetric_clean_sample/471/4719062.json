In the absence of data showing harm, it is ethically reasonable for parents to request such information, because in other types of medical decision-making, they are often given discretion unless their decisions clearly harm the child. Some parents might not want this information because it could distract them from focusing on the child's underlying condition that prompted sequencing. Collecting family impact data may improve future policy determinations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e1c","authors":["Wilfond, Benjamin S","Fernandez, Conrad V","Green, Robert C"],"doi":"10.1111\/jlme.12298","first_seen_on":"2015-11-03T15:48:47+00:00","funders":["nci","niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1748-720X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics","last_mentioned_on":1446576002,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jlme.12298\/epdf"],"pmid":"26479565","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Law","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Applied Ethics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["medicine","ethics","jurisprudence"],"title":"Disclosing Secondary Findings from Pediatric Sequencing to Families: Considering the \"Benefit to Families\".","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/disclosing-secondary-findings-pediatric-sequencing-families-considering-benefit-families"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6526504,"mean":6.0446498766627,"rank":2690768,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3687421,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6526504,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208914,"mean":10.27321140379,"rank":93655,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":108530,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208914,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":415,"mean":4.9764396135266,"rank":241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":163,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":415,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":4.59375,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
