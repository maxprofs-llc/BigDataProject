Previous experiments indicated that HOX4B protein can specifically activate the expression of the endogenous Dfd transcription unit in Drosophila embryos and larvae. We therefore asked whether HOX4B cis-regulatory elements could mimic the function of a Dfd autoregulatory element in Drosophila embryos. Here we show that a HOX4B upstream element can surprisingly provide expression in a posterior head segment of Drosophila. One possible mechanism for the axial position-specificity of the human element may involve the conservation of a Dfd-specific autoregulatory circuit in both arthropod and chordate lineages. This possibility is supported by the finding that a Drosophila Dfd autoregulatory element supplies spatially localized expression in the hindbrain of mouse embryos.","ads_id":"1992Natur.358..345M","altmetric_jid":"ads","authors":["Jarema Malicki","Luciano C.
