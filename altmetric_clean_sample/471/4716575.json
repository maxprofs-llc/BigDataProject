In our center, we developed a modification of balloon-assisted technique (BAT) for difficult ASDs to assist proper positioning of the device. Our aim was to demonstrate the efficiency of ASD closure with self-centering devices in children and to present the results of the new pediatric version of BAT (PBAT) in young children and its relation to the interatrial septal thickness.\nOver 2 years, a total of 65 patients with ASD secundum were referred for closure, from which 50 cases were deemed suitable for transcatheter closure by transthoracic echocardiography during precatheter evaluation. Ten difficult defects required assisted techniques; 6 of these were successfully closed using the PBAT with a small-sized valvuloplasty balloon. The cut-off levels for needing an assistance technique in pediatric patients were age >5 years, ASD >16 mm, and weight >22 kg. The interatrial septal thickness was thinner in young ASD patients.\nThe PBAT was needed to optimize device closure in difficult cases, especially in large defects without rim deficiency. This technique is easy to learn and results in quick and simple device closure.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cfa","authors":["El Saiedi, Sonia A","Attia, Wael A"],"first_seen_on":"2015-11-03T11:07:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1557-2501"],"issue":"11","journal":"Journal of Invasive Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1446548828,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26524205?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26524205","pubdate":"2015-11-03T22:00:18+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"New Pediatric Version of Balloon-Assisted Technique for Atrial Septal Defect Closure Using Self-Centering Devices: Relation to Interatrial Septal Thickness.","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-pediatric-version-balloonassisted-technique-atrial-septal-defect-closure-using-selfcentering-dev"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6526504,"mean":6.0446498766627,"rank":5567624,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6526504,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208913,"mean":10.273238320441,"rank":166523,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208913,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280,"mean":0.72501792114695,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":0.57727272727273,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CardiologiaF\/statuses\/661499846210138113","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4716575],"posted_on":"2015-11-03T11:07:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Cardiolog\u00eda-Fabumed","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1561758151\/fabumed_normal.png","description":"Cardiolog\u00eda.
