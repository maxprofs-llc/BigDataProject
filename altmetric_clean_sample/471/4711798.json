HT\u2026","Does a Video Improve Knowledge of HIV\/AIDS HIV Testing among a Global Internet Audience?","Does a video improve #HIV #AIDSAwareness and HIV testing among a global #internet audience?"],"citation":{"abstract":"The objectives of this study were to determine if a video improved HIV\/AIDS and HIV testing knowledge among a global sample of Internet users, to discern if this improvement was the same for English and Spanish speakers, and to ascertain if the video was efficacious for those with lower health literacy. A worldwide sample of English- or Spanish-speaking Internet users was solicited. Participants completed a 25-item questionnaire to assess their HIV\/AIDS and HIV testing knowledge before and after watching the video. Mean scores on the questionnaire improved after watching the video for both English speakers (after: 19.6 versus before: 16.4; \u0394 = 3.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.8-3.5) and Spanish speakers (20.7 versus 17.3; \u0394 = 3.4; 95% CI: 3.0-3.8). There was no difference in improvement of scores between English and Spanish speakers (\u0394 = -0.24; 95% CI: -0.79 to 0.31), and this video was equally efficacious for those with lower and higher health literacy skills.","altmetric_jid":"536246122a83ee225b8b457b","authors":["Shao, Winnie","Guan, Wentao","Clark, Melissa A","Liu, Tao","Santelices, Claudia","Cortes, Dharma E","Merchant, Roland C","Winnie Shao","Wentao Guan","Melissa A.
