This difficulty mainly arises from the presence of large (14)N quadrupolar interactions in comparison to the rf field that can practically be achieved. In the present work it is demonstrated that the application of on-resonance (14)N-(1)H decoupling with rf field strength \u223c30 times weaker than the (14)N quadrupolar coupling during (1)H CSA recoupling under ultrafast MAS (90kHz) results in CSA lineshapes that are free from any distortions from recoupled (14)N-(1)H interactions. With the use of extensive numerical simulations we have shown the applicability of our proposed method on a naturally abundant l-Histidine HCl\u00b7H2O sample.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e26","authors":["Pandey, Manoj Kumar","Nishiyama, Yusuke"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jmr.2015.10.015","first_seen_on":"2015-11-01T22:08:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["10907807","1096-0856"],"journal":"Journal of Magnetic Resonance","last_mentioned_on":1446805815,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1090780715002487","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S1090780715002487&_version=1&md5=25fd68fd6b100b9161a33b68ed1e3837"],"pmid":"26580062","pubdate":"2015-11-19T22:00:22+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Determination of NH Proton Chemical Shift Anisotropy with 14N-1H Heteronuclear Decoupling using Ultrafast Magic Angle Spinning Solid-State NMR ","type":"article","volume":"261","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/determination-nh-proton-chemical-shift-anisotropy-14n1h-heteronuclear-decoupling-using-ultrafast-mag"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6535212,"mean":6.0548114281224,"rank":2523493,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3933854,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6535212,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208229,"mean":10.290367846783,"rank":85331,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":119884,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208229,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":486,"mean":1.4377773195876,"rank":91,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":389,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":486,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":1.3966666666667,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
