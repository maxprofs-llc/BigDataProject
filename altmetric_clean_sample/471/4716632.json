The present study aims to address this ongoing problem by investigating whether health behaviours (i.e. smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity) mediate the prospective relation between workplace reciprocity and future sickness absence.\nA cohort of 24,402 Belgian employees was followed up during 12 months for sickness absence. Workplace reciprocity was measured with four indicators-colleague help, colleague interest, supervisor help, and supervisor concern. Three types of multilevel mediation models were applied.\nOverall, workplace reciprocity negatively related to high sickness absence (\u2265 10 days) mainly independently from health behaviours. Uniquely, colleague interest positively related to smoking (OR = 1.058, 95% CI = 1.019, 1.098) and smoking in turn, positively related to sickness absence (OR = 1.074, 95% CI = 1.047, 1.101). No behavioural pathways could be identified between company-level reciprocity and sickness absence, and company-level health-related behaviours did not mediate the relation between company-level reciprocity and individual sickness absence.\nThese results suggest that both social capital and health behaviours are relevant for employee health, but health behaviours seem not to be the underlying explanatory mechanism between workplace reciprocity and health.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Bart De Clercq","Els Clays","Heidi Janssens","Dirk De Bacquer","Annalisa Casini","France Kittel","Lutgart Braeckman","De Clercq, Bart","Clays, Els","Janssens, Heidi","De Bacquer, Dirk","Casini, Annalisa","Kittel, France","Braeckman, Lutgart"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0141608","first_seen_on":"2015-11-03T11:09:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handle":"1854\/LU-6992716","handles":["1854\/LU-6992716"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"11","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1446567270,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0141608","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0141608"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0141608.PDF","pmid":"26524011","pubdate":"2015-11-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0141608","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Health Behaviours As a Mechanism in the Prospective Relation between Workplace Reciprocity and Absenteeism: A Bridge too Far ?","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/health-behaviours-mechanism-prospective-relation-between-workplace-reciprocity-absenteeism-bridge-fa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8077168,"mean":6.8575053438833,"rank":3473466,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4489363,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8077168,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243687,"mean":9.7873917172096,"rank":91351,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":147663,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243687,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112445,"mean":10.559386805877,"rank":47799,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":61861,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112445,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5472,"mean":10.141145677207,"rank":2202,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":3124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5472,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
