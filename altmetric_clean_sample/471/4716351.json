Next generation sequencing (NGS) methodology is suggested as an effective means in genome characterization and detection of transgenic insertion locations. In the present study, we applied NGS to insert transgenic loci, specifically the epidermal growth factor (EGF) in genetically modified rice cells. A total of 29.3 Gb (~72\u00d7 coverage) was sequenced with a 2 \u00d7 150 bp paired end method by Illumina HiSeq2500, which was consecutively mapped to the rice genome and T-vector sequence. The compatible pairs of reads were successfully mapped to 10 loci on the rice chromosome and vector sequences were validated to the insertion location by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. The EGF transgenic site was confirmed only on chromosome 4 by PCR. Results of this study demonstrated the success of NGS data to characterize the rice genome. Bioinformatics analyses must be developed in association with NGS data to identify highly accurate transgenic sites.","authors":["Park, Doori","Kim, Dongin","Jang, Green","Lim, Jongsung","Shin, Yun-Ji","Kim, Jina","Seo, Mi-Seong","Park, Su-Hyun","Kim, Ju-Kon","Kwon, Tae-Ho","Choi, Ik-Young"],"doi":"10.5808\/gi.2015.13.3.81","first_seen_on":"2015-11-03T11:00:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1598-866X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Genomics & informatics","last_mentioned_on":1446548435,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26523132?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26523132","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Efficiency to Discovery Transgenic Loci in GM Rice Using Next Generation Sequencing Whole Genome Re-sequencing.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/efficiency-discovery-transgenic-loci-gm-rice-using-next-generation-sequencing-whole-genome-resequenc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
