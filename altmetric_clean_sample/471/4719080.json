Logistic regression was used to determine the association between preoperative statin use and occurrence of POAF. A propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis was also performed. Patients in the statin group were older, had a higher body mass index, frequency of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, myocardial infarction, and preoperative \u03b2-blocker use. POAF occurred in 35 patients (34.3%) in the statin group and 39 patients (27.5%) in the control group. Univariate analysis demonstrated no association between statin use and the occurrence of POAF (odds ratio [OR] 1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.796-2.39). Multivariable analysis also showed no association between POAF and preoperative statin use (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.566-2.09). Repeating the analysis in 128 PSM patients demonstrated no association (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.507-2.29).\nPreoperative statin use was not associated with a decreased incidence of POAF in patients undergoing isolated cardiac valve surgery. Additional studies are needed to further elucidate the pharmacodynamics of statins in patients undergoing cardiac surgery because statins have demonstrated a decrease in the risk of POAF in other cardiac surgery populations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032e5","authors":["Bolesta, Scott","Kong, Fanhui"],"doi":"10.1002\/phar.1655","endpage":"1006","first_seen_on":"2015-11-03T15:50:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1875-9114","02770008"],"issue":"11","journal":"Pharmacotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1493686072,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/phar.1655\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/phar.1655\/abstract;jsessionid=256882C4D910FA16645D0F8A8D481F11.f02t02"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/phar.1655\/pdf","pmid":"26598092","pubdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"998","subjects":["drugtherapy"],"title":"Effect of Statins on the Incidence of Postoperative Atrial Fibrillation after Cardiac Valve Surgery","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-statins-incidence-postoperative-atrial-fibrillation-after-cardiac-valve-surgery-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0.85,"6m":0.85,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8161363,"mean":6.8964925866473,"rank":4035323,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":4063391,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8161363,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244172,"mean":9.8000386696208,"rank":114114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":127845,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244172,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1195,"mean":4.79891959799,"rank":776,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":404,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1195,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":5.2383333333333,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
