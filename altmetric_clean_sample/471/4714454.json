Adult restaurant goers who were randomly given olive oil for their bread used 26% more oil on each piece of bread compared to those who were given block butter, but they ended up eating 23% less bread in total. This finding illustrates one way in which fat intake can interact with the consumption of companion foods.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b83","authors":["Brian Wansink","Lawrence R Linder","Wansink, Brian","Linder, Lawrence R"],"doi":"10.1038\/sj.ijo.0802291","endpage":"868","first_seen_on":"2015-11-02T17:17:30+00:00","issns":["0307-0565","1476-5497","03070565","14765497"],"issue":"7","journal":"International Journal of Obesity","last_mentioned_on":1466637484,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ijo\/journal\/v27\/n7\/full\/0802291a.html","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/12821975\/?i=10&from=olive%20oil%20butter%20bread"],"pmid":"12821975","pubdate":"2003-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"866","subjects":["metabolism","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Interactions between forms of fat consumption and restaurant bread consumption","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interactions-between-forms-fat-consumption-restaurant-bread-consumption"},"altmetric_score":{"score":19,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":19},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7931561,"mean":6.7081498191978,"rank":412014,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7516473,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7931561,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242208,"mean":9.6853096979029,"rank":19874,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":222268,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242208,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2339,"mean":15.757852865697,"rank":372,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":1965,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2339,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":23.061,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
