The severity of CCh, lifestyle at the time of SCH onset, and the frequency of previous SCHs were compared. Thirty-eight patients with 2 or more episodes of SCHs (mean age, 68.2\u00b18.9 years) underwent surgery for CCh. The effectiveness of surgery was evaluated by comparing the frequency of SCH preoperatively and postoperatively.\nPatients with three or more recurrent SCHs showed a significantly (P=0.003) higher grade of CCh and tended to be engaged in activities that require visual concentration, such as watching a visual display terminal, knitting, reading, and driving. More than 80% of eyes that underwent surgery to CCh showed no recurrence of the hemorrhages, and the frequency of SCH significantly (P<0.0001) decreased postoperatively.\nModerate or severe CCh and activities that may cause dry eye can be considered to be risk factors for recurrent SCHs. Surgery to treat CCh is a useful option for patients with frequent recurrences of SCHs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073e6","authors":["Yamamoto, Yasuaki","Yokoi, Norihiko","Ogata, Miki","Shiraishi, Atsushi","Yamaguchi, Masahiko","Uno, Toshihiko","Inagaki, Kayoko","Hayashi, Kozaburo","Kinoshita, Shigeru","Ohashi, Yuichi"],"doi":"10.1097\/icl.0000000000000139","first_seen_on":"2015-11-03T11:15:11+00:00","issns":["1542-233X","1542-2321"],"issue":"6","journal":"Eye and Contact Lens","last_mentioned_on":1446520707,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/claojournal\/Abstract\/2015\/11000\/Correlation_Between_Recurrent_Subconjunctival.8.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/claojournal\/2015\/11000\/Correlation_Between_Recurrent_Subconjunctival.8.pdf","pmid":"26269933","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"367","subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Correlation Between Recurrent Subconjunctival Hemorrhages and Conjunctivochalasis by Clinical Profile and Successful Surgical Outcome","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/correlation-between-recurrent-subconjunctival-hemorrhages-conjunctivochalasis-clinical-profile-succe"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6526504,"mean":6.0446498766627,"rank":5567604,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6526504,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208913,"mean":10.273265843992,"rank":166519,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208913,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":210,"mean":4.8044593301435,"rank":162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":210,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.1978260869565,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
