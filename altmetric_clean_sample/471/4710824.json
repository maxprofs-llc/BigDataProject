MK-801 (100 \u03bcM), a specific non-competitive antagonist to NMDA-receptor complex, prevented this effect. NMDA (20 \u03bcM), the specific agonist to this complex, produced no significant effect on the orthodromic population spikes, but when applied at concentrations of 30 or 40 \u03bcM, it inhibited them partially (by 21-28%) or almost completely (by 98-99%), correspondingly. Thus, depending on concentration, NMDA can inhibit the synaptic transmission in Schaffer collaterals-hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons axis without triggering the epileptiform activity. D-AP5 (50 \u03bcM), a competitive antagonist to NMDA-receptor complex, completely prevented the inhibitory effect of NMDA (40 \u03bcM). While MK-801 (100 \u03bcM) almost completely prevented the inhibitory effect of NMDA, it did not eliminate it when applied after the agonist. Thus, MK-801 can prevent the inhibitory action of NMDA on synaptic transmission in Schaffer collaterals-hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons axis via blocking the channel of NMDA-receptor complex, while NMDA exerts its effect only via activation of NMDA receptors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000246e","authors":["Motin, V G","Yasnetsov, V V"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10517-015-3053-z","first_seen_on":"2015-11-01T11:13:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-8221"],"journal":"Bulletin of Experimental Biology & Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1446376393,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26519264?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26519264","pubdate":"2015-11-01T22:00:19+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Laboratory Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pathology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","biology"],"title":"Effect of NMDA, a Specific Agonist to NMDA Receptor Complex, on Rat Hippocampus.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-nmda-specific-agonist-nmda-receptor-complex-rat-hippocampus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6516271,"mean":6.0347598107487,"rank":3087419,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1947362,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6516271,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207706,"mean":10.272401068823,"rank":111532,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":75183,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207706,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":433,"mean":1.3106666666667,"rank":128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":433,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":1.1705128205128,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
