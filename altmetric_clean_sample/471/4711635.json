The yeast two-hybrid technique is a widely used, powerful method of analyzing protein-protein interactions. The currently used formats, however, have inherent limitations, providing an opportunity to develop new alternatives that extend our ability to detect protein-protein interactions of biological relevance. Here we present a two-hybrid system named SRYTH (Ste11p\/Ste50p related yeast two-hybrid) based on the Ste11p\/Ste50p interaction that uses the activation of the HOG pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a reporter for interactions. The system is suitable for detecting cytoplasmic protein interactions in their natural subcellular environment, and has been successfully used to investigate protein-protein interactions, including transcription factor associations, in Candida albicans.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd3b","authors":["Mallick, Jaideep","Jansen, Gregor","Wu, Cunle","Whiteway, Malcolm"],"doi":"10.1007\/978-1-4939-3052-4_3","first_seen_on":"2015-11-01T19:29:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1940-6029"],"journal":"Methods in molecular biology","last_mentioned_on":1446406147,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26519063?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26519063","pubdate":"2015-11-01T22:00:21+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Bacteriology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"SRYTH: A New Yeast Two-Hybrid Method.","type":"article","volume":"1356","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sryth-new-yeast-twohybrid-method"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6516271,"mean":6.0347598107487,"rank":5558901,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6516271,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207706,"mean":10.272370737344,"rank":165476,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207706,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4653,"mean":1.5003804815133,"rank":3051,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4653,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":335,"mean":1.7143173652695,"rank":227,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":335,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/yeast_papers\/statuses\/660901402600800256","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4711635],"posted_on":"2015-11-01T19:29:07+00:00","author":{"name":"yeast_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yeast","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/470859351591092225\/S4XxHSFa_normal.jpeg","description":"Get your fresh daily #yeast #papers from #Pubmed, #Arxiv, #BioRxiv and #PeerJ here!
