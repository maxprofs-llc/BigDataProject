Mortality data were collected from the international GLOBOCAN database.\nAn overview of the main results was presented. In general, the most commonly diagnosed cancers in men are lung and prostates whereas in women, breast and cervical cancers are the pre-dominant cancers. Fifty nine percent and of breast and 65.7\u00a0% of cervical cancers in women are diagnosed at stages II and III. Cancer remains the second highest cause of mortality in Morocco.\nThe data provides a description of the cancer incidence and trends in the Moroccan population. The Moroccan national cancer program should aim for more coherent, consistent and comparable incidence data between different cancer registries in the country, and develop uniform datasets with respect to quality.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007a2","authors":["M.
