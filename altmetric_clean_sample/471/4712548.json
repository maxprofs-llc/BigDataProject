The properties of this \u03b2-glucosidase appear to include resistance to temperature, urea, and iodoacetamide, and it is activated by 2-ME, similar to other members. \u03b2-Glucosidase from chayote (Sechium edule) was purified by ionic-interchange chromatography and molecular exclusion chromatography. Peptides detected by LC-ESI-MS\/MS were compared with other \u03b2-glucosidases using the BLAST program. This enzyme is a 116 kDa protein composed of two sub-units of 58 kDa and shows homology with Cucumis sativus \u03b2-glucosidase (NCBI reference sequence XP_004154617.1), in which seven peptides were found with relative masses ranging from 874.3643 to 1587.8297. The stability of \u03b2-glucosidase depends on an initial concentration of 0.2 mg\/mL of protein at pH 5.0 which decreases by 33% in a period of 30 h, and then stabilizes and is active for the next 5 days (pH 4.0 gives similar results). One hundred \u03bcg\/mL \u03b2-D-glucose inhibited \u03b2-glucosidase activity by more than 50%. The enzyme had a Km of 4.88 mM with p-NPG and a Kcat of 10,000 min(-1). The optimal conditions for the enzyme require a pH of 4.0 and a temperature of 50 \u00b0C.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422e","authors":["Sergio Mateos"],"doi":"10.3390\/molecules201019372","first_seen_on":"2015-11-02T04:16:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1420-3049"],"issue":"10","journal":"Molecules","last_mentioned_on":1445611340,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/20\/10\/19372"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/20\/10\/19372\/pdf","pmid":"26512637","pubdate":"2015-10-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Purification and Partial Characterization of \u03b2-Glucosidase in Chayote (Sechium edule)","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/purification-partial-characterization-%CE%B2glucosidase-chayote-sechium-edule"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6391435,"mean":5.9810902648762,"rank":5443207,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6391435,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197191,"mean":10.481790445763,"rank":154792,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197191,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2595,"mean":2.1752181958365,"rank":1541,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2595,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189,"mean":1.0428617021277,"rank":135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
