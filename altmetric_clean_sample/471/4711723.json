The oligomeric state of IF1 related to pH is crucial for its inhibitory activity. Although extensive structural studies have been performed to characterize the oligomeric states of bovine IF1, only little is known concerning those of yeast IF1. While bovine IF1 can be found as an inhibitory dimer at low pH and a non-inhibitory tetramer at high pH, a monomer\/dimer equilibrium has been described for yeast IF1, high pH values favoring the monomeric state. Combining different strategies involving the grafting of nitroxide spin labels combined with Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, the present study brings the first structural characterization, at the residue level, of yeast IF1 in its dimeric form. The results show that the dimerization interface involves the central region of the peptide revealing that the dimer corresponds to a non-inhibitory state. Moreover we demonstrate that the C-terminal region of the peptide is highly dynamic and that this segment is probably folded back onto the central region. Finally, the pH-dependence of the inter-label distance distribution has been observed indicating a conformational change between two structural states in the dimer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c38","authors":["Le Breton, Nolwenn","Adrianaivomananjaona, Tiona","Gerbaud, Guillaume","Etienne, Emilien","Bisetto, Elena","Dautant, Alain","Guigliarelli, Bruno","Haraux, Francis","Martinho, Marl\u00e8ne","Belle, Val\u00e9rie"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbabio.2015.10.010","first_seen_on":"2015-11-01T21:03:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0006-3002"],"journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA)","last_mentioned_on":1446411785,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26518384?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26518384","pubdate":"2015-10-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Dimerization interface and dynamic properties of yeast IF1 revealed by site-directed spin labeling EPR spectroscopy.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dimerization-interface-dynamic-properties-yeast-if1-revealed-sitedirected-spin-labeling-epr-spectros"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6516271,"mean":6.0347598107487,"rank":5558900,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6516271,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207706,"mean":10.272364959919,"rank":165476,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207706,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4620,"mean":2.8025650573717,"rank":3901,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4620,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194,"mean":3.1787357512953,"rank":143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
