We aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of fetal and neonatal murine peripheral blood (FNPB) mononuclear cells and their impact on microRNA-145 (miR-145) in renal vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) of MRL\/lpr lupus-prone mice. MRL\/lpr mice aged 20 weeks were randomized to 3 groups of 15 (control group, radiation group, infusion group). The renal tissues were subjected to pathological examination. In situ hybridization assay was applied to measure miR-145 expression in renal vessels of MRL\/lpr mice. The infusion group had significantly better results for pathological renal tissue lesions than either the control or radiation group. In MRL\/lpr mice, there was positive expression of miR-145 in renal VSMCs, although the expression of miR-145 was not discernible in renal vascular intima and adventitia. The miR-145 expression in renal VSMCs in the infusion group was significantly higher than in the control or radiation group, and higher in the radiation group than in the control group; however, the difference was not statistically significant. The increased expression of miR-145 in renal VSMCs might be one of the mechanisms supporting FNPB as a therapy for lupus nephritis; it also suggests that the miR-145 in renal vessels might be a new target for treatment of lupus nephritis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003694","authors":["Wen, C","Liu, X Y","Wan, W Q","Yi, Z W"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.transproceed.2015.08.015","first_seen_on":"2015-11-01T14:23:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-2623"],"issue":"8","journal":"Transplantation Proceedings","last_mentioned_on":1446393508,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26518963?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26518963?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26518963","pubdate":"2015-11-01T22:00:23+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Effects of Fetal and Neonatal Murine Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells Infusion on MicroRNA-145 Expression in Renal Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells in MRL\/lpr Mice.","type":"article","volume":"47","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-fetal-neonatal-murine-peripheral-blood-mononuclear-cells-infusion-microrna145-expression-ren"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6516271,"mean":6.0347598107487,"rank":4818984,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":957417,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6516271,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207706,"mean":10.272391199056,"rank":142470,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":42230,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207706,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":931,"mean":1.3024602150538,"rank":422,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":370,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":931,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":0.42105263157895,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
