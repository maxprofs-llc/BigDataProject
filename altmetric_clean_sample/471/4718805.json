The bond is identified in the dimethylamine-trimethylphosphine complex by a redshift of the fundamental NH-stretching frequency observed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Based on the measured NH-stretching frequency redshifts, we find that P is a hydrogen bond acceptor atom similar in strength to S. Both are stronger acceptors than O and significantly weaker acceptors than N. The hydrogen bond angle, \u2220NHP, is found to be very sensitive to the functional employed in Density Functional Theory (DFT) optimizations of the complex and a possible parameter to assess the quality of DFT functionals. Natural Bonding Orbital (NBO) energies and results from the topological methods Atoms In Molecules (AIM) and Non-Covalent Interactions (NCI) indicate that the sensitivity is caused by the weakness of the hydrogen bond compared to secondary interactions. We find that B3LYP favours the hydrogen bond and M06-2X favours the secondary interactions leading to under- and overestimation, respectively, of the hydrogen bond angle relative to a DF-LCCSD(T)-F12a calculated angle. The remaining functionals tested, B3LYP-D3, B3LYP-D3BJ, CAM-B3LYP, \u03c9B97X-D, as well as MP2, show comparable contributions from the the hydrogen bond and the secondary interactions and are close to DF-LCCSD(T)-F12a results.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec4","authors":["Kristian H.
