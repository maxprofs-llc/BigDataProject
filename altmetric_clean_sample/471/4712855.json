In vivo studies were performed to evaluate the activities of two thiazolidinedione PPAR\u03b3 agonists, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, as inhibitors of oral carcinogenesis in rats. Oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) were induced in male F344 rats by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (NQO; 20 ppm in the drinking water for 10 weeks). In each study, groups of 30 NQO-treated rats were exposed to a PPAR\u03b3 agonist beginning at week 10 (one day after completion of NQO administration) or at week 17 (7 weeks post-NQO); chemopreventive agent exposure was continued until study termination at week 22 (rosiglitazone study) or week 24 (pioglitazone study). Administration of rosiglitazone (800 mg\/kg diet) beginning at week 10 increased survival, reduced oral cancer incidence, and reduced oral cancer invasion score in comparison to dietary controls; however, chemopreventive activity was largely lost when rosiglitazone administration was delayed until week 17. Administration of pioglitazone (500 mg\/kg diet beginning at week 10 or 1000 mg\/kg diet beginning at week 17) induced significant reductions in oral cancer incidence without significant effects on OSCC invasion scores. Transcript levels of PPAR\u03b3 and its three transcriptional variants (PPAR\u03b3v1, PPAR\u03b3v2, and PPAR\u03b3v3) were not significantly different in OSCC versus age- and site-matched phenotypically normal oral tissues from rats treated with NQO. These data suggest that PPAR\u03b3 provides a useful molecular target for oral cancer chemoprevention, and that overexpression of PPAR\u03b3 at the transcriptional level in neoplastic lesions is not essential for chemopreventive efficacy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["David L.
