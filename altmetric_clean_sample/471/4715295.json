Few reports concerning vagal nerve stimulation in patients with epileptic encephalopathy in the context of metabolic diseases have been published in the literature. Drug-resistant epilepsies in metabolic disease could be a specific target for vagal nerve stimulation, although the efficacy of this technique in these patients still needs to be proved. The authors report our experience in treating refractory epilepsy with vagal nerve stimulation in 2 patients affected by inborn errors of metabolism. The first patient is a 23-year-old patient affected by glutaric aciduria type II, the other one is a 16-month-old child with nonketotic hyperglycinemia. Vagal nerve stimulation reduced seizures up to 50% in the first case and up to 90% in the second one.","altmetric_jid":"58342a547ac79ecf5731c77e","authors":["Daniele Grioni","Andrea Landi","Serena Gasperini","Andrea Trezza","Leonardo Fiori","Miriam Rigoldi","Rossella Parini","Erik Pietro Sganzerla"],"doi":"10.1177\/2329048x15612432","first_seen_on":"2015-11-03T10:05:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["2329-048X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Child Neurology Open","last_mentioned_on":1449275704,"links":["http:\/\/cno.sagepub.com\/content\/2\/4\/2329048X15612432.full?utm_source=SAGE_social&hootPostID=cd5f4ecfa9fb3493619e5f9c71268d2b","http:\/\/cno.sagepub.com\/content\/2\/4\/2329048X15612432.full?utm_source=SAGE_social&hootPostID=f8609aa3d43636768629a5dea58fa659","http:\/\/cno.sagepub.com\/content\/2\/4\/2329048X15612432.short?utm_source=hootsuite","http:\/\/cno.sagepub.com\/content\/2\/4\/2329048X15612432.full?utm_source=SAGE_social&hootPostID=02880c32be9686b37ac1f59bdc157577"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/cno.sagepub.com\/content\/2\/4\/2329048X15612432.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC5417020","pmid":"28503597","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Vagal Nerve Stimulation in the Treatment of Drug-Resistant Epileptic Encephalopathies in Inborn Errors of Metabolism Report of 2 Cases","type":"article","volume":"2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6650505,"mean":6.1597281108294,"rank":2758174,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3739748,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6650505,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236512,"mean":9.4324575093758,"rank":99251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":129271,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236512,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":0.81153846153846,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.625,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SAGENeurology\/statuses\/661484284465815552","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4715295],"posted_on":"2015-11-03T10:05:17+00:00","author":{"name":"SAGE Neurology","url":"http:\/\/www.sagepublications.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/718100766502682624\/SFQVG34R_normal.jpg","description":"Follow us for the latest info on SAGE Publishing neurology and neuroscience, as well as general news items of interest.","id_on_source":"SAGENeurology","tweeter_id":"1510761841","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2517},"tweet_id":"661484284465815552"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SAGENeurology\/statuses\/665999048353148928","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4715295],"posted_on":"2015-11-15T21:05:21+00:00","author":{"name":"SAGE Neurology","url":"http:\/\/www.sagepublications.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/718100766502682624\/SFQVG34R_normal.jpg","description":"Follow us for the latest info on SAGE Publishing neurology and neuroscience, as well as general news items of interest.","id_on_source":"SAGENeurology","tweeter_id":"1510761841","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2517},"tweet_id":"665999048353148928"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PedsEpilepsyDoc\/statuses\/666014598793940993","license":"gnip","rt":["SAGENeurology"],"citation_ids":[4715295],"posted_on":"2015-11-15T22:07:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Anup Patel, M.D.","url":"http:\/\/nationwidechildrens.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000172188367\/adedc437ff7098eee44bba2335a1ad7f_normal.jpeg","description":"I'm the Section Chief of #neurology @nationwidekids & faculty @OhioState.
