In this study, we tried to detect the protective effect and potential mechanism of JUA on ISO-induced cardiomyocytes injury. H9C2 cells were treated with ISO to induce cell damage. Cells were pretreated with JUA to investigate the effects on the cell viability, morphological changes, light chain 3 conversion, and the activation of PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR signaling pathway. Results showed that ISO significantly inhibited the cell viability in a time- and dose-dependent manner. JUA pretreatment could reverse the reduction of cell viability and better the injury of H9C2 cells induced by ISO. Western blot analysis showed that JUA could accelerate the phosphorylation of PI3K, Akt, and mTOR. Results also indicated that JUA could significantly decrease the ratio of microtubule-associated protein LC3-II\/I in H9C2 cells. Taken together, our research showed that JUA could notably reduce the damage cause by ISO via promoting the phosphorylation of PI3K, Akt, and mTOR and inhibiting LC3 conversion, which may be a potential choice for the treatment of heart diseases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5243cf058f610003c64","authors":["Han, Dandan"],"doi":"10.1155\/2016\/9593716","first_seen_on":"2016-05-16T15:11:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1741-427X","1741-4288"],"journal":"Evidence-based Complementary & Alternative Medicine (eCAM)","last_mentioned_on":1463470206,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2016\/9593716\/","http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2016\/9593716\/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2016\/9593716.pdf","pmcid":"PMC4884826","pmid":"27293469","pubdate":"2016-05-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Jujuboside A Protects H9C2 Cells from Isoproterenol-Induced Injury via Activating PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR Signaling Pathway","type":"article","volume":"2016","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/jujuboside-protects-h9c2-cells-isoproterenolinduced-injury-via-activating-pi3kaktmtor-signaling-path"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7711702,"mean":6.6147835493025,"rank":5831201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1040880,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7711702,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269583,"mean":11.456207558367,"rank":188569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":44630,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269583,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3846,"mean":4.5456327698309,"rank":2268,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":1069,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3846,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":137,"mean":2.4242352941176,"rank":95,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":137,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Other":1,"Professor":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MBHolistic\/statuses\/732226921849716736","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7531470],"posted_on":"2016-05-16T15:11:16+00:00","author":{"name":"Monterey Holistic","url":"http:\/\/www.montereybayholistic.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/793206537254686724\/_c1aiyQP_normal.jpg","description":"501(c)3 #health #education #exercise #healthnews #nutrition #holistic #fitness #wellness #inspirational #healing #success #quotes #yoga #chiropractic #fitness","id_on_source":"MBHolistic","tweeter_id":"28173797","geo":{"lt":37.25022,"ln":-119.75126,"country":"US"},"followers":28305},"tweet_id":"732226921849716736"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/lolitsjournals\/statuses\/732473253428531200","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7531470],"posted_on":"2016-05-17T07:30:06+00:00","author":{"name":"lolitsjournals","url":"http:\/\/keeganmclean.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/652288661413695488\/TMbtKL-d_normal.jpg","description":"Current journals on all things Chiropractic.
