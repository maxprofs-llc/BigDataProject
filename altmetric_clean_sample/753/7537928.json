Follow-up surveillance computed tomograph 6-months following the surgery found an incidental 4cm lesion in the left kidney which avidly enhanced in the arterial phase, consistent with a renal pseudoaneurysm. She was completely asymptomatic. Renal pseudoaneurysm is rare complication following minimally invasive nephron sparing surgery and typically presents in the early post-operative period with gross haematuria. However, a large renal pseudoaneurysm may also present as an asymptomatic incidental finding and is amenable to angioembolization.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036e4","authors":["Peter E.
