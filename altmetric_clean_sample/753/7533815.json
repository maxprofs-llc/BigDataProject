Eighteen suspected impaired driving cases were determined to have \u03b1-PVP concentrations <0.005-0.09 mg\/L. Three fatalities during this period were determined to have \u03b1-PVP concentrations ranging from 0.03 to >20 mg\/L. Human use of synthetic cathinones like \u03b1-PVP has been reported to induce psychological effects such as delusions, paranoia, hallucinations and deleterious cardiovascular effects. Quantitation was performed using a liquid-liquid extraction with detection by liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry using electrospray ionization in a multiple reaction monitoring mode. The reported behaviors in the 18 suspected impaired driving cases ranged from central nervous system depression to eluding officers in a high speed chase. The mean and median DUID \u03b1-PVP concentrations were both 0.030 mg\/L. The \u03b1-PVP concentrations in the three fatalities were determined to be 0.033, 0.054 and present >20 mg\/L. In 18 DUID cases, only 4 cases reported side effects consistent with synthetic cathinones. Two of the three fatalities indicated histories of bath salt and\/or recreational drug use. At this time, no correlation can be determined between side effects and \u03b1-PVP concentrations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c7e","authors":["Trista Haupt Wright","Chad Harris","Wright, Trista Haupt","Harris, Chad"],"doi":"10.1093\/jat\/bkw029","endpage":"402","first_seen_on":"2016-05-16T17:15:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1945-2403","0146-4760"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Analytical Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1481062784,"links":["http:\/\/jat.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/40\/5\/396.abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27185821?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27185821"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jat.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/40\/5\/396.full.pdf","pmid":"27185821","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"396","title":"Twenty-One Cases Involving Alpha-Pyrrolidinovalerophenone (\u03b1-PVP)","type":"article","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/twentyone-cases-involving-alphapyrrolidinovalerophenone-%CE%B1pvp"},"altmetric_score":{"score":109.83,"score_history":{"1y":107.08,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":109.83},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7851688,"mean":6.6523167403332,"rank":65678,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":7785980,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7851688,"percentile":99},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270263,"mean":11.469048493684,"rank":5283,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":264979,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270263,"percentile":98},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":761,"mean":5.4544605263158,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":756,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":761,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.5978260869565,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
