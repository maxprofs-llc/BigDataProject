Herein, we designed two ligand drug conjugates by conjugating GalNAc (N-Acetylgalactosamine, a hepatocyte-targeting ligand) with atorvastatin. These two conjugates, termed G-AT and G-K-AT, exhibited enhanced water solubility and cellular uptake. Moreover, both G-AT and G-K-AT were able to release atorvastatin and consequently achieved significant inhibition against 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c4a","authors":["Xinfu Zhang","Xiaofang Chen","Weiyu Zhao","Chunxi Zeng","Xiao Luo","Wenqing Li","Bin Li","Justin Jiang","Yizhou Dong"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.bioconjchem.7b00295","first_seen_on":"2017-08-10T17:45:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1043-1802","1520-4812"],"journal":"Bioconjugate Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1502537360,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.bioconjchem.7b00295?hootPostID=e15ada957fab6561fbaa2bd4b6bd0153","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/acs.bioconjchem.7b00295"],"pmid":"28745862","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"GalNAc Conjugated Atorvastatin with Enhanced Water Solubility and Cellular Internalization","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/glcnac-conjugated-atorvastatin-enhanced-water-solubility-cellular-internalization"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":1.85,"6m":1.85,"3m":1.85,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8360145,"mean":7.0505745135414,"rank":3753917,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4513962,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8360145,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":183479,"mean":12.556361961652,"rank":76420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":104143,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":183479,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":827,"mean":2.4502348668281,"rank":248,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":563,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":827,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":2.034375,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BioconjChem\/statuses\/895702607594913792","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23569566],"posted_on":"2017-08-10T17:45:17+00:00","author":{"name":"Bioconjugate Chem","url":"http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/journal\/bcches","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/578635839212752898\/DlsZgNpb_normal.jpeg","description":"ACS journal that presents research relevant to all aspects of conjugation chemistry and biochemistry.","id_on_source":"BioconjChem","tweeter_id":"2270793247","geo":{"lt":38.91706,"ln":-77.00025,"country":"US"},"followers":1345},"tweet_id":"895702607594913792"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jomirobyl\/statuses\/895704379671678976","license":"gnip","rt":["BioconjChem"],"citation_ids":[23569566],"posted_on":"2017-08-10T17:52:20+00:00","author":{"name":"J\uf8ffan Miralles","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/851439238965063680\/nh4iTNCn_normal.jpg","description":"Rebel cl\u00e0ssic","id_on_source":"jomirobyl","tweeter_id":"384896223","geo":{"lt":39.69634,"ln":2.69955,"country":"ES"},"followers":509},"tweet_id":"895704379671678976"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/dizzles22\/statuses\/896332772092129281","license":"gnip","rt":["BioconjChem"],"citation_ids":[23569566],"posted_on":"2017-08-12T11:29:20+00:00","author":{"name":"deirdre","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/572923513419522048\/NcgT0fo5_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"dizzles22","tweeter_id":"2233482664","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":31},"tweet_id":"896332772092129281"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Timeline Photos","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1831306060425196&id=1384498761772597","license":"public","citation_ids":[23569566],"posted_on":"2017-08-10T17:45:05+00:00","summary":"Improving drug properties have been widely studied looking to improve pharmaceutical profiles.
