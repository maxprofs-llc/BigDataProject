The proposed fiber biosensor utilized a micro-cavity within a single-mode fiber to induce Mach-Zehnder interference. A remarkable feature of this biosensor is that external media can directly interact with the fiber core signal through microfluidic channels connected to the micro-cavity and sensor surface. The device was fabricated by means of femtosecond laser micromachining and chemical etching. A fiber interferometer of this type exhibits an ultrahigh refractive index sensitivity of -10,055 nm\/RIU and a detection limit of 3.5 \u00d7 10(-5) RIU. Different concentrations of BSA with an infinitesimally small refractive index difference can be clearly differentiated in situ by the interferential spectra of the structure. Experiments demonstrated the biosensor exhibited a BSA solution concentration sensitivity of -38.9 nm\/(mg\/mL) and a detection limit of 2.57 \u00d7 10(-4) mg\/mL, respectively. Moreover, this biosensor is a sub-microliter dose and ultrasensitive at the low concentrations detected in BSA, which make it a promising for biochemical applications such as DNA hybridization, cancer screenings, medicine examination and environmental engineering, etc.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f6100083d6","authors":["Li, Zhengyong","Liao, Changrui","Chen, Danni","Song, Jun","Jin, Wei","Peng, Gang-Ding","Zhu, Feng","Wang, Ying","He, Jun","Wang, Yiping"],"first_seen_on":"2017-08-10T14:51:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1094-4087"],"issue":"15","journal":"Optics Express Online","last_mentioned_on":1502418526,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28789206?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28789206","pubdate":"2017-07-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Optical Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Communications Technologies","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biophysics","ophthalmology"],"title":"Label-free detection of bovine serum albumin based on an in-fiber Mach-Zehnder interferometric biosensor.","type":"article","volume":"25"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0.75,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8355069,"mean":7.046560105308,"rank":6041401,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2015059,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8355069,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180863,"mean":12.529502725835,"rank":117098,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":53115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180863,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2112,"mean":6.3935253434391,"rank":1427,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":655,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2112,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108,"mean":3.7909158878505,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1,"CN":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BiosensorPapers\/statuses\/895658764270829568","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23562801],"posted_on":"2017-08-10T14:51:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Biosensor Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/706647650213363712\/BpK5-z3e_normal.jpg","description":"Pubmed Twitterbot for #biosensor papers.
