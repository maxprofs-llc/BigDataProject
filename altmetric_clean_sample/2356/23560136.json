The objectives of this study were to describe and evaluate the use of a three-dimensional (3-D) printing technique for personalized reconstructive surgery for repairing orbital fractures.\nA total of 29 cases which had 3-D technique-assisted surgical reconstruction, and 27 cases which had traditional surgery, were retrospectively analyzed. Preoperative and postoperative CT images were measured using MIMICS software, and the contour of the fracture zone and the Medpor-titanium implant were analyzed and compared. The surgical duration was also compared between the two groups.\nThere were statistically significant differences in the maximum width, depth and area between fracture zone and implant between the two groups, with the absolute value in the 3-D group markedly lower as compared to the control group. In addition, the difference in the medial-inferior wall angle between the surgical eye and healthy eye was also statistically significant between the groups. The average surgical duration in the 3-D group was substantially shorter than in the control group. Additionally, the postoperative clinical evaluation in the 3-D group was superior to that of the control group.\nThe 3-D printing technique is of great value for predicting the precise fracture zone before, and during, personalized surgery, and can help surgeons achieve accurate anatomical reconstruction for repairs of blowout orbital fractures. Moreover, the simulated bone template produced by 3-D printing models allows for \"true-to-original\" orbital reconstruction, which can shorten the surgical duration and improve the accuracy and safety of the operation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002982","authors":["Fan, Bin","Chen, Han","Sun, Ying-Jian","Wang, Bei-Fen","Che, Lin","Liu, Shu-Yan","Li, Guang-Yu"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00417-017-3766-y","first_seen_on":"2017-08-10T13:28:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0721-832X","1435-702X"],"journal":"Graefe's Archive of Clinical & Experimental Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1502446076,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28786025"],"pmid":"28786025","pubdate":"2017-08-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Clinical effects of 3-D printing-assisted personalized reconstructive surgery for blowout orbital fractures","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-effects-3d-printingassisted-personalized-reconstructive-surgery-blowout-orbital-fractures"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0.75,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8355069,"mean":7.046560105308,"rank":6041396,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2015076,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8355069,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180875,"mean":12.528642436171,"rank":117096,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":53126,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180875,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":710,"mean":1.7837009873061,"rank":342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":339,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":710,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.0944444444444,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NIHL3D\/statuses\/895637956265861121","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23560136],"posted_on":"2017-08-10T13:28:23+00:00","author":{"name":"NIHL 3D Printing","url":"http:\/\/nihlibrary.nih.gov","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/535844758770311168\/TEZkAxsL_normal.png","description":"National Institutes of Health Library","id_on_source":"NIHL3D","tweeter_id":"2887052859","geo":{"lt":38.98067,"ln":-77.10026,"country":"US"},"followers":746},"tweet_id":"895637956265861121"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/dqbito\/statuses\/895949900336254976","license":"gnip","rt":["NIHL3D"],"citation_ids":[23560136],"posted_on":"2017-08-11T10:07:56+00:00","author":{"name":"DQbito Ing.Biom\u00e9dica","url":"http:\/\/WWW.DQBITO.COM","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/782887577829466112\/6QfDthZb_normal.jpg","description":"Ingenier\u00eda e impresi\u00f3n 3D biom\u00e9dica en entornos hospitalarios.
