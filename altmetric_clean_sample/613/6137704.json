Children with epilepsy experience numerous neuropsychological comorbidities, including cognitive deficiencies and emotional\/behavioral difficulties; thus, it is reasonable to consider the moderating role of sleep in this population. This review summarizes findings involving the prevalence and characteristics of sleep problems often experienced by children with epilepsy. The complex and bidirectional relationship between sleep and seizure frequency is discussed. Research pertaining to the relationship between sleep disturbance and daytime cognition as well as behavior reveals a substantial association between these variables. Clinically relevant practices related to the assessment and treatment of sleep-related complications are reviewed, and directions for further research involving intervention and assessment are also reviewed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027f5","authors":["Beattie, Julia F","Koch, Sarah A","Bolden, Lauren B","Thompson, Matthew D"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.yebeh.2016.01.037","first_seen_on":"2016-03-08T10:25:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1525-5069"],"issue":"Pt A","journal":"Epilepsy & Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1457430643,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26949152"],"pmid":"26949152","pubdate":"2016-03-08T10:26:31+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences","neurology"],"title":"Neuropsychological consequences of sleep disturbance in children with epilepsy","type":"article","volume":"57","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neuropsychological-consequences-sleep-disturbance-children-epilepsy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7367623,"mean":6.4006371575483,"rank":5571352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":995378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7367623,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280240,"mean":10.74256258408,"rank":196751,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":43890,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280240,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1161,"mean":4.3471206896552,"rank":868,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":170,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1161,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":2.1521276595745,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
