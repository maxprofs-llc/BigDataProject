Two-fifths of inpatients who received at least one of the five frequently used hospital-initiated antibiotics (ceftriaxone, metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin and azithromycin) missed at least one antibiotic dose-day (44%, 243\/558). The per-day risk of missed antibiotic administration was greatest on day 1: ceftriaxone (36%, 143\/398), metronidazole (27%, 67\/245), ciprofloxacin (34%, 39\/114) and all inpatients who missed at least one dose-day of prescribed amoxicillin and azithromycin. Most patients received fewer doses than were prescribed: ceftriaxone (74%, 273\/371), ciprofloxacin (90%, 94\/105) and metronidazole (97%, 222\/230). Of prescribed doses, only 62% of ceftriaxone doses (1178\/1895), 35% of ciprofloxacin doses (396\/1130) and 27% of metronidazole doses (1043\/3862) were administered. Seven percent (13\/188) of patients on intravenous metronidazole and 6% (5\/87) on intravenous ciprofloxacin switched to oral route.\nHigh rates of antibiotic use both pre-admission and during hospitalization were observed, with low parenteral\/oral switch of hospital-initiated antibiotics. Underadministration of prescribed antibiotics was common, especially on the day of prescription, risking loss of efficacy and antibiotic resistance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c89","authors":["Kiguba, Ronald","Karamagi, Charles","Bird, Sheila M","Ronald Kiguba","Charles Karamagi","Sheila M.
