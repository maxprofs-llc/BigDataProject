Twenty percent of nulliparous women seem to exhibit a mild or moderate fear, while 6% present an excessive and irrational fear known as tocophobia. Tocophobia is suggested to be associated with many negative consequences such as postpartum depression (PPD) and Post-traumatic stress (PTS). However, there is little empirical evidence to support these relationships. Recently, Fairbrother and Woody (2007) did not observe a link between the fear of childbirth and symptoms of PPD and PTS in nulliparous women. Some results, near the significance level, could be explained by a lack of statistical power. The present study focused on the link between the fear of childbirth and the process of delivery, the perception of pain, PPD and PTS. More specifically, it aimed to test three hypotheses: (i) fear of childbirth will be linked to the process of delivery, especially regarding the perception of pain, the use of anaesthesia and the use of Caesarean section; (ii) a high level of fear of childbirth will be associated with more negative postpartum consequences (namely PPD\/PTS symptoms); (iii) the process of delivery and pain will also be related to post-delivery symptoms. Mediation effects were tested.\nData from a longitudinal study were used to meet the hypotheses. A total of 176 nulliparous pregnant women responded to questionnaires at two time measurements (during pregnancy and at 5weeks postpartum).\nFear of childbirth is related to the perception of pain at birth among women delivering vaginally, in the absence of anaesthesia. It is also linked to symptoms of PPD and PTS, regardless of whether or not anaesthesia was used. Fear of childbirth also appears to be strongly associated to symptoms of PTS in women who have experienced an unplanned caesarean section. Thus, symptoms of postpartum PTS could play a mediating role in the link between fear of childbirth and PPD.\nThese results support the relevance of taking into account the fear of childbirth and perception of pain in connection with symptoms of PTS and PPD in nulliparous women. The unplanned caesarean section (including emergency caesarean) also appears to be important in the study of the relationship between fear and symptoms of PTS. Fear of childbirth could render the experience of childbearing more negative and predispose to PTS and PPD. Enabling psychological vulnerabilities could also be an interesting avenue for understanding these links. Limitations are discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007fb2","authors":["Gosselin, P","Chabot, K","B\u00e9land, M","Goulet-Gervais, L","Morin, A J S"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.encep.2016.01.007","first_seen_on":"2016-03-08T03:31:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0013-7006","00137006"],"issue":"2","journal":"L'Enc\u00e9phale","last_mentioned_on":1468068476,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0013700616000324","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26924001?platform=hootsuite"],"pmid":"26924001","pubdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["brain"],"title":"La peur de l\u2019accouchement chez des nullipares\u00a0: lien avec la douleur lors de l\u2019accouchement, les sympt\u00f4mes de stress post-traumatique et les sympt\u00f4mes d\u00e9pressifs post-partum ","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/la-peur-laccouchement-chez-des-nullipares-lien-avec-la-douleur-lors-laccouchement-les-sympt%C3%B4mes-stre"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.55,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8037685,"mean":6.8229478924494,"rank":1638679,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6391831,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8037685,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285166,"mean":10.987669650904,"rank":73949,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":210783,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285166,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":471,"mean":2.4216680851064,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":413,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":471,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":2.5714285714286,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
