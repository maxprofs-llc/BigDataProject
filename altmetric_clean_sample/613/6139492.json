Inadequate management strategies can have negative consequences on soil quality. We studied how the age and type of vegetation cover and several environmental characteristics (lithology, soil properties, vineyard slope and so on) after vineyard uprooting and abandonment contribute to the variation patterns in total, HAc (acetic acid-method, HAc) and EDTA-extractable (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-method) concentrations of Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn in soils. We sampled 141 points from vineyards and abandoned vineyard Mediterranean soils recolonized by natural vegetation in recent decades. The contribution of several environmental variables (e.g. age and type of vegetation cover, lithology, soil properties and vineyard slope) to the total and extractable concentrations of metals was evaluated by canonical ordination based on redundancy analysis, considering the interaction between both environmental and response variables. The ranges of total metal contents were: 0.01-0.15 (Cd), 2.6-34 (Cu), 6.6-30 (Pb), and 29-92mgkg(-1) (Zn). Cadmium (11-100%) had the highest relative extractability with both extractants, and Zn and Pb the lowest. The total and EDTA-extractable of Cd, Pb and Zn were positively related to the age of abandonment, to the presence of Agrostis castellana and Retama sphaerocarpa, and to the contents of Fe-oxides, clay and organic matter (OM). A different pattern was noted for Cu, positively related to vineyard soils. Soil properties successfully explained HAc-extractable Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn but the age and type of vegetation cover lost significance. Clay content was negatively related to HAc-extractable Cu and Pb; and OM was positively related to HAc-Cd and Zn. In conclusion, the time elapsed after vineyard uprooting, and subsequent land abandonment, affects the soil content and availability of metals, and this impact depended on the colonizing plant species and soil properties.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100034e7","authors":["Ana de Santiago-Mart\u00edn","Cristina Vaquero Perea","Inmaculada Valverde Asenjo","Jose R Quintana Nieto","Concepci\u00f3n Gonz\u00e1lez Huecas","Antonio L Lafuente","Antonio V\u00e1zquez de la Cueva"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2016.01.185","endpage":"65","first_seen_on":"2016-03-08T13:57:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-1026","0048-9697"],"journal":"Science of the Total Environment","last_mentioned_on":1457526646,"links":["https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/293944514_Impact_of_vineyard_abandonment_and_natural_recolonization_on_metal_content_and_availability_in_Mediterranean_soils"],"pmid":"26874761","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"57","subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Impact of vineyard abandonment and natural recolonization on metal content and availability in Mediterranean soils","type":"article","volume":"551-552","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-vineyard-abandonment-natural-recolonization-metal-content-availability-mediterranean-soils"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7372759,"mean":6.4055135958582,"rank":5317475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1797426,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7372759,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280289,"mean":10.743567787418,"rank":181060,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":83460,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280289,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4375,"mean":4.7860096021948,"rank":3283,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1001,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4375,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179,"mean":7.9225617977528,"rank":121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":55,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
