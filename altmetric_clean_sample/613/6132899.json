Discharge outcomes included change in motor and total FIM scores from admission to discharge, discharge residential status, and length of stay.\nMean age was 81.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.4\u00a0years and 68.3% were women. Mean changes in motor and total FIM were 21.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.2 (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and 22.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.0 (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), respectively. On admission, only 30.8% of patients were ambulatory even with mobility assistive devices, while on discharge, 68.3% of patients were ambulatory; 61.5% of patients returned to their preadmission living arrangement; 8.6% went from their own home to a retirement or relative's home. Only 16.3% were discharged to long-term nursing home care and 13.4% were transferred to an acute hospital. Mean length of SSR stay was 82.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a026.4\u00a0days.\nSSR programs can benefit elderly patients at risk for institutionalization after acute hospitalization by improving their functioning and mobility, and allowing them to return to the community.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037a9","authors":["Grace Leung","Paul R.
