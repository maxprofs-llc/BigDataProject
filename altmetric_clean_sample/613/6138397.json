Muscle activity was assessed by electromyography during abduction and adduction of the affected and unaffected arms. The main principal aim of the study was to compare shoulder muscle activity in the affected and unaffected shoulder during elevation of the arm. A multivariate linear mixed model was introduced and applied to address the principal aims. The result of fitting this model to the data shows a huge improvement as compared to the alternatives.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61d3cf058f6100078a4","authors":["Oskrochi, Gholamreza","Lesaffre, Emmanuel","Oskrochi, Youssof","Shamley, Delva"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijerph13030274","first_seen_on":"2016-03-08T11:54:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1660-4601"],"issue":"3","journal":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1457436251,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26950134?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26950134","pubdate":"2016-03-08T22:00:33+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth","environmentalhealth"],"title":"An Application of the Multivariate Linear Mixed Model to the Analysis of Shoulder Complexity in Breast Cancer Patients","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/application-multivariate-linear-mixed-model-analysis-shoulder-complexity-breast-cancer-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7367623,"mean":6.4006371575483,"rank":5571359,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":995334,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7367623,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280240,"mean":10.742583994376,"rank":196750,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":43871,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280240,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2613,"mean":7.1591209800919,"rank":1904,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":376,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2613,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178,"mean":5.1477514124294,"rank":120,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
