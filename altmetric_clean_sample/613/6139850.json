Altogether, 1,049 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 1,088 oldest-old (age 92-93 years) Danes and analysed with phenotype data on physical functioning (hand grip strength), cognitive functioning (mini mental state examination and a cognitive composite score), activity of daily living and self-rated health. Five SNPs showed association to one of the phenotypes; however, none of these SNPs were associated with a change in the relevant phenotype over time (7 years of follow-up) and none of the SNPs could be confirmed in a replication sample of 1,281 oldest-old Danes (age 94-100). Hence, our study does not support association between common variation in the investigated longevity candidate genes and aging-related phenotypes consistently shown to predict survival. It is possible that larger sample sizes are needed to robustly reveal associations with small effect sizes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002894","authors":["Mette Soerensen","Marianne Nygaard","Birgit Debrabant","Jonas Mengel-From","Serena Dato","Mikael Thinggaard","Kaare Christensen","Lene Christiansen","Soerensen, Mette","Nygaard, Marianne","Debrabant, Birgit","Mengel-From, Jonas","Dato, Serena","Thinggaard, Mikael","Christensen, Kaare","Christiansen, Lene"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.exger.2016.03.001","first_seen_on":"2016-03-08T15:50:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["05315565","1873-6815"],"journal":"Experimental Gerontology","last_mentioned_on":1463960524,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0531556516300596","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26946122","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.exger.2016.03.001"],"pmid":"26946122","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"No Association between Variation in Longevity Candidate Genes and Aging-related Phenotypes in Oldest-old Danes","type":"article","volume":"78","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-between-variation-longevity-candidate-genes-agingrelated-phenotypes-oldestold-danes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":15.408,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":15.408},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8047191,"mean":6.8378746593499,"rank":524753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7523308,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8047191,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285207,"mean":11.000803419283,"rank":27880,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":257327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285207,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1009,"mean":5.6184702380952,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":941,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1009,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":3.4857142857143,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":6},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":6,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
