However, the effects of ultrasonic clutter on TSI have not been considered. In this study, we evaluated whether pulse inversion harmonic imaging (PIHI) could be used to improve estimates of thermal (temporal) strain. Using mixed castor oil-gelatin phantoms of different concentrations and artificially introduced clutter, we found that PIHI improved the signal-to-noise ratio of TSI by an average of 213% or 52.1% relative to 3.3- and 6.6-MHz imaging, respectively. In a phantom constructed using human liposuction fat in the presence of clutter, the contrast-to-noise ratio was degraded by 35.1% for PIHI compared with 62.4% and 43.7% for 3.3- and 6.6-MHz imaging, respectively. These findings were further validated using an ex\u00a0vivo carotid endarterectomy sample. PIHI can be used to improve estimates of thermal (temporal) strain in the presence of clutter.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036d2","authors":["Ding, Xuan","Nguyen, Man M","James, Isaac B","Marra, Kacey G","Rubin, J Peter","Leers, Steven A","Kim, Kang"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ultrasmedbio.2016.01.007","first_seen_on":"2016-03-08T15:49:30+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["1879-291X","03015629"],"journal":"Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology","last_mentioned_on":1457447722,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26948260?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26948260","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Improved Estimation of Ultrasound Thermal Strain Using Pulse Inversion Harmonic Imaging","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/improved-estimation-ultrasound-thermal-strain-using-pulse-inversion-harmonic-imaging-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7367723,"mean":6.4010630515065,"rank":6372515,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7367723,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280240,"mean":10.742633773315,"rank":236435,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280240,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":515,"mean":2.0278054474708,"rank":398,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":515,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":1.6722222222222,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
