HDACs can modulate the expression of various genes, which directly or indirectly affect glucose metabolism. This study was aimed to evaluate the role of valproic acid (VPA) on fat deposition, insulin-resistance and gluconeogenesis in type-2 diabetic rat. Diabetes was developed in Sprague-Dawley rats by the combination of high-fat diet and low dose streptozotocin. VPA at the doses of 150 and 300 mg\/kg\/day and metformin (positive control) 150 mg\/kg twice daily for 10 weeks were administered by oral gavage. Insulin-resistance, dyslipidemia and glycemia were evaluated by biochemical estimations, while fat accumulation and structural alteration were assessed by histopathology. Protein expression and insulin signaling were evaluated by western blot and immunohistochemistry. VPA treatment significantly reduced the plasma glucose, HbA1c, insulin-resistance, fat deposition in brown adipose tissue, white adipose tissue and liver, which are comparable to metformin treatment. Further, VPA inhibited the gluconeogenesis and glucagon expression as well as restored the histopathological alterations in pancreas and liver. Our findings provide new insights on the anti-diabetic role of VPA in type-2 diabetes mellitus by the modulation of insulin signaling and forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1)-mediated gluconeogenesis. Since VPA is a well established clinical drug, the detailed molecular mechanisms of the present findings can be further investigated for possible clinical use.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c8","authors":["Khan, Sabbir","Kumar, Sandeep","Jena, Gopabandhu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.biochi.2016.02.014","first_seen_on":"2016-03-07T13:32:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1638-6183"],"journal":"Biochimie","last_mentioned_on":1457370009,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26944797","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26944797?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26944797","pubdate":"2016-03-07T22:00:22+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Valproic acid reduces insulin-resistance, fat deposition and FOXO1-mediated gluconeogenesis in type-2 diabetic rat","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/valproic-acid-reduces-insulinresistance-fat-deposition-foxo1mediated-gluconeogenesis-type2-diabetic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7361309,"mean":6.3962513384811,"rank":3774798,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2064048,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7361309,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280306,"mean":10.712756761385,"rank":151621,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":99492,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280306,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":803,"mean":2.4272543640898,"rank":452,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":277,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":803,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":1.9714285714286,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
