A single, random maternal breast milk sample was collected and analyzed weekly for 6 consecutive weeks. Analysis was by mid-infrared spectroscopy.\nTwenty women consented to provide at least one milk sample. Fat, protein and energy content varied widely among mothers and by week of lactation. Energy content ranged from 9.5 to 30.4\u2009kcal\u2009oz(-1) across the study period. Twenty-five percent of all samples had an energy content <17\u2009kcal\u2009oz(-1). Protein content ranged from 1.1 to 2.8\u2009g\u2009dl(-1) in the first week. Sixty-three percent of all samples had a protein content <1.5\u2009g\u2009dl(-1). Fat and energy showed trends of increasing concentrations, whereas protein showed the expected decline over time. Lactose showed little variability by woman or by week of lactation.\nHM fat and protein content varied widely by individual woman over time. Week-to-week variability in fat and protein can impact growth. The ability to analyze HM is helpful to improve fortification of HM.Journal of Perinatology advance online publication, 29 September 2016; doi:10.1038\/jp.2016.170.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002eb2","authors":["Arnold, M","Adamkin, D","Radmacher, P","M Arnold","D Adamkin","P Radmacher"],"doi":"10.1038\/jp.2016.170","endpage":"196","first_seen_on":"2016-10-05T12:02:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1476-5543","0743-8346"],"journal":"Journal of Perinatology","last_mentioned_on":1485778865,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27684418","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/jp.2016.170","http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/jp\/rss\/aop\/~3\/yhaOHJmhgY8\/jp.2016.170","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/jp\/journal\/v37\/n2\/full\/jp2016170a.html"],"pmid":"27684418","pubdate":"2016-09-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Health care","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Paediatrics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"194","subjects":["perinatology"],"title":"Improving fortification with weekly analysis of human milk for VLBW infants","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/jp.2016.170","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/improving-fortification-weekly-analysis-human-milk-vlbw-infants"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8154593,"mean":6.8923629076653,"rank":4094380,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3853253,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8154593,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248983,"mean":12.756908676129,"rank":127282,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":112652,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248983,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1077,"mean":7.3052397769517,"rank":767,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1077,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":16.252111111111,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NICU_Musings\/statuses\/783638530035625984","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12443038],"posted_on":"2016-10-05T12:02:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Winnipegneonatal","url":"https:\/\/winnipegneonatal.wordpress.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/571706207073628160\/q4jpv9st_normal.jpeg","description":"A Neonatologist practicing in Canada.
