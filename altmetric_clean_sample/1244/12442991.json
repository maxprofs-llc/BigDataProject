We show that six Cys residues of a precursor peptide are first cyclodehydrated and oxidized to thiazoles in an ordered, but non-linear fashion that is leader peptide-dependent. Then four alcohols are glutamylated and converted to alkenes in a C-to-N terminal directional process that is leader peptide-independent. Finally, two of these alkenes undergo a formal [4+2] cycloaddition to form a tri-thiazole-substituted pyridine macrocycle. We describe here the factors that govern the substrate specificity and order of biosynthetic events that turn a ribosomal peptide into a powerful antibiotic.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Zhengan Zhang"],"doi":"10.1021\/jacs.6b08987","first_seen_on":"2016-10-05T12:00:46+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms"],"issns":["1520-5126"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1475668831,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jacs.6b08987"],"pmid":"27700071","pubdate":"2016-10-05T22:02:31+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Biosynthetic timing and substrate specificity for the thiopeptide thiomuracin ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biosynthetic-timing-substrate-specificity-thiopeptide-thiomuracin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7483631,"mean":6.488280441707,"rank":3855115,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2095180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7483631,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239586,"mean":12.52212372227,"rank":131329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":84068,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239586,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18001,"mean":5.0249588888889,"rank":12104,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":3817,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18001,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":501,"mean":7.42322,"rank":314,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":146,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":501,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
