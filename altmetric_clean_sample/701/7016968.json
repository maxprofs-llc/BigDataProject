However, there is considerable controversy in choosing appropriate methods to weigh the value of species and geographic regions. For example, the added value of phylogenetic conservation selection criteria remains disputed, as high correlations between them and the non-phylogenetic criteria of species richness have been reported. In this study we evaluate the commonly used conservation methods (species richness, endemism, phylogenetic diversity (PD) and phylogenetic endemism (PE)) in a case study on lemurs of Madagascar. This enables us to identify the conservation target of each method and discuss how they might be used in future conservation planning. Additionally, we introduce a novel metric which uses a phylogeny scaled according to the rate of phenotypic evolution, as a proxy for a species' ability to adapt to change. High rates of evolution can indicate generalization or specialization. Both specialization and low rates of evolution may result in an inability to adapt to changing environments. We studied conservation priorities by using the inverse of the rate of body mass evolution to account for species with low rates of evolution. In line with previous work we find high correlations among species richness and PD, and endemism and PE. Our results show that PE in combination with rates of evolution and their inverse prioritize grid cells containing highly endemic and specialized lemurs that are at risk of going extinct.
