This fundamentally limits their packing density. Here we report the use of nanophotonic cloaking to render neighbouring devices invisible to one another, which allows them to be placed closer together than is otherwise feasible. Specifically, we experimentally demonstrated waveguides that are spaced by a distance of \u223c\u03bb0\/2 and designed waveguides with centre-to-centre spacing as small as 600\u2009nm (<\u03bb0\/2.5). Our experiments show a transmission efficiency >-2\u2009dB and an extinction ratio >15\u2009dB over a bandwidth larger than 60\u2009nm. This performance can be improved with better design algorithms and industry-standard lithography. The nanophotonic cloak relies on multiple guided-mode resonances, which render such devices very robust to fabrication errors. Our devices are broadly complimentary-metal-oxide-semiconductor compatible, have a minimum pitch of 200\u2009nm and can be fabricated with a single lithography step. The nanophotonic cloaks can be generally applied to all passive integrated photonics.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Bing Shen","Randy Polson","Rajesh Menon"],"doi":"10.1038\/ncomms13126","first_seen_on":"2016-11-09T13:17:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","last_mentioned_on":1484603118,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/doi:10.1038\/ncomms13126","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/ncomms13126"],"pmid":"27827391","pubdate":"2016-11-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"13126","subjects":["science","biology"],"title":"Increasing the density of passive photonic-integrated circuits via nanophotonic cloaking","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increasing-density-passive-photonicintegrated-circuits-via-nanophotonic-cloaking"},"altmetric_score":{"score":144.25,"score_history":{"1y":144.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":144.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8076231,"mean":6.8570644748779,"rank":49989,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":8026238,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8076231,"percentile":99},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237579,"mean":13.17570807903,"rank":4009,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":233568,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237579,"percentile":98},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12556,"mean":43.925805017921,"rank":799,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":11757,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12556,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":894,"mean":61.009630459127,"rank":98,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":796,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":894,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
