The hybrids were antagonistic relative to the ciprofloxacin, but were substantially more potent than the parent kanamycin against Gram-negative bacteria, and overcame most dominant resistance mechanisms to aminoglycosides. Selected hybrids were 42-640 fold poorer inhibitors of bacterial protein synthesis than the parent kanamycin, while they displayed similar inhibitory activity to that of ciprofloxacin against DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV enzymes. The hybrids showed significant delay of resistance development in both E. coli and B. subtilis in comparison to that of component drugs alone or their 1:1 mixture. More generally, the data suggest that an antagonistic combination of aminoglycoside-fluoroquinolone hybrids can lead to new compounds that slowdown\/prevent the emergence of resistance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f1","authors":["Michal Shavit","Varvara Pokrovskaya","Valery Belakhov","Timor Baasov"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bmc.2017.02.068","first_seen_on":"2017-03-28T10:59:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["09680896","1464-3391"],"journal":"Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1490703899,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28343755?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28343755","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"title":"Covalently linked kanamycin \u2013 Ciprofloxacin hybrid antibiotics as a tool to fight bacterial resistance","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0968089617300913","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/covalently-linked-kanamycin-ciprofloxacin-hybrid-antibiotics-tool-fight-bacterial-resistance"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8425604,"mean":7.0878923279354,"rank":6393249,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1145048,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8425604,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248317,"mean":13.254478269624,"rank":178151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":42727,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248317,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1375,"mean":2.4013435225619,"rank":832,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":386,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1375,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":2.1159090909091,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
