The investigators interviewed patients with diabetes using an insulin pen or conventional vial\/syringe. A total of 74 questionnaires were filled over a period of 6 months. Answers were entered into the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software and Excel spreadsheet. t-test, logistic regression analysis, and correlation analysis were used in order to analyze the results.\nA higher percentage of patients from the insulin pen users group (95.2%) found the method easy to use as compared to only 46.7% of the insulin conventional users group (P 0.001, relative risk [RR]: 2.041, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.178-3.535). Moreover, 61.9% and 26.7% of pen users and conventional users, respectively, could read the scale easily (P 0.037, RR 2.321, 95% CI: 0.940-5.731), while 85.7% of pen users found it more convenient shifting to pen and 86.7% of the conventional users would want to shift to pen if it had the same cost. Pain perception was statistically different between the groups. A much higher percentage (76.2%) of pen users showed no pain during injection compared to only 26.7% of conventional users (P 0.003, RR 2.857, 95% CI: 1.194-6.838).\nThe insulin pen was significantly much easier to use and less painful than the conventional vial\/syringe. Proper education on the methods of administration\/storage and disposal of needles\/syringes is needed in both groups.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc71","authors":["Wijdan H Ramadan","Noura A Khreis","Wissam K Kabbara"],"doi":"10.2147\/ppa.s78225","first_seen_on":"2017-03-28T11:26:01+00:00","issns":["1177-889X"],"journal":"Patient preference and adherence","last_mentioned_on":1490684400,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4383149\/"],"pmid":"25848231","pubdate":"2017-03-28T20:15:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"517","title":"Simplicity, safety, and acceptability of insulin pen use versus the conventional vial\/syringe device in&nbsp;patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus in Lebanon","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/simplicity-safety-and-acceptability-of-insulin-pen-use-versus-the-conv-peer-reviewed-article-PPA","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/simplicity-safety-acceptability-insulin-pen-versus-conventional-vialsyringe-device-patients-type-1-t"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8425604,"mean":7.0878923279354,"rank":1236178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":7113373,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8425604,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248317,"mean":13.25451088935,"rank":54545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":191092,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248317,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":814,"mean":4.4838991389914,"rank":93,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":719,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":814,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":5.4585365853659,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":3,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":3}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":1,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Insulin pens: Types, benefits, and how to use them","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=30043102571&p=1pl&v=1&x=CqW1pIMThfBFpRt-0X4ogA","license":"public","citation_ids":[750562,18187954,18187955,18187956],"posted_on":"2017-03-28T07:00:00+00:00","summary":"Insulin pens are used by people with diabetes to inject insulin.
