Place conditioning procedures were utilized to compare the rewarding effects of nicotine (conditioned place preference; CPP) and negative affective states produced by withdrawal (conditioned place aversion; CPA) in vehicle- and STZ-treated rats. CPA and physical signs of withdrawal were compared after administration of the nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine to precipitate withdrawal in nicotine-dependent rats. A subsequent study utilized elevated plus maze (EPM) procedures to compare anxiety-like behavior produced by nicotine withdrawal in vehicle- and STZ-treated rats.\nSTZ-treated rats displayed greater rewarding effects of nicotine and a larger magnitude of aversive effects and physical signs produced by withdrawal as compared to vehicle-treated controls. STZ-treated rats also displayed higher levels of anxiety-like behavior on the EPM during nicotine withdrawal as compared to controls.\nThe finding that both nicotine reward and withdrawal are enhanced in a rodent model of diabetes implies that the strong behavioral effects of nicotine promote tobacco use in persons with metabolic disorders, such as diabetes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033ea","authors":["Joseph A.
