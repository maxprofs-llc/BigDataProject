Here, we describe the characterization of a prophage element designated pp3 in the clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolate PA1. pp3 spontaneously excises from the PA1 genome and circularizes at a very high frequency of 25%. pp3 is likely to be a defective prophage due to its inability to form plaques on P. aeruginosa indicator strains, and no phage particles could be detected in PA1 supernatants. The pp3-encoded integrase is essential for excision by mediating site-specific recombination at the 26-bp attachment sequence. Using a filter mating experiment, we demonstrated that pp3 can transfer into P. aeruginosa recipient strains that do not possess this element naturally. Upon transfer, pp3 integrates into the same attachment site as in PA1 and maintains the ability to excise and circularize. Furthermore, pp3 significantly promotes biofilm formation in the recipient. Sequence alignment reveals that the 26-bp attachment site recognized by pp3 is conserved in all P. aeruginosa strains sequenced to date, making it possible that pp3 could be extensively disseminated in P. aeruginosa. This work improves our understanding of the ways in which prophages influence bacterial behavior and evolution.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Li, Gang","Lu, Shuguang","Shen, Mengyu","Le, Shuai","Shen, Wei","Tan, Yinling","Wang, Jing","Zhao, Xia","Zhao, Yan","Gong, Yali","Yang, Yuhui","Zhu, Hongbin","Hu, Fuquan","Li, Ming","Gang Li","Shuguang Lu","Mengyu Shen","Shuai Le","Wei Shen","Yinling Tan","Jing Wang","Xia Zhao","Yan Zhao","Yali Gong","Yuhui Yang","Hongbin Zhu","Fuquan Hu","Ming Li"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0174429","first_seen_on":"2017-03-28T10:08:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"3","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1504001164,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28346467?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0174429"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0174429&type=printable","pmid":"28346467","pubdate":"2017-03-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science (PLoS)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0174429","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Characterization and interstrain transfer of prophage pp3 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterization-interstrain-transfer-prophage-pp3-pseudomonas-aeruginosa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":3673927,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4650932,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249019,"mean":13.260954428997,"rank":105454,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":139376,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249019,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116365,"mean":10.673805077172,"rank":49352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":64187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116365,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4616,"mean":10.594214951246,"rank":1912,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2603,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4616,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
