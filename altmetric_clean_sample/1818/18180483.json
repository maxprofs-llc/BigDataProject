The best k-t accelerated approach was further assessed in 10 patients with aortic disease.\nThe k-t accelerated in vitro aortic peak flow (Qmax), net flow (Qnet), and peak velocity (Vmax) were lower than conventional 4D flow indices by \u22644.7%,\u2009\u2264\u200911%, and \u226422%, respectively. In vivo k-t accelerated acquisitions were significantly shorter but showed a trend to lower image quality compared to conventional 4D flow. Hemodynamic indices for linear and out-center-out k-space samplings were in agreement with conventional 4D flow (Qmax\u2009\u2264\u200913%, Qnet\u2009\u2264\u200913%, Vmax\u2009\u2264\u200917%, P\u2009>\u20090.05).\nAortic 4D flow MRI in under 2 minutes is feasible with moderate underestimation of flow indices. Differences in k-space sampling patterns suggest an opportunity to mitigate image artifacts by an optimal trade-off between scan time, acceleration, and k-space sampling.
