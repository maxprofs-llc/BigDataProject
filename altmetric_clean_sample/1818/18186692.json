In the veterinary field, as in man, stem cells derived from extrafetal tissues express plasticity, reduced immunogenicity, and have high anti-inflammatory potential making them promising candidates for treatment of many diseases. Umbilical cord mesenchymal cells have been isolated and characterized in different species and have recently been investigated as potential candidates in regenerative medicine. In this study, cells derived from bovine Wharton jelly (WJ) were isolated for the first time by enzymatic methods, frozen\/thawed, cultivated for at least 10 passages, and characterized. Wharton jelly-derived cells readily attached to plastic culture dishes displaying typical fibroblast-like morphology and, although their proliferative capacity decreased to the seventh passage, these cells showed a mean doubling time of 34.55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.33\u00a0hours and a mean frequency of one colony-forming unit fibroblast like for every 221.68 plated cells. The results of molecular biology studies and flow cytometry analyses revealed that WJ-derived cells showed the typical antigen profile of mesenchymal stem cells and were positive for CD29, CD44, CD105, CD166, Oct-4, and c-Myc. They were negative for CD34 and CD14. Remarkably, WJ-derived cells showed differentiation ability. After culture in induced media, WJ-derived cells were able to differentiate into osteogenic, adipogenic, chondrogenic, and neurogenic lines as shown by positive staining and expression of specific markers. On polymerase chain reaction analysis, these cells were negative for MHC-II and positive for MHC-I, thus reinforcing the role of extrafetal tissue as an allogenic source for bovine cell-based therapies. These results provide evidence that bovine WJ-derived cells may have the potential to differentiate to repair damaged tissues and reinforce the importance of extrafetal tissues as stem cell sources in veterinary regenerative medicine. A more detailed evaluation of their immunologic properties is necessary to better understand their potential role in cellular therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f61000376c","authors":["Anna Lange-Consiglio","Claudia Perrini","Alessia Bertero","Paola Esposti","Fausto Cremonesi","Leila Vincenti"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.theriogenology.2016.09.042","first_seen_on":"2017-03-28T10:19:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0093691X","1879-3231"],"journal":"Theriogenology","last_mentioned_on":1490696225,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28341078?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28341078","pubdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Isolation, molecular characterization, and in\u00a0vitro differentiation of bovine Wharton jelly\u2013derived multipotent mesenchymal cells","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0093691X16304617","volume":"89","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/isolation-molecular-characterization-invitro-differentiation-bovine-wharton-jellyderived-multipotent-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8425604,"mean":7.0878923279354,"rank":7280551,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8425604,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248318,"mean":13.254446437416,"rank":205580,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248318,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1057,"mean":2.1373958333333,"rank":692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1057,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":1.2454054054054,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/StemDevelopment\/statuses\/846667452251463682","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18186692],"posted_on":"2017-03-28T10:17:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Stem Development","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/702323953503756289\/edzX6DGt_normal.jpg","description":"A glimpse at the latest research in Stem Cells, Regenerative Biology, Cell Fate Decisions, and Developmental Biology","id_on_source":"StemDevelopment","tweeter_id":"702322190369361920","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":24},"tweet_id":"846667452251463682"}]}}
