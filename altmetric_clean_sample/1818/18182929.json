Participants completed a survey containing the Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Data regarding demographics, alcohol and tobacco use, self-esteem, and family history of depression were also obtained. To identify associated factors, Poisson regression with robust variance was used. Prevalence ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated.\nOf the 875 adolescents, 55.8% were male. The mean age was 14.1\u00b11.5 years. Depressive symptoms were observed in 19.9% of participants. An association between BID and depressive symptoms was found. Alcohol and tobacco use were also associated with the outcome of interest.\nTeens who had BID were 3.7 times more likely to report depressive symptoms. Additionally, those who used tobacco or alcohol were 1.5 and 1.4 times more likely to have depressive symptoms, respectively. Further studies targeting other populations and using longitudinal designs are recommended.","authors":["Flores-Cornejo, Fiorela","Kamego-Tome, Mayumi","Zapata-Pachas, Mariana A.","Alvarado, German F."],"doi":"10.1590\/1516-4446-2016-1947","first_seen_on":"2017-03-28T07:25:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handle":"10757\/621303","handles":["10757\/621303"],"issns":["1809-452X","1516-4446"],"journal":"Revista Brasileira de Psiquiatria","last_mentioned_on":1497549330,"links":["http:\/\/www.scielo.br\/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1516-44462017005007101#.WNoP2ZLTi6A.twitter","http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/10757\/621303"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.scielo.br\/pdf\/rbp\/2017nahead\/1516-4446-rbp-1516444620161947.pdf","pmid":"28355343","pubdate":"2017-03-30T22:01:13+00:00","publisher":"Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Psiquiatria (ABP)","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Association between body image dissatisfaction and depressive symptoms in adolescents","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.scielo.br\/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1516-44462017005007101&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-between-body-image-dissatisfaction-depressive-symptoms-adolescents-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Professor":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Design":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"CO":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IFAC_Nantes\/statuses\/846624319681843201","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18182929],"posted_on":"2017-03-28T07:25:41+00:00","author":{"name":"IFAC CRJE","url":"http:\/\/www.ifac-addictions.fr","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1553161151\/Logo_IFAC_Twitter_normal.png","description":"Documentaliste Institut f\u00e9d\u00e9ratif des addictions comportementales Veille documentaire addictions comportementales","id_on_source":"IFAC_Nantes","tweeter_id":"164278199","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":819},"tweet_id":"846624319681843201"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Repositorio Acad\u00e9mico UPC","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1370806669706305&id=746845292102449","license":"public","citation_ids":[18182929],"posted_on":"2017-06-15T17:55:30+00:00","summary":"Association between body image dissatisfaction and depressive symptoms in adolescents Objective: To determine the association between body image dissatisfaction (BID) and depressive\nsymptoms in adolescents from a school \u2026CLIC EN EL ENLACE PARA VER EL TEXTO","author":{"name":"Repositorio Acad\u00e9mico UPC","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/746845292102449","facebook_wall_name":"Repositorio Acad\u00e9mico UPC","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/746845292102449\/picture","id_on_source":"746845292102449"}}]}}
