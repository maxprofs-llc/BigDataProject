Azolla, a symbiotic pteridophyte and potent candidate for biofertilizer due to its nitrogen fixation ability, shows reduced growth and nitrogen fixation during saline stress. To better understand regulatory components involved in salinity-induced physiological changes, in the present study, Azolla microphylla plants were exposed to NaCl (6.74 and 8.61\u00a0ds\/m) and growth, photochemical reactions of photosynthesis, ion accumulation, and changes in cellular proteome were studied. Maximum dry weight was accumulated in control and untreated plant while a substantial decrease in dry weight was observed in the plants exposed to salinity. Exposure of the organism to different concentrations of salt in hydroponic conditions resulted in differential level of Na(+) and K(+) ion accumulation. Comparative analysis of salinity-induced proteome changes in A. microphylla revealed 58 salt responsive proteins which were differentially expressed during the salt exposure. Moreover, 42\u00a0% spots among differentially expressed proteins were involved in different signaling events. The identified proteins are involved in photosynthesis, energy metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, protein synthesis, and defense. Downregulation of these key metabolic proteins appears to inhibit the growth of A. microphylla in response to salinity. Altogether, the study revealed that in Azolla, increased salinity primarily affected signaling and photosynthesis that in turn leads to reduced biomass.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033cc","authors":["Preeti Thagela","Ravindra Kumar Yadav","Vagish Mishra","Anil Dahuja","Altaf Ahmad","Pawan Kumar Singh","Budhi Sagar Tiwari","Gerard Abraham"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00709-016-0946-2","first_seen_on":"2017-03-28T10:19:19+00:00","issns":["0033-183X","1615-6102"],"journal":"Protoplasma","last_mentioned_on":1490696284,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26837223?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26837223","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Salinity-induced inhibition of growth in the aquatic pteridophyte Azolla microphylla primarily involves inhibition of photosynthetic components and signaling molecules as revealed by proteome analysis","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s00709-016-0946-2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/salinityinduced-inhibition-growth-aquatic-pteridophyte-azolla-microphylla-primarily-involves-inhibit"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8425604,"mean":7.0878923279354,"rank":6393245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1145062,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8425604,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248318,"mean":13.254446437416,"rank":178149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":42738,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248318,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":392,"mean":1.5486035805627,"rank":190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":138,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":392,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":1.695,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
