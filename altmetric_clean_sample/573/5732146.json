However, the subsequent addition of three new study sites was the greatest accelerator of enrollment (21 subjects\/mo), representing a 10-fold increase from baseline (p < 0.0001).\nIdentifying barriers to recruitment and implementing creative strategies to increase recruitment can successfully increase enrollment rates in the challenging ICU environment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008484","authors":["McBain, Kristin L","Payne, Eric T","Sharma, Rohit","Frndova, Helena","Abend, Nicholas S","S\u00e1nchez, Sarah M","Gallentine, William B","Cornett, Karen M","Nash, Kendall B","Snead, O Carter","Parshuram, Christopher S","Hutchison, Jamie S","Hahn, Cecil D","McBain, Kristin L.","Payne, Eric T.","Abend, Nicholas S.","S\u00e1nchez, Sarah M.","Gallentine, William B.","Cornett, Karen M.","Nash, Kendall B.","Snead, O.
