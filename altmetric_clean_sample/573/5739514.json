Assessments of PTSD, anxiety, depression, trait anger, locus of control, and disruptive behavior were conducted at baseline, posttreatment, and at 6-month follow-up.\nExperimental control across time (staggered start date) and setting (school and age) was demonstrated. Fourteen of 17 subjects completed treatment. Of these, 8 (57%) no longer met DSM-IV criteria for PTSD immediately after treatment; 12 (86%) of 14 were free of PTSD at 6-month follow-up. On intent-to-treat analyses, treatment produced a robust beneficial effect posttreatment on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale-Child and Adolescent Version, with additional improvement accruing at follow-up (p < .001). Improvements of a similar magnitude were seen for depression (p < .001), anxiety (p < .001), and anger (p < .005). Locus of control remained external from pre- to posttreatment but became strongly internal at follow-up (p < .001).\nMore clinical trials are required to confirm that CBT is a safe, acceptable, and effective treatment for PTSD in children and adolescents.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f53","authors":["March, J S","Amaya-Jackson, L","Murray, M C","Schulte, A","JOHN S.
