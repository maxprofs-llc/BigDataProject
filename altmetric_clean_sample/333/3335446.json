To gain additional insights into the relationships between alpha-Syn expression and cell death, we examined the effects of expressing human alpha-Syn (Hualpha-Syn) variants on the cellular vulnerability to apoptotic stimuli. We show that the expression of wild-type (WT) and A30P mutant, but not A53T mutant, Hualpha-Syn leads to the protection of neuronal cell lines from apoptosis but not necrosis. Significantly, Hualpha-Syn did not protect non-neuronal cell lines from apoptosis. We also show that A53T mutant is a loss of function in regards to the antiapoptotic property since the expression of WT Hualpha-Syn with an excess of A53T mutant Hualpha-Syn leads to protection of the cells from apoptosis. The antiapoptotic property is specific to human alpha-Syn as neither beta-Syn nor mouse alpha-Syn protected cells from apoptosis, and the carboxy-terminal 20 amino acids are required for the antiapoptotic property. Analyses of capase-3 and caspase-9 activation reveal that the antiapoptotic property of Hualpha-Syn in neuronal cell lines is associated with the attenuation of caspase-3 activity without affecting the caspase-9 activity or the levels of cleaved, active caspase-3. We conclude that Hualpha-Syn modulates the activity of cleaved caspase-3 product in neuronal cell lines.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e72","authors":["Li, Wenxue","Lee, Michael K."],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1471-4159.2005.03146.x","first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T09:45:24+00:00","issns":["1471-4159"],"journal":"Journal of Neurochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1343493576,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1471-4159.2005.03146.x","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15935070"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1471-4159.2005.03146.x\/pdf","pmid":"15935070","pubdate":"2005-04-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Science Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["chemistry","neurology"],"title":"Antiapoptotic property of human alpha-synuclein in neuronal cell lines is associated with the inhibition of caspase-3 but not caspase-9 activity.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antiapoptotic-property-human-%CE%B1synuclein-neuronal-cell-lines-associated-inhibition-caspase3-not-caspa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628758,"mean":4.9386506288559,"rank":816794,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2289082,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628758,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93841,"mean":8.0815194586532,"rank":24299,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68463,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93841,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1755,"mean":2.1783808437856,"rank":137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":858,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1755,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":1.03125,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
