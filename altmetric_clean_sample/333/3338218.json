Furthermore, RNA editing alters leader, trailer and intron sequences, and may be required for processing of these sequences. For several plant mitochondrial transcripts, processing includes trans splicing, which connects exons scattered throughout the genome. The mature transcripts are assembled via split group II intron sequences.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036ad","authors":["B Wissinger","A Brennicke","W Schuster"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T10:58:11+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0168-9525"],"issue":"9","journal":"Trends in Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1397586350,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1365399"],"pmid":"1365399","pubdate":"1992-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Regenerating good sense: RNA editing and trans splicing in plant mitochondria.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/regenerating-good-sense-rna-editing-trans-splicing-plant-mitochondria"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3661375,"mean":4.9443976578233,"rank":826697,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2310852,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3661375,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98229,"mean":8.459423870994,"rank":26661,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":70448,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98229,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":734,"mean":5.4497598908595,"rank":275,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":734,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":6.4,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
