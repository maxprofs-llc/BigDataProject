Their care workers completed questionnaires on ACEs.ResultsStructural equation modeling (SEM) was created and the goodness of fit was examined (CMIN\u00bf=\u00bf129.223, df\u00bf=\u00bf1.360, GFI\u00bf=\u00bf.959, AGFI\u00bf=\u00bf.936, CFI\u00bf=\u00bf.939, RMSEA\u00bf=\u00bf.033). Maltreatment negatively predicted scores on secure attachment, but positively predicted scores on avoidant and ambivalent attachment. The secure attachment score negatively predicted depressive symptoms. The ambivalent attachment score positively predicted depressive symptoms both directly and through self-esteem, whereas the avoidant attachment score positively predicted depressive symptoms only directly. Maltreatment neither directly predicts self-esteem nor depressive symptoms, and parental illness\/death and parental sociopathic behaviors did not predict any variables.ConclusionsResults show that the adversity of child maltreatment affects depression through attachment styles and low self-esteem among institutionalized children. Implications of child maltreatment and recommendations for child welfare services and clinical interventions for institutionalized children are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d7","authors":["Hanako Suzuki","Akemi Tomoda"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12888-015-0385-1","first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T00:10:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-244X"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1428527347,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-244X\/15\/8\/abstract","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-244X\/15\/8"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/s12888-015-0385-1.pdf","pmid":"25651759","pubdate":"2015-02-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"8","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Roles of attachment and self-esteem: impact of early life stress on depressive symptoms among Japanese institutionalized children","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/roles-attachment-selfesteem-impact-early-life-stress-depressive-symptoms-among-japanese-institutiona"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":2081908,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":2872710,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178719,"mean":8.6485188061638,"rank":66586,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":108460,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178719,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1626,"mean":5.6740935384615,"rank":882,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":688,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1626,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":6.8553783783784,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
