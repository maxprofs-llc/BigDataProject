The most established mTOR inhibitors--rapamycin and its derivatives--showed long-lasting objective tumour responses in clinical trials, with CCI-779 being a first-in-class mTOR inhibitor that improved the survival of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. This heralded the beginning of extensive clinical programmes to further evaluate mTOR inhibitors in several tumour types. Here we review the clinical development of this drug class and look at future prospects for incorporating these agents into multitarget or multimodality strategies against cancer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f610003169","authors":["Sandrine Faivre","Guido Kroemer","Eric Raymond","Faivre S","Kroemer G","Raymond E"],"doi":"10.1038\/nrd2062","endpage":"688","first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T11:03:18+00:00","issns":["1474-1776","1474-1784"],"issue":"8","journal":"Nature Reviews Drug Discovery","last_mentioned_on":1348667237,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nrd\/journal\/v5\/n8\/full\/nrd2062.html","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/nrd2062","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16883305","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/Nrd2062","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16883305"],"pmid":"16883305","pubdate":"2006-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"671","subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Current development of mTOR inhibitors as anticancer agents","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/current-development-mtor-inhibitors-anticancer-agents-6"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3992024,"mean":5.0370515321327,"rank":917487,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2528536,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3992024,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124128,"mean":9.0117620927462,"rank":37423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":85059,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124128,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1226,"mean":7.5029779591837,"rank":571,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":570,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1226,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":17.69431372549,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":11,"Researcher":49,"Student  > Ph.
