However, few studies have explored the significance of service user and practitioner understandings. Aims: The study explored the experiences of service users, practitioners and nearest relatives, to identify key factors and good practice in relation to CTOs. Method: A study of CTOs in a mental health NHS Trust in Southern England, including 72 semi-structured interviews, analysed thematically. Results: CTOs were perceived as helpful in certain circumstances for the \"right\" service user. Factors influencing effectiveness included recognition of the containing elements of the CTO, a respect for its legal authority and an acceptance of conditions. Conclusions: The perceptions of service users have an important role in determining the value and potential effectiveness of CTOs. A consideration of these issues should be integral to the process of assessing whether a CTO is appropriate in individual cases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610004056","authors":["Julia Stroud","Laura Banks","Karolina Doughty"],"doi":"10.3109\/09638237.2014.998809","endpage":"5","first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T22:51:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0963-8237","1360-0567"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Mental Health","last_mentioned_on":1472515200,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/full\/10.3109\/09638237.2014.998809","http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/09638237.2014.998809","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/eprint\/hSjjUT2VqVTCfB58nfKr\/full","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3109\/09638237.2014.998809"],"pmid":"25642950","pubdate":"2015-02-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["psychiatry","psychology"],"title":"Community treatment orders: learning from experiences of service users, practitioners and nearest relatives","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.3109\/09638237.2014.998809","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/community-treatment-orders-learning-experiences-service-users-practitioners-nearest-relatives"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8296164,"mean":6.9911317525872,"rank":705281,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7577714,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8296164,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241152,"mean":8.2888822190245,"rank":25989,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":214844,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241152,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":444,"mean":4.895164785553,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":406,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":444,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":6.175,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
