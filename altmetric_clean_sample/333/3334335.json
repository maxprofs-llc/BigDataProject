Bronchoscopic intervention is a minimally invasive treatment, but incomplete resection or recurrence has been reported. We report a case of a 76-year-old woman with a tracheal tumor of 14 mm in diameter incidentally detected on chest computed tomography. Bronchoscopic examination revealed a smooth polypoid tumor which pedunculated from the left side of the cartilaginous tracheal wall. An endobronchial electrocautery snare with flexible bronchoscope was successfully used under general anesthesia and with intubation. The resected specimen was pathologically consistent with leiomyoma. Bronchoscopic intervention can yield successful treatment of pedunculated tracheobronchial leiomyomas, although surgical resection should also be considered in cases of broad-based or iceberg-type leiomyomas because of the risk of incomplete resection or recurrence.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bab","authors":["Nakamura Y","Hata Y","Koezuka S","Makino
