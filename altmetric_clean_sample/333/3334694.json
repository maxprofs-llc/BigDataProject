To answer this question, we developed a supervised machine-learning method to correctly discriminate 15 preschool children with ASD from 15 typically developing children by means of kinematic analysis of a simple reach-to-drop task. Our method reached a maximum classification accuracy of 96.7\u00a0% with seven features related to the goal-oriented part of the movement. These preliminary findings offer insight into a possible motor signature of ASD that may be potentially useful in identifying a well-defined subset of patients, reducing the clinical heterogeneity within the broad behavioral phenotype.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cb4","authors":["Alessandro Crippa","Christian Salvatore","Paolo Perego","Sara Forti","Maria Nobile","Massimo Molteni","Isabella Castiglioni"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10803-015-2379-8","first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T06:50:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-3432","0162-3257"],"journal":"Journal of Autism & Developmental Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1423238505,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10803-015-2379-8","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25652603"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10803-015-2379-8.pdf","pmid":"25652603","pubdate":"2015-02-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Child and School Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pediatrics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry","pediatrics"],"title":"Use of Machine Learning to Identify Children with Autism and Their Motor Abnormalities.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/machine-learning-identify-children-autism-motor-abnormalities"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4723481,"mean":5.6986316415034,"rank":1027866,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":3685292,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4723481,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164736,"mean":8.7738271284187,"rank":43172,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":121065,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164736,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1720,"mean":7.8149377545084,"rank":775,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":944,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1720,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":9.5144923076923,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
