MITA will enable State Medicaid agencies to align their information technology (IT) opportunities with their evolving business needs. It also addresses long-standing issues of interoperability, adaptability, and data sharing, including clinical data, across organizational boundaries by creating models based on nationally accepted technical standards. Perhaps most significantly, MITA allows State Medicaid Programs to actively participate in the DHHS Secretary's vision of a transparent health care market that utilizes electronic health records (EHRs), ePrescribing and personal health records (PHRs).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5623cf058f610004998","authors":["Friedman RH"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T22:21:45+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"2","journal":"Health Care Financing Review","last_mentioned_on":1224505732,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17427840","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4194978"],"pmid":"17427840","pubdate":"2007-04-13T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["healthservices"],"title":"Medicaid Information Technology Architecture: An Overview","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/medicaid-information-technology-architecture-overview"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627387,"mean":4.9489064262842,"rank":817681,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2286359,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627387,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93693,"mean":8.0229690902106,"rank":24217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68394,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93693,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":5.8256363636364,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
