The demonstration that this was not the case, but that both plants and animals possess accurate endogenous time-measuring machinery (i.e., circadian clocks) contributed to heightening interest in the study of circadian biological rhythms. In the last few decades, flourishing studies have demonstrated that most organisms have at least one internal circadian timekeeping device that oscillates with a period close to that of the astronomical day (i.e., 24h). To date, many of the physiological mechanisms underlying the control of circadian rhythmicity have been described, while the improvement of molecular biology techniques has permitted extraordinary advancements in our knowledge of the molecular components involved in the machinery underlying the functioning of circadian clocks in many different organisms, man included. In this review, we attempt to summarize our current understanding of the genetic and molecular biology of circadian clocks in cyanobacteria, fungi, insects, and mammals.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5213cf058f610003a6e","authors":["M Zordan","R Costa","G Macino","C Fukuhara","G Tosini"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T23:40:56+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0742-0528"],"issue":"4","journal":"Chronobiology International: The Journal of Biological & Medical Rhythm Research","last_mentioned_on":1302669440,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10908122"],"pmid":"10908122","pubdate":"2000-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Circadian clocks: what makes them tick?","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/circadian-clocks-makes-them-tick"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627387,"mean":4.9489064262842,"rank":817685,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2286349,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627387,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93692,"mean":8.022855130162,"rank":24215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93692,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":367,"mean":4.8705628415301,"rank":91,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":224,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":367,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":7,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
