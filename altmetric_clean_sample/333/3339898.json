Since rodent studies have demonstrated that mouse insulin-producing cells do not proliferate in vitro, a similar possibility has been considered for human islet endocrine cells. Considering the inherent differences in mouse and human pancreatic islets, we decided to assess the potential of human fetal pancreatic insulin-producing cells to proliferate in vitro. We studied the proliferative potential of human fetal pancreatic islet-derived populations from second or third trimester fetal pancreas and characterized the cells that grow out during their expansion. We have used seven different approaches including in situ hybridization and immunostaining, quantitative estimation of multiple gene transcripts in populations as well as in single cells, clonal analysis of islet cells, assessment of heritable marks of active insulin promoter, and thymidine analog-based lineage tracing. Our studies demonstrate that human fetal pancreatic insulin-producing cells proliferate in vitro to generate mesenchymal cell populations. Interestingly, epigenetic modifications that mark open chromatin conformation of insulin promoter regions are retained even after a million fold expansion\/proliferation in vitro. These findings demonstrate that hormone-producing cells in pancreatic islets proliferate in vitro and retain epigenetic marks that characterize an active insulin promoter. Such in vitro-derived mesenchymal cells may be of potential use in cell-replacement therapy for diabetes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d78","authors":["Mugdha V Joglekar","Vinay M Joglekar","Sheela V Joglekar","Anandwardhan A Hardikar","Joglekar MV","Joglekar VM","Joglekar SV","Hardikar AA"],"doi":"10.1677\/joe-08-0497","first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T11:48:29+00:00","issns":["1479-6805","0022-0795"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1397932517,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1677\/joe-08-0497"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/joe.endocrinology-journals.org\/content\/201\/1\/27.full.pdf","pmid":"19171567","pubdate":"2009-04-14T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Human fetal pancreatic insulin-producing cells proliferate in vitro","type":"article","volume":"201","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/human-fetal-pancreatic-insulinproducing-cells-proliferate-vitro"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3671668,"mean":4.9522324780583,"rank":829908,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2317782,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3671668,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99366,"mean":8.5488416444423,"rank":27293,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":70951,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99366,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":454,"mean":2.5660353200883,"rank":66,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":289,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":454,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":4.0771428571429,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
