However, TMEM230 has not yet been investigated in the most common neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we demonstrate that the expression of TMEM230 is specifically increased in neurons in AD patients. Importantly, both granulovacuolar degeneration (GVD) and dystrophic neurites (DNs), two prominent characteristic pathological structures associated with AD, contain TMEM230 aggregates. TMEM230 immunoreactivity can be detected in neurofibrillary tangles-containing neurons and hyperphosphorylated tau positive DNs. TMEM230 accumulation is also noted around senile plaques. These findings identifying TMEM230 as a component of GVD and DNs suggest TMEM230 dysregulation as a likely mechanism playing an important role in the pathogenesis of AD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c7a","authors":["Siedlak, Sandra L.","Jiang, Yingfei","Huntley, Mikayla L.","Wang, Luwen","Gao, Ju","Xie, Fei","Liu, Jingyi","Su, Bo","Perry, George","Wang, Xinglong","Sandra L.
