The result were compared with that in the control group. The anti-schistosomiasis knowledge level among the three kinds of population improved significantly, the correct rate of attitude to examination and chemotherapy among pupils and adult men and the correct rate of anti-schistosomiasis value concept among women were raised greatly, obedience to examination and chemotherapy among adult men increased, the rate of infested water exposure and infection rate among pupils and adult women declined remarkably.
