Antihypertensive drugs modify serum uric acid levels, however, few data are available about their combinations on uricemia. In this study we evaluate the effect of two combinations of losartan, with amlodipine or with hydrochlorothiazide, on serum uric acid levels in hypertensive patients.\nA total of 60 hypertensive patients were randomized in two groups; group LA received losartan\/amlodipine (100\/5 mg) once a day, whereas LH group received losartan hydrochlorothiazide (100\/12.5 mg) once a day for 3 months. In both groups serum uric acid levels were measured at the beginning and end of the study. Patients were evaluated monthly for blood pressure (BP) and adverse events. Statistical analysis was performed with a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures.\nAll patients experienced a significant reduction of BP to the same extent (LA 155\/94 to 123\/79, LH 157\/92 to 124\/78 mmHg, p > 0.05). In the LA group, serum uric acid decreased from 6.5 \u00b1 1.6 to 4.6 \u00b1 1.3 mg\/ml (p = 0.0001), whereas in the LH group there was a nonsignificant increase from 5.82 \u00b1 1.4 to 5.85 \u00b1 1.5 mg\/ml, (p = 0.936). When both groups were compared, we found a significant reduction (p < 0.00013) on serum uric acid levels in the LA group.\nBoth combinations decrease BP values to the same extent, however, LA combination showed a reduction on serum uric acid levels, which may contribute to a reduction in the metabolic risk in hypertensive patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008b51","authors":["Alberto F.
