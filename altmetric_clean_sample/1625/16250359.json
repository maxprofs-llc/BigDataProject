Recently published WHO guidelines recommend use of deinfibulation in both circumstances. However, to really impact practice, evidence-based guidance needs to be matched with evidence-based implementation strategies. This qualitative evidence synthesis provides information on the factors that facilitate or act as barriers to use of deinfibulation, and the context and conditions that are necessary for implementing the procedure, including healthcare providers' knowledge and experience, the service delivery environment, as well as broader health system contexts. This information is of great value for policy makers and others considering this as an option for better clinical care of women living with FGM.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b55","authors":["Smith, Helen","Stein, Karin"],"doi":"10.1002\/ijgo.12053","endpage":"46","first_seen_on":"2017-02-09T07:38:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00207292","1879-3479"],"issue":"S1","journal":"International Journal of Gynecology & Obstetrics","last_mentioned_on":1486406996,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/ijgo.12053","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ijgo.12053\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ijgo.12053\/pdf","pmid":"28164291","pubdate":"2017-02-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"43","subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Surgical or medical interventions for female genital mutilation","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/ijgo.12053","volume":"136 Suppl 1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/surgical-medical-interventions-female-genital-mutilation-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8170298,"mean":6.9145785001388,"rank":1172862,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6923188,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8170298,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":264322,"mean":12.861943795612,"rank":57926,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":202930,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":264322,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1774,"mean":3.8674416243655,"rank":144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":1619,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1774,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":4.5365853658537,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"What are the best treatments for female genital mutilation?","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=29491043104&p=1pl&v=1&x=A_kfSVH1ol7oA9Up2t_TBg","license":"public","citation_ids":[16174077,16170428,16250358,16250359],"posted_on":"2017-02-06T18:49:56+00:00","summary":"A new review provides valuable insights for improving the health care of girls and women living with female genital mutilation.","author":{"name":"MedicalXpress","url":"http:\/\/medicalxpress.com\/","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/000\/152\/normal\/image.png?1369925783"}}]}}
