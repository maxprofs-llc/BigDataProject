Mean national food prices for 57 foods were used to estimate diet costs.\nDiets high in fat, sugar, and grains were associated with lower diet costs after adjustment for energy intakes, gender, and age. For most levels of energy intake, each additional 100 g of fats and sweets was associated with a 0.05-0.40 per day reduction in diet costs. In contrast, each additional 100 g of fruit and vegetables was associated with a 0.18-0.29 per day increase in diet costs.\nDiets high in fats and sweets represent a low-cost option to the consumer, whereas the recommended \"prudent\" diets cost more.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000221a","authors":["Adam Drewnowski","Nicole Darmon","Andr\u00e9 Briend"],"first_seen_on":"2017-02-09T10:06:17+00:00","issns":["0090-0036"],"issue":"9","journal":"American Journal of Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1486634760,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1448493\/"],"pmcid":"PMC1448493","pmid":"15333314","pubdate":"2004-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Public Health Association","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1555","subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Replacing fats and sweets with vegetables and fruits--a question of cost.","type":"article","volume":"94","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/replacing-fats-sweets-vegetables-fruits-question-cost"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454259,"mean":7.1045520782463,"rank":4518047,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2355309,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454259,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282871,"mean":12.570965835896,"rank":159518,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":95047,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282871,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8983,"mean":15.436273213093,"rank":7670,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":817,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8983,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123,"mean":45.23731147541,"rank":106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":21,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
