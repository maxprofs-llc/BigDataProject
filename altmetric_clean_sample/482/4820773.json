Treatment of an acute episode of back pain includes relative rest, activity modification, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, and physical therapy. Patient education is also imperative, as these patients are at risk for further future episodes of back pain. Chronic back pain (>6\u00a0months' duration) develops in a small percentage of patients. Clinicians' ability to diagnose the exact pathologic source of these symptoms is severely limited, making a cure unlikely. Treatment of these patients should be supportive, the goal being to improve pain and function.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b19","authors":["Patrick, Nathan","Emanski, Eric","Knaub, Mark A","Nathan Patrick","Eric Emanski","Mark A.
