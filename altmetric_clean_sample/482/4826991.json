Indeed, ~ 40% of patients in vegetative state (VS) are misdiagnosed, suggesting the need of more appropriate diagnostic tools. Emerging data are showing that EEG, including sleep structure evaluation and multimodal evoked potential recording could be helpful in DOC diagnosis. Moreover, pain perception evaluation could further increase diagnosis accuracy in such individuals.\nFourteen individuals with DOC, due to severe brain injury, were enrolled and admitted to the Intensive Neurorehabilitation Unit of the Research Institute. All patients were evaluated by means of the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised, a 24(hh)-polysomnography and a Laser Evoked Potential (LEP) paradigm.\nClinically-defined patients in Minimally Consciousness State showed a more preserved sleep structure, physiologic hypnic figures and preserved REM\/NREM sleep distribution than subjects in VS. LEP showed increased latencies and reduced amplitudes and were also detectable in patients with more structured sleep.\nThe data support previous findings concerning the importance of sleep study in DOC diagnosis, with more specific neurophysiological paradigms. Interestingly, the findings shed some light on the possible correlations among global brain connectivity, sleep structure and pain perception, which are related to the activity of the wide thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical networks underlying consciousness.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51f3cf058f6100039eb","authors":["Aric\u00f2, Irene","Naro, Antonino","Pisani, Laura Rosa","Leo, Antonino","Muscar\u00e0, Nunzio","Salvo, Simona De","Silvestri, Rosalia","Bramanti, Placido","Calabr\u00f2, Rocco Salvatore"],"doi":"10.3109\/02699052.2015.1089595","first_seen_on":"2015-12-01T12:02:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1362-301X"],"journal":"Brain Injury","last_mentioned_on":1448971353,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26618404?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26618404","pubdate":"2015-12-01T22:00:24+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["brain"],"title":"Could combined sleep and pain evaluation be useful in the diagnosis of disorders of consciousness (DOC)?
