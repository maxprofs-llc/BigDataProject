One MYB member, CmMYB6, has been verified as a transcription regulator of chrysanthemum genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis; however, the co-regulators for CmMYB6 remain unclear in chrysanthemum. Here, the expression pattern of CmbHLH2, which is clustered in the IIIf bHLH subgroup, was shown to be positively correlated with the anthocyanin content of cultivars with red, pink and yellow flower colors, respectively. CmbHLH2 significantly upregulated the CmDFR promoter and triggered anthocyanin accumulation when co-expressed with CmMYB6. Yeast one-hybrid analyses indicated that CmbHLH2 was able to bind directly to the CmDFR promoter. Moreover, yeast two-hybrid assays indicated protein-protein interaction between CmbHLH2 and CmMYB6. These results suggest that CmbHLH2 is the essential partner for CmMYB6 in regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis in chrysanthemum.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Li-li Xiang","Xiao-fen Liu","Xue Li","Xue-ren Yin","Donald Grierson","Fang Li","Kun-song Chen"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0143892","first_seen_on":"2015-12-01T01:38:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"11","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1448996428,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0143892","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26619181?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0143892.PDF","pmid":"26619181","pubdate":"2015-11-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0143892","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"A Novel bHLH Transcription Factor Involved in Regulating Anthocyanin Biosynthesis in Chrysanthemums (Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat.).","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-bhlh-transcription-factor-involved-regulating-anthocyanin-biosynthesis-chrysanthemums-chrysant"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6632903,"mean":6.1476115477016,"rank":3160466,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1980566,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6632903,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252577,"mean":9.1918413230074,"rank":132620,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":93057,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252577,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100492,"mean":9.8819975321176,"rank":57856,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":31909,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100492,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4917,"mean":10.455063059398,"rank":2888,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1609,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4917,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
