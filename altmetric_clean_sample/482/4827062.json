The authors present the case of an unusual clinical course in which there were 3 distinct episodes of recurrence, each time presenting predominantly as fecal incontinence and resolving with operative intervention. Typical signs of tethering were absent on radiological evaluation, and operative intervention was based on clinical grounds. Intraoperatively, sacral nerve roots to the anal sphincter were found tethered to the filar stump with electrophysiological evidence of regained activity on disentanglement. To the best of the authors' knowledge, a similar clinical course or operative findings have not been reported.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d99","authors":["Jose Behaine"],"doi":"10.3171\/2015.5.peds15124","first_seen_on":"2015-12-01T12:21:32+00:00","issns":["1933-0715"],"journal":"Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics","last_mentioned_on":1448972477,"links":["http:\/\/thejns.org\/doi\/abs\/10.3171\/2015.5.PEDS15124?ai=3f6&mi=3bc4wj&af=R"],"pmid":"26382183","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurosurgery","pediatrics"],"title":"Fecal incontinence as a predominant symptom in a case of multiply recurrent tethered cord: diagnosis and operative strategies","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fecal-incontinence-predominant-symptom-case-multiply-recurrent-tethered-cord-diagnosis-operative-str"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6632903,"mean":6.1476115477016,"rank":5659597,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6632903,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252578,"mean":9.1918146307856,"rank":200068,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252578,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":537,"mean":7.2052686567164,"rank":342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":537,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":7.2761538461538,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Other":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/671665368268537857","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4827062],"posted_on":"2015-12-01T12:21:17+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":981},"tweet_id":"671665368268537857"}]}}
