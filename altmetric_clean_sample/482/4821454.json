However, the results were conflicting. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to confirm the effect of the TLR2 Arg753Gln polymorphism on sepsis risk.\nRelevant records up to 1 June 2015 were retrieved from the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Knowledge databases. The odds ratios with their corresponding 95\u00a0% confidence intervals were used to assess the association between the TLR2 Arg753Gln polymorphism and sepsis risk. The selection of a fixed or random effects model was made according to a heterogeneity test in total and subgroup analyses. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias test were performed to ensure the reliability of our results.\nA total of 12 studies with aggregate totals of 898 cases and 1517 controls met our inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. There were significant associations between the TLR2 Arg753Gln polymorphism and sepsis risk in overall analyses under two genetic models (the allele comparison and the dominant model). In addition, subgroup analyses based on age group, ethnicity, sepsis type, and source of control also showed a significant effect of the TLR2 Arg753Gln polymorphism on sepsis risk.\nOur present meta-analysis supports a direct effect of the TLR2 Arg753Gln polymorphism on sepsis risk, especially in Europeans. The TLR2 Arg753Gln polymorphism might be used as a relevant risk estimate for the development of sepsis. Studies with larger sample sizes and homogeneous groups of patients with sepsis are required for further analysis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000805","authors":["Jun-wei Gao","An-qiang Zhang","Xiao Wang","Zhong-yun Li","Jian-hua Yang","Ling Zeng","Wei Gu","Jian-xin Jiang"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13054-015-1130-3","first_seen_on":"2015-11-30T03:49:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1364-8535","1466-609X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Critical Care","last_mentioned_on":1450019840,"links":["http:\/\/www.ccforum.com\/content\/19\/1\/416?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ccforum.com\/content\/19\/1\/416"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ccforum.com\/content\/pdf\/s13054-015-1130-3.pdf","pmid":"26616674","pubdate":"2015-11-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Emergency Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Intensive \/ Critical Care Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"416","subjects":["criticalcare"],"title":"Association between the TLR2 Arg753Gln polymorphism and the risk of sepsis: a meta-analysis","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-between-tlr2-arg753gln-polymorphism-risk-sepsis-metaanalysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6743544,"mean":6.1672983391654,"rank":1548305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":5178792,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6743544,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279387,"mean":8.5962482873157,"rank":77003,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":201224,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279387,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3024,"mean":9.617769765134,"rank":1461,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":1550,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3024,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122,"mean":21.028512396694,"rank":103,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
