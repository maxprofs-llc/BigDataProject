The clinical features of these patients were also recorded.\nThirty-seven COL1A1 and COL1A2 mutations were identified, including 28 COL1A1 mutations and 9 COL1A2 mutations. Fifteen (41\u00a0%) were novel mutations, and twelve (32\u00a0%) were familial mutations. A review of their medical records revealed that the 72 patients could be classified into OI type I (n\u2009=\u200942), III (n\u2009=\u20095), and IV (n\u2009=\u200925). Twenty-nine patients had helical mutations (caused by the substitution of a glycine within the Gly-X-Y triplet domain of the triple helix), and 42 had haploinsufficiency mutations (caused by frameshift, nonsense, and splice-site mutations). Compared with haploinsufficiency, the patients with helical mutations had more severely impaired skeletal phenotypes, including shorter height, lower bone mineral density, poorer walking ability, more frequent manifestations of dentinogenesis imperfecta and scoliosis (p\u2009<\u20090.05).\nGenotype and phenotype databases are expected to promote better genetic counseling and medical care of patients with OI.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000087f","authors":["Hsiang-Yu Lin","Chih-Kuang Chuang","Yi-Ning Su","Ming-Ren Chen","Hui-Chin Chiu","Dau-Ming Niu","Shuan-Pei Lin"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13023-015-0370-2","first_seen_on":"2015-12-01T07:54:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1750-1172"],"issue":"1","journal":"Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1448959433,"links":["http:\/\/www.ojrd.com\/content\/10\/1\/152?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ojrd.com\/content\/pdf\/s13023-015-0370-2.pdf","pmcid":"PMC4666204","pmid":"26627451","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Genetics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology\/Toxicology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"152","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Genotype and phenotype analysis of Taiwanese patients with osteogenesis imperfecta","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genotype-phenotype-analysis-taiwanese-patients-osteogenesis-imperfecta"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6632903,"mean":6.1476115477016,"rank":4663370,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1725797,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6632903,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252576,"mean":9.1918763298028,"rank":159692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":80647,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252576,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":982,"mean":4.3004464831804,"rank":729,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":164,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":982,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":4.1786470588235,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":4,"Student  > Bachelor":4,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":11,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":4,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IN":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/whatDNAtest\/statuses\/671598139795570689","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4825897],"posted_on":"2015-12-01T07:54:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Carlos Esteban PhD","url":"http:\/\/whatdnatest.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2209463838\/c-azul-negro2_normal.jpg","description":"News and comments on #genetics, #genomics, #RareDiseases and DNA testing.
