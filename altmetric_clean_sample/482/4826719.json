In the current study, we investigated the metabolic and therapeutic effects of resveratrol in vivo.\nA fluorescent xenograft mouse model of ovarian cancer was used. Mice were treated with cisplatin, resveratrol, or vehicle alone. Tumor burden was assessed using whole-body imaging. The effect of resveratrol on glucose uptake in vivo was determined using micro-positron emission tomography scanning. To determine whether resveratrol could inhibit tumor regrowth, tumor-bearing mice were treated with cisplatin followed by either daily resveratrol or vehicle. Autophagic response in resected tumors taken from mice treated with resveratrol was examined by transmission electron microscopy. Glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration in ovarian tumor cells after treatment with resveratrol was assessed.\nMice treated with resveratrol and cisplatin were found to have a significantly reduced tumor burden compared with control animals (P<.001). Resveratrol-treated mice demonstrated a marked decrease in tumor uptake of glucose compared with controls. After treatment with cisplatin, \"maintenance\" resveratrol resulted in the suppression of tumor regrowth compared with mice receiving vehicle alone (P<.01). Tumors resected from mice treated with resveratrol exhibited autophagosomes consistent with the induction of autophagy. Treatment with resveratrol inhibited glycolytic response in ovarian tumor cells with high baseline glycolytic rates.\nTreatment with resveratrol inhibits glucose uptake and has a significant antineoplastic effect in a preclinical mouse model of ovarian cancer. Resveratrol treatment suppresses tumor regrowth after therapy with cisplatin, suggesting that this agent has the potential to prolong disease-free survival.
