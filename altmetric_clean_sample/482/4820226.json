Common mutations reported to be found within this subtype include KRAS and BRAF.\nUsing clinical information of patients from our IRB-approved registry and tissue from a subset of these patients, we performed mutational analysis for KRAS and BRAF using the direct Sanger sequencing technique and correlated findings with the clinical outcome, overall survival (OS).\nIn 79 cases, patients with KRAS or BRAF mutations (n=21) had a significantly better OS than those with wild-type KRAS or BRAF (n=58) (106.7 months (95% CI, 50.6, 162.9) vs 66.8 months (95% CI, 43.6, 90.0)), respectively (P=0.018).\nMutational status appears to be a potential prognostic factor in low-grade serous carcinoma of the ovary or peritoneum.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication 20 October 2015; doi:10.1038\/bjc.2015.364 www.bjcancer.com.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000243d","authors":["David M Gershenson","Charlotte C Sun","Kwong-Kwok Wong","Gershenson, David M","Sun, Charlotte C","Wong, Kwong-Kwok"],"doi":"10.1038\/bjc.2015.364","endpage":"1258","first_seen_on":"2015-11-29T19:41:34+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1532-1827","0007-0920"],"issue":"9","journal":"British Journal of Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1445453964,"links":["http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/bjc\/rss\/aop\/~3\/WG0K5FWijF8\/bjc.2015.364"],"pmid":"26484411","pubdate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1254","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Impact of mutational status on survival in low-grade serous carcinoma of the ovary or peritoneum","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/bjc.2015.364","volume":"113","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-mutational-status-survival-lowgrade-serous-carcinoma-ovary-peritoneum"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6356958,"mean":5.9827593932131,"rank":828976,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":5474576,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6356958,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232856,"mean":9.3077888729037,"rank":41555,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":188174,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232856,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3034,"mean":8.8342729970326,"rank":911,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":1928,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3034,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82,"mean":12.781407407407,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Unspecified":2}}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Impact of mutational status on survival in lowgrade serous carcinoma of the ovary or peritoneum","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=23101636160&p=1pl&v=1&x=7e9HUNBZZtTuNxNPjLi7Gg","license":"public","citation_ids":[4820226],"posted_on":"2015-10-21T18:54:01+00:00","summary":"Related Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical and Healthcare News Original Article: Impact of mutational status on survival in low-grade serous carcinoma of the ovary or peritoneum NEXT ARTICLE More From BioPortfolio on \"Impact of mutational status on\u2026","author":{"name":"Bioportfolio","url":"http:\/\/www.bioportfolio.com\/","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/000\/821\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2015-12-11_at_16.36.54.png?1449851849"}},{"title":"Impact of mutational status on survival in low-grade serous carcinoma of the ovary or peritoneum","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=23101668697&p=1pl&v=1&x=d6BWl8KeRL0a1gp5-pXeFA","license":"public","citation_ids":[4820226],"posted_on":"2015-10-21T18:59:24+00:00","summary":"Related Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical and Healthcare News Original Article: NEXT ARTICLE More From BioPortfolio on \"Impact of mutational status on survival in low-grade serous carcinoma of the ovary or peritoneum\".","author":{"name":"Bioportfolio","url":"http:\/\/www.bioportfolio.com\/","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/000\/821\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2015-12-11_at_16.36.54.png?1449851849"}}]}}
