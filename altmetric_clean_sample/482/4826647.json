All of them answered a structured questionnaire for demographic and clinical data and underwent upper endoscopy. Anxiety and depression were assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD).\nThe distribution of subtypes was: IBS-diarrhea (IBS-D), 46%; IBS-constipation (IBS-C), 32%, and mixed IBS (IBS-M), 22%. IBS overlap with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), functional dyspepsia, chronic headache and fibromyalgia occurred in 65.5%, 48.7%, 40.7% and 22.1% of patients, respectively. Anxiety and\/or depression were found in 81.5%. Comparisons among subgroups showed that bloating was significantly associated with IBS-M compared to IBS-D (odds ratio-OR-5.6). Straining was more likely to be reported by IBS-M (OR 15.3) and IBS-C (OR 12.0) compared to IBS-D patients, while urgency was associated with both IBS-M (OR 19.7) and IBS-D (OR 14.2) compared to IBS-C. In addition, IBS-M patients were more likely to present GERD than IBS-D (OR 6.7) and higher scores for anxiety than IBS-C patients (OR 1.2). BMI values did not differ between IBS-D and IBS-C.\nIBS-M is characterized by symptoms frequently reported by both IBS-C (straining) and IBS-D (urgency), higher levels of anxiety, and high prevalence of comorbidities. These features should be considered in the clinical management of this subgroup.","altmetric_jid":"56a768e12a83eeb12a8b4909","authors":["Kibune Nagasako, Cristiane","Garcia Montes, Ciro","Silva Lorena, S\u00f4nia Let\u00edcia","Mesquita, Maria Aparecida"],"doi":"10.17235\/reed.2015.3979\/2015","first_seen_on":"2015-12-01T11:11:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1130-0108"],"issue":"2","journal":"Revista Espa\u00f1ola de Enfermedades Digestivas","last_mentioned_on":1448967892,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26616258?dopt=Abstract&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed"],"pmid":"26616258","pubdate":"2015-12-01T22:01:06+00:00","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Irritable bowel syndrome subtypes: Clinical and psychological features, body mass index and comorbidities.","type":"article","volume":"108","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/irritable-bowel-syndrome-subtypes-clinical-psychological-features-body-mass-index-comorbidities"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6632903,"mean":6.1476115477016,"rank":4907248,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":973459,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6632903,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252577,"mean":9.1918411250473,"rank":171931,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":52519,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252577,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232,"mean":1.5141991341991,"rank":131,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":74,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":1.8848484848485,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
