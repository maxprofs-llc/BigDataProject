The cloned 546\u2009bp ahpC gene encodes a 181 amino acid residues polypeptide. The AhpC belongs to typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxin (Prx) containing conserved peroxidatic cysteine residue (C46 ) required for hydroperoxide reduction and conserved resolving cysteine (C166 ). The isolated 1530\u2009bp ahpF gene encodes a polypeptide of 509 amino acid residues with two conserved C128 HNC131 and C337 PHC340 catalytic residues required for reduction of oxidized-AhpC during catalytic turnover. A survival study with Escherichia coli showed that overexpression of AhpC and AhpF resulted in a total protection against 0.16 mM t-butyl hydroperoxide.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f61000662d","authors":["Natalia, Dessy","Jumadila, Ozi","Anggraini, Irika Devi","Meutia, Febrina","Puspasari, Fernita","Hasan, Khomaini"],"doi":"10.1002\/jobm.201500406","endpage":"837","first_seen_on":"2015-11-30T04:00:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-4028"],"issue":"7","journal":"Journal of Basic Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1448855998,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/jobm.201500406#.VlvJoVKi-2U.twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jobm.201500406\/pdf","pmid":"26523844","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"834","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Alkyl hydroperoxide reductase from Bacillus aquimaris MKSC 6.2 protects Esherichia coli from oxidative stress","type":"article","volume":"56","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alkyl-hydroperoxide-reductase-ibacillus-aquimarisi-mksc-62-protects-iesherichia-colii-oxidative-stre"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6625817,"mean":6.1430520464149,"rank":3156219,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1978694,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6625817,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252645,"mean":9.1803253273377,"rank":132622,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":93138,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252645,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":373,"mean":2.7116827956989,"rank":171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":155,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":373,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":3.466,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ID":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/lesanrego\/statuses\/671176821698785281","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4821468],"posted_on":"2015-11-30T03:59:58+00:00","author":{"name":"khomaini hasan","url":"http:\/\/hasankhomaini.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/416562337072418816\/dd8iSqUh_normal.jpeg","description":"Biochemist, Enzymologist, Protein Engineer, Protein Chemist, Biotechnologist, Chemist","id_on_source":"lesanrego","tweeter_id":"109358594","geo":{"lt":-6.21462,"ln":106.84513,"country":"ID"},"followers":310},"tweet_id":"671176821698785281"}]}}
