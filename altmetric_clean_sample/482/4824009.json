In recent years, numerous small particle columns for size exclusion chromatography of biologicals have been introduced. Small particles are a strategy to reduce analysis time. In the following study, opportunities of small particles in size exclusion chromatography of large biomolecules are investigated. Poppe plots reveal that the lower particle size limit depends on the size of the sample molecule. Hydrodynamic radii of monoclonal antibody monomer, aggregates and H1N1 as well as the diffusion coefficients were determined. Considering this sample compound dependency, kinetic plots referring to the resolution of a distinct compound pair instead of the plate number of a single analyte are more meaningful. Plate times were found to be equivalent with 4 and 2\u03bcm particles for a monoclonal antibody aggregate separation at resolutions smaller than 1.8. Quantification of a H1N1 in clarified cell culture can be accomplished with 17\u03bcm and 13\u03bcm particles at equal plate times at resolutions smaller than 2.5. Virus polydispersity is likely to be affected by run times of several hours at room temperature and shear forces resulting from particles smaller than 10\u03bcm. Comparatively high flow rates should be applied in size exclusion chromatography of the 100nm H1N1 virions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cf6","authors":["Vajda, Judith","Conze, Werner","M\u00fcller, Egbert"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.chroma.2015.11.057","first_seen_on":"2015-11-30T21:23:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00219673","1873-3778"],"journal":"Journal of Chromatography A","last_mentioned_on":1453760115,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0021967315016854"],"pmid":"26643721","pubdate":"2015-12-09T22:03:14+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Kinetic plots in aqueous size exclusion chromatography of monoclonal antibodies and virus particles ","type":"article","volume":"1426","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/kinetic-plots-aqueous-size-exclusion-chromatography-monoclonal-antibodies-virus-particles"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7028853,"mean":6.2639093712573,"rank":3059782,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":3810333,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7028853,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283766,"mean":8.6916185364649,"rank":118723,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":155417,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283766,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2314,"mean":2.0549891915262,"rank":659,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":1574,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2314,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":3.0644444444444,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
