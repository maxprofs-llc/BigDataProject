The ability to acquire simultaneous, and dynamic multimodal data is perhaps PET\/MR's greatest strength that will be of major interest to researchers investigating carotid and coronary atherosclerosis alike. This review summarizes the current status of dedicated hybrid PET\/MR imaging; to crystallize the rationale for and advantages of this technique with respect to carotid atherosclerosis; and to discuss current limitations, challenges, and future directions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b58","authors":["Vesey, Alex T","Dweck, Marc R","Fayad, Zahi A","Alex T.
