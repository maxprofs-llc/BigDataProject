This study aimed to identify the most effective method of treating segmental tibial fractures.\nA PRISMA compliant systematic review was conducted. Studies investigating the management of segmental tibial fractures with intramedullary nail fixation (IMN), open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) or circular external fixation (CEF) were included for review. The primary outcome measure was time to fracture union. Secondary outcomes were complications and functional outcome. A narrative analysis was undertaken as meta-analysis was inappropriate due to heterogeneity of the data.\nThirteen studies were eligible and included. No randomised controlled trials were identified. Fixation with an intramedullary nail provided the fastest time to union, followed by open reduction and internal fixation and then CEF. The rate of deep infection was highest after IMN (5\/162 [3%]), followed by open reduction and internal fixation (2\/78 [2.5%]) and CEF (1\/54 [2%]). However, some studies reported particularly high rates of infection following IMN for open segmental tibial fractures. There was limited reporting of postoperative deformities. From the studies that did include such data, there was a higher rate of deformity following ORIF (8\/53 [15%]), compared to IMN (13\/138 [9%]), and CEF (4\/44 [9%]). Three studies, not including IMN, described patient reported outcome measures with results ranging from 'excellent' to 'fair'.\nThe available evidence was of poor quality, dominated by retrospective case series. This prevented statistical analysis, and precludes firm conclusions being drawn from the results available.\nIMN has the fastest time to fracture union, however there are concerns regarding an increased deep infection rate in open segmental tibial fractures. In this subgroup, the data suggests CEF provides the most satisfactory results. However, the available literature does not provide sufficient detail to make this statement with certainty. We recommend a randomised controlled study to further investigate this challenging problem.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ade","authors":["McMahon, Samuel E","Little, Zoe E","Smith, Toby O","Trompeter, Alex","Hing, Caroline B"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.injury.2015.11.022","first_seen_on":"2015-11-30T17:17:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0020-1383","1879-0267"],"journal":"Injury","last_mentioned_on":1458133846,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0020138315007445"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.injuryjournal.com\/article\/S0020138315007445\/pdf","pmid":"26776463","pubdate":"2016-01-19T22:01:57+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"title":"The management of segmental tibial shaft fractures: a systematic review","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/management-segmental-tibial-shaft-fractures-systematic-review-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.45,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7401456,"mean":6.433764966749,"rank":2927417,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4466765,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7401456,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":287770,"mean":8.79558169921,"rank":96557,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":190771,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":287770,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1209,"mean":4.7785397350993,"rank":610,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":597,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1209,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":4.133,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
