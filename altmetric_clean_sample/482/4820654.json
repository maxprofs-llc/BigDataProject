TDA is of interest not only as a probiotic in aquaculture, but also because it might be of use as an antibacterial agent in non-marine or non-aquatic environments, and thus the potentially cytotoxic influences on eukaryotic cells need to be evaluated. The present study was undertaken to investigate its effects on cells of the mammalian nervous system, i.e., neuronal N2a cells and OLN-93 cells as model systems for nerve cells and glia. The data show that in both cell lines TDA exerted morphological changes and cytotoxic effects at a concentration of 0.3-0.5 \u00b5g\/mL (1.4-2.4 \u00b5M). Furthermore, TDA caused a breakdown of the mitochondrial membrane potential, the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1\/2, and the induction of the small heat shock protein HSP32\/HO-1, which is considered as a sensor of oxidative stress. The cytotoxic effects were accompanied by an increase in intracellular Ca(2+)-levels, the disturbance of the microtubule network, and the reorganization of the microfilament system. Hence, mammalian cells are a sensitive target for the action of TDA and react by the activation of a stress response resulting in cell death.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f61000668a","authors":["Heidi Wichmann"],"doi":"10.3390\/md13127058","endpage":"7123","first_seen_on":"2015-11-30T00:23:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1660-3397"],"issue":"12","journal":"Marine Drugs","last_mentioned_on":1483043875,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-3397\/13\/12\/7058","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3390\/md13127058"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-3397\/13\/12\/7058\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4699232","pmid":"26633426","pubdate":"2015-11-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"7113","subjects":["biology","pharmacology"],"title":"Cytotoxic Effects of Tropodithietic Acid on Mammalian Clonal Cell Lines of Neuronal and Glial Origin","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cytotoxic-effects-tropodithietic-acid-mammalian-clonal-cell-lines-neuronal-glial-origin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7953275,"mean":6.7183323059095,"rank":3703070,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":4072379,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7953275,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":294867,"mean":8.8223575793748,"rank":125191,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":159392,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":294867,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1013,"mean":3.5273992094862,"rank":425,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":547,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1013,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":5.5141791044776,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
