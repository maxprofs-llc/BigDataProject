Because of its frequent use any adverse effects on infant health would have major public health implications. We therefore examined the safety of metoclopramide during pregnancy.\nUsing the Pharmaco-Epidemiological Prescription Database of North Jutland County, we identified 309 women with singleton pregnancies who had prescriptions for metoclopramide fom 1 January 1991 to 31 December 1996. Information on malformations, birth weight, preterm deliveries and stillbirth were compared with 13 327 references who did not receive prescriptions of any kind during pregnancy.\nMean birth weight among exposed women was 3480 g compared with 3470 g among nonexposed. Based on logistic regression models no major differences in the risk were found concerning malformations (OR= 1.11; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.6-2.1); low birth weight (OR= 1.79; 95% CI: 0.8-3.9) or preterm delivery (OR= 1.02; 95 CI: 0.6-1.7).\nWe could not document any association between the use of metoclopramide during pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcome. Because of the limited power of our study further research is required.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000243e","authors":["S\u00f8rensen, H T","Nielsen, G L","Christensen, K","Tage-Jensen, U","Ekbom, A","Baron, J"],"first_seen_on":"2017-07-07T21:11:56+00:00","issns":["0306-5251"],"issue":"3","journal":"British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1381867200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10718782"],"pmcid":"PMC2014919","pmid":"10718782","pubdate":"2000-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Birth outcome following maternal use of metoclopramide.
