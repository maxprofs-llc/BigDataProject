We hypothesized that children with enhancing arteriopathies on vessel wall imaging (VWI) would have a higher risk of arteriopathy progression than those without enhancement.\nOur institutional radiographic database was searched for cases of childhood stroke with VWI. Inclusion criteria consisted of age ranging from 1 month through 20 years, diagnosis of arterial ischemic stroke, available VWI, and follow-up magnetic resonance angiogram. Imaging was reviewed to systematically describe VWI findings, categorize arteriopathies, steroid therapy, and identify progressive arteriopathies using CACADE definitions.\nSixteen cases of childhood stroke at Children's Hospital Colorado between January 1, 2010 and July 1, 2016 were reviewed. Strong vessel wall enhancement at presentation was associated with progressive arteriopathy in 83% of cases (10\/12), when compared with 0% (0\/4) without strong enhancement (P=0.008).\nOur case series demonstrates the potential benefit of VWI in children with stroke because it may identify patients who will have progressive arterial disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005cfc","authors":["Nicholas V.
