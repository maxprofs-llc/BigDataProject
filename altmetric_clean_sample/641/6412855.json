Analysis of the approximately 1,200 answers revealed that ticks are present in all parts of Svealand (except northern V\u00e4rmland and northern and western Dalarna), the southeastern part of Norrland (i.e., G\u00e4strikland and H\u00e4lsingland), and along the Baltic Sea coast of central and northern Norrland. The proportion of answers reporting ticks and the estimated tick density (i.e., the number of ticks infesting dogs and cats) decreased from south to north. The answers to the questionnaire and data from field sampling of ticks suggest that tick density decreased distinctly along a narrow boundary zone, coinciding with the biological limit of Norrland (Limes Norrlandicus), crossing Sweden through southern V\u00e4rmland, southeastern Dalarna, and central G\u00e4strikland. The results of the questionnaire suggest that I. ricinus ticks are more widespread today than in the early 1980s, especially in V\u00e4rmland, western and central Dalarna, H\u00e4lsingland, and the coastal areas of Medelpad, Angermanland, and V\u00e4sterbotten, and that the proportion of the human population at risk for tick-borne pathogens in Svealand and Norrland is increasing.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006651","authors":["T\u00e4lleklint, L","Jaenson, T G"],"first_seen_on":"2016-03-31T20:31:03+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0022-2585"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Medical Entomology","last_mentioned_on":1459456007,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9701939"],"pmid":"9701939","pubdate":"1998-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Veterinary","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Increasing geographical distribution and density of Ixodes ricinus (Acari: Ixodidae) in central and northern Sweden.","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increasing-geographical-distribution-density-ixodes-ricinus-acari-ixodidae-central-northern-sweden"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7746608,"mean":6.6301930380554,"rank":575243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7163893,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7746608,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275708,"mean":11.124289611798,"rank":31304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":244246,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275708,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1177,"mean":10.324819727891,"rank":100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":1074,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1177,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":64.48825,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
