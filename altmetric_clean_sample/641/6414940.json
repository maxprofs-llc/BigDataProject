The embryos were cryopreserved once they had yielded good-quality blastocysts and then transferred (one per cycle) during subsequent cycles.\nNumber of mature oocytes (metaphase II) and resulting live births yielded via oocyte retrieval from the initial cycle of treatment.\nAmong 771 women, nondominant small follicle puncture yielded 902 metaphase II oocytes and 78 live births, whereas large dominant follicle puncture yielded 466 metaphase II oocytes and 90 live births. Successes in oocyte retrieval and live births resulting from small follicle puncture were positively correlated with ovarian reserve but did not depend on the outcomes of the dominant follicle puncture.\nNondominant small follicles are a promising supplementary source of mature oocytes for natural cycle IVF.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028c7","authors":["Shokichi Teramoto","Hisao Osada","Yasunori Sato","Makio Shozu","Teramoto, Shokichi","Osada, Hisao","Sato, Yasunori","Shozu, Makio"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.fertnstert.2016.03.015","first_seen_on":"2016-04-01T00:03:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1556-5653","00150282"],"journal":"Fertility & Sterility","last_mentioned_on":1461083837,"links":["http:\/\/www.fertstert.org\/article\/S0015-0282(16)30048-6\/abstract?rss=yes","http:\/\/www.fertstert.org\/article\/S0015-0282(16)30048-6\/abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27041027"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.fertstert.org\/article\/S0015028216300486\/pdf","pmid":"27041027","pubdate":"2016-03-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Nondominant small follicles are a promising source of mature oocytes in modified natural cycle in\u00a0vitro fertilization and embryo transfer","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nondominant-small-follicles-promising-source-mature-oocytes-modified-natural-cycle-invitro-fertiliza"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7571218,"mean":6.5337981331095,"rank":3356289,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4140138,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7571218,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":273698,"mean":11.138790421524,"rank":118866,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":150223,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":273698,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3916,"mean":6.4384240102171,"rank":2189,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":1617,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3916,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":134,"mean":15.508180451128,"rank":74,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":134,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
