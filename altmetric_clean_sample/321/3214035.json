Up until modern times, cultures throughout history have associated different substances with specific deities, incorporated them into specific myths, and used substances in specific rituals. Examining these associations is likely to give insight into how these substances were viewed in various cultures and the place that they had in those cultures. Consequently, we offer this new feature exploring these associations as a way of increasing understanding of the functions of substance use in different cultures over historical time.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5373cf058f610004624","authors":["Theodore M.
