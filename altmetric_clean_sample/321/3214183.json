The drugs were administered t.i.d. and the tests were done after the very last capsule was given. It was ingested with a placebo drink and 0.5 g alcohol\/kg body weight. Oxazepam and methyloxazepam alone behaved similar to the placebo. Immediate memory was significantly impaired following the treatment with nordiazepam, chlordiazepoxide lactam, alcohol, and after the simultaneous administration of nordiazepam and chlordiazepoxide lactam with alcohol. Chlordiazepoxide lactam was the only drug which alone impaired associative learning. Also alcohol alone, and all the drugs in combination with alcohol retarded learning acquisition.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9153cf058f61000cf0a","authors":["R Liljequist","E Palva","M Linnoila"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T20:47:21+00:00","issns":["0020-8272"],"issue":"4","journal":"International pharmacopsychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1259065007,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/42628","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/42628"],"pmid":"42628","pubdate":"1979-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["psychiatry","pharmacology"],"title":"Effects on learning and memory of 2-week treatments with chlordiazepoxide lactam, N-desmethyldiazepam, oxazepam and methyloxazepam, alone or in combination with alcohol.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-learning-memory-2week-treatments-chlordiazepoxide-lactam-ndesmethyldiazepam-oxazepam-methylo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628824,"mean":4.9380564480592,"rank":816738,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2289207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628824,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94891,"mean":8.0899311202447,"rank":24707,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69090,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94891,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":3.0412857142857,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3},"by_discipline":{"Psychology":4,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Klooridiatsepoksidi","url":"http:\/\/fi.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=7636963#altmetric_citation_0","license":"public","citation_ids":[3214183],"posted_on":"2009-11-24T12:16:47+00:00","summary":"Klooridiatsepoksidilla on keskipitk\/pitk eliminaation puoliintumisaika, mutta sen aktiivisella metaboliitilla (desmetyylidiatsepaami), on hyvin pitk puoliintumisaika: 36-200 tuntia.","page_url":"http:\/\/fi.wikipedia.org\/?curid=751901","wiki_lang":"fi","author":{"name":"Styroks","url":"http:\/\/fi.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Styroks"}},{"title":"Chlordiazepoxide","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=232195776#altmetric_citation_29","license":"public","citation_ids":[3214183],"posted_on":"2008-08-15T22:39:39+00:00","summary":"Chlordiazepoxide was the first benzodiazepine to be synthesized and the discovery of chlordiazepoxide was by pure chance.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=6320556","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Literaturegeek","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Literaturegeek"}},{"title":"Temazepam","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=232195149#altmetric_citation_75","license":"public","citation_ids":[3214183],"posted_on":"2008-08-15T22:36:00+00:00","summary":"The United States Air Force uses temazepam as one of the hypnotics approved as &quot;no-go pills&quot; to help aviators and special-duty personnel sleep in support of mission readiness.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=239812","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Literaturegeek","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Literaturegeek"}}]}}
