These structures were observed at significantly lower beta hCG levels by means of the vaginal probe in comparison with the abdominal one. In normal pregnancy a gestational sac of 1-3 mm was detected at a mean hCG level of 1150 UI\/l (range 800-1500); the yolk sac was detected at a mean hCG level of 6000 UI\/l (range 4500-7500); fetal hart motion was visible at a mean hCG level of 10,425 UI\/l (range 8650-12,200). The yolk sac and fetal heart motion were always detected when the gestational sac was greater than 11 and 17 mm respectively. A practical method to evaluate early first trimester pregnancy is suggested.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081b2","authors":["F Giacomello","P Magliocchetti","G Loyola","M Giovarruscio"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T21:16:47+00:00","issns":["0026-4784"],"issue":"7-8","journal":"Minerva Ginecologica","last_mentioned_on":1442981345,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8414139","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8414139"],"pmid":"8414139","pubdate":"2015-09-23T01:12:40+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gynecology"],"title":"[Serum beta hCG levels and transvaginal echography in the early phases of pregnancy].","type":"article","volume":"45","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/serum-beta-hcg-levels-transvaginal-echography-early-phases-pregnancy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6392320,"mean":5.8550254022053,"rank":1233404,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":5122780,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6392320,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195517,"mean":8.6520896908694,"rank":49755,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":145147,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195517,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123,"mean":1.95,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.06,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SailorMoonsBird\/statuses\/646492271509028864","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[3215786],"posted_on":"2015-09-23T01:12:23+00:00","author":{"name":"SailorMoonsBird","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/637142741189718016\/ySIGy5TQ_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"SailorMoonsBird","tweeter_id":"3367280894","followers":2},"tweet_id":"646492271509028864"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SailorMoonsBird\/statuses\/646536740941918208","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[2372410,3215786],"posted_on":"2015-09-23T04:09:05+00:00","author":{"name":"SailorMoonsBird","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/637142741189718016\/ySIGy5TQ_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"SailorMoonsBird","tweeter_id":"3367280894","followers":2},"tweet_id":"646536740941918208"}],"wikipedia":[{"title":"Human chorionic gonadotropin","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=635623308#altmetric_citation_18","license":"public","citation_ids":[3215786],"posted_on":"2014-11-27T07:57:37+00:00","summary":"In molecular biology, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone produced by the syncytiotrophoblast, a portion of the placenta following implantation.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=300445","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Mikael H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Mikael H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m"}}]}}
