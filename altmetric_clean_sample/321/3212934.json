However, a number of studies revealed its ability to invade epithelial cells, indicating a more complex pathogen-host interaction. The molecular mechanisms controlling and facilitating internalization of C. diphtheriae are only poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the role of DIP0733 as virulence factor to elucidate how it contributes to the process of pathogen-host cell interaction. Based on in vitro experiments, it was suggested recently that the DIP0733 protein might be involved in adhesion, invasion of epithelial cells and induction of apoptosis. A corresponding C. diphtheriae mutant strain generated in this study was attenuated in its ability to colonize and kill the host in a Caenorhabditis elegans infection model system. Furthermore, the mutant showed an altered adhesion pattern and a drastically reduced ability to adhere and invade epithelial cells. Subsequently carried out experiments showed an influence of DIP0733 on binding of C. diphtheriae to extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen and fibronectin. Furthermore, based on its fibrinogen-binding activity, DIP0733 may play a role to avoid the recognition of C. diphtheriae by the immune system. In summary, our findings support the idea that DIP0733 is a multi-functional virulence factor of C. diphtheriae.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f610004208","authors":["Camila Azevedo Antunes","Louisy Sanches Dos Santos","Elena Hacker","Stefanie K\u00f6hler","Korbinian B\u00f6sl","Lisa Ott","Maria das Gra\u00e7as de Luna","Raphael Hirata","Vasco Ariston de Carvalho Azevedo","Ana-Luiza Mattos-Guaraldi","Andreas Burkovski"],"doi":"10.1099\/mic.0.000020","first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T20:25:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1465-2080"],"journal":"Microbiology (13500872)","last_mentioned_on":1422706774,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25635272?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25635272","pubdate":"2015-01-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Characterization of DIP0733, a multi-functional virulence factor of Corynebacterium diphtheriae.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterization-dip0733-multifunctional-virulence-factor-corynebacterium-diphtheriae"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4693373,"mean":5.709262641019,"rank":2333342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2218847,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4693373,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163905,"mean":8.8009876879153,"rank":77709,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":78619,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163905,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":907,"mean":2.7548785871965,"rank":513,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":373,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":907,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":1.7794117647059,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
