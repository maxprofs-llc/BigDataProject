Here, we show that TGF-\u03b2-receptor signaling is required during gastrulation to pattern the anterior skeleton. To block TGF-\u03b2 signaling, we used SB431542 (SB43), a specific inhibitor of the TGF-\u03b2 type I receptor Alk4\/5\/7. Treatment with SB43 during gastrulation blocks anterior PMC positioning and the formation of the anterior skeleton, but does not perturb general ectoderm specification or development. This is the first example of a signaling event required for patterning of a specific part of the skeleton. Alk4\/5\/7 inhibition does not prevent the formation of a mouth, although SB43-treated plutei display reduced feeding ability, presumably due to the loss of the structural support for the mouth conferred by the anterior skeleton. Both Univin and Nodal are potential ligands for Alk4\/5\/7; however, Nodal is unilaterally expressed on only the right side, whereas Univin is bilaterally expressed in the ectoderm adjacent to the anterior skeleton during the relevant time period. Our results demonstrate that Univin is both necessary and sufficient for secondary skeletal development in a control background, consistent with the hypothesis that Univin is a relevant Alk4\/5\/7 ligand for anterior skeletal patterning. Taken together, our data demonstrate that Alk4\/5\/7 signaling during gastrulation is required to direct PMCs to the oral hood, and suggest that Univin is a relevant ligand for this signaling event.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026e9","authors":["Michael L Piacentino","Janani Ramachandran","Cynthia A Bradham","Michael L.
