Nicorandil induced ulcers are very painful and distressing for patients. Clinically they appear as large, deep, persistent ulcers that have punched out edges. They are poorly responsive to topical steroids and usually require alteration of nicorandil treatment. The ulceration tends to occur at high doses of nicorandil and all four cases reported here were on doses of 40 mg per day or greater. In these situations reduction of nicorandil dose may be sufficient to promote ulcer healing and prevent further recurrence. However, nicorandil induced ulcers have been reported at doses as low as 10 mg daily and complete cessation of nicorandil may be required.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029cd","authors":["C M Healy","Y Smyth","S R Flint"],"doi":"10.1136\/hrt.2003.031831","first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T20:33:11+00:00","issns":["1468-201X"],"journal":"Heart","last_mentioned_on":1356596231,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/hrt.2003.031831","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15201264","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1768343"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/heart.bmj.com\/content\/90\/7\/e38.full.pdf","pmid":"15201264","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Persistent nicorandil induced oral ulceration","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/persistent-nicorandil-induced-oral-ulceration"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630293,"mean":4.9302727339889,"rank":816223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2291512,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630293,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95098,"mean":8.1129589997584,"rank":24800,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69200,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95098,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1484,"mean":4.5019487525287,"rank":352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":1040,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1484,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":9.6493333333333,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":55,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Mouth ulcer","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=529949266#altmetric_citation_6","license":"public","citation_ids":[3213405],"posted_on":"2012-12-27T08:17:11+00:00","summary":"A mouth ulcer (also termed an oral ulcer, or a mucosal ulcer) is an ulcer that occurs on the mucous membrane of the oral cavity.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=245973","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Lesion","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Lesion"}}]}}
