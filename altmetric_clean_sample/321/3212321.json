We report a woman with unilateral symptoms probably related to brachial plexus neuritis. Electromyography revealed localised neuropathic and generalised myopathic abnormalities. The typical features of DNM2 centronuclear myopathy with additional necklace fibres were found in the muscle biopsy. Sequencing of the DNM2 and MTM1 genes revealed a novel heterozygous missense mutation in exon 18 of the DNM2, leading to replacement of highly conserved proline at position 647 by arginine. The muscle symptoms have not progressed during the 3-year follow-up. However, the patient has developed bilateral subtle lens opacities. Our findings support the concept that necklace fibres may occasionally be found in DNM2-related myopathy, possibly indicating a common pathogenic mechanism in DNM2 and MTM1 associated centronuclear myopathy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f61000319b","authors":["Olivera Casar-Borota","Johan Jacobsson","Rolf Libelius","Carola Hedberg Oldfors","Edoardo Malfatti","Norma Beatriz Romero","Anders Oldfors"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.nmd.2015.01.001","first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T20:14:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-2364","0960-8966"],"journal":"Neuromuscular Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1422787776,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25633151?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nmd-journal.com%2Farticle%2FS0960-8966%252815%252900020-6%2Fabstract%3Frss%3Dyes&code=nmd-site","http:\/\/www.nmd-journal.com\/article\/S0960-8966(15)00020-6\/abstract?rss=yes","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25633151?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25633151","pubdate":"2015-01-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"A novel dynamin-2 gene mutation associated with a late-onset centronuclear myopathy with necklace fibres","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-dynamin2-gene-mutation-associated-lateonset-centronuclear-myopathy-necklace-fibres"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4698042,"mean":5.7124864691489,"rank":1073191,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":3612521,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4698042,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164061,"mean":8.7921401072782,"rank":45186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":118205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164061,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":625,"mean":1.4244134615385,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":592,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":625,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":0.95178571428571,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
