However, the reuse of breakpoints coincident with centromeres in the evolution of divergent karyotypes poses a potential paradox. In distantly related species where the same centromere breakpoints are used in the independent derivation of karyotypes, centromere-specific sequences may undergo convergent evolution rather than rapid sequence divergence. To determine whether centromere sequence composition follows the phylogenetic history of species evolution or patterns of convergent breakpoint reuse through chromosome evolution, we examined the phylogenetic trajectory of centromere sequences within a group of karyotypically diverse mammals, macropodine marsupials (wallabies, wallaroos and kangaroos).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6ec3cf058f610009ffb","authors":["Kira V Bulazel","Gianni C Ferreri","Mark DB Eldridge","Rachel J O'Neill","Bulazel KV","Ferreri GC","Eldridge MD","O'Neill RJ"],"doi":"10.1186\/gb-2007-8-8-r170","first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T20:54:51+00:00","issns":["1465-6906","14656906"],"issue":"8","journal":"Genome Biology (Online Edition)","last_mentioned_on":1339811574,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/gb-2007-8-8-r170","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17708770","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2375000"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/genomebiology.com\/content\/pdf\/gb-2007-8-8-r170.pdf","pmcid":"PMC2375000","pmid":"17708770","pubdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Bioinformatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Fungus Genetics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Genetics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Genetics & Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"R170","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Species-specific shifts in centromere sequence composition are coincident with breakpoint reuse in karyotypically divergent lineages","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/speciesspecific-shifts-centromere-sequence-composition-coincident-breakpoint-reuse-karyotypically-di"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628302,"mean":4.942517914036,"rank":817173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288074,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628302,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94780,"mean":8.0833800525435,"rank":24673,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69017,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94780,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1553,"mean":13.906475515464,"rank":954,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":451,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1553,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":26.369826086957,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Ph.
