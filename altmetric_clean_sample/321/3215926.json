Established successes, such as the drugs designed against HIV-1 protease and neuraminidase, demonstrate the utility of a structure-based approach in the drug-discovery process. However, the approach has historically lacked throughput and reliability capabilities; these bottlenecks are being overcome by breakthroughs in high-throughput structural biology. Recent technological innovations such as submicroliter high-throughput crystallization, high-performance synchrotron beamlines and rapid binding-site analysis of de novo targets using virtual ligand screening and small molecule co-crystallization have resulted in a significant advance in structure-based drug discovery.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a1","authors":["Peter Kuhn","Keith Wilson","Marianne G Patch","Raymond C Stevens"],"doi":"10.1016\/s1367-5931(02)00361-7","endpage":"710","first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T21:20:23+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["13675931","1367-5931"],"issue":"5","journal":"Current Opinion in Chemical Biology","last_mentioned_on":1484301618,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S1367-5931(02)00361-7"],"pmid":"12413557","pubdate":"2002-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"704","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"The genesis of high-throughput structure-based drug discovery using protein crystallography","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genesis-highthroughput-structurebased-drug-discovery-using-protein-crystallography-8"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8069307,"mean":6.8479199559378,"rank":2028602,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4928755,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8069307,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240142,"mean":8.2109060760137,"rank":68467,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":166055,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240142,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":740,"mean":2.9423815967524,"rank":149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":442,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":740,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":2.464,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
