Significant necroscopic signs as well as the data reported from witnesses or medical records may be absent, biological fluids as blood or urine may be unavailable or under thanatological modifications. The aim of this review is to focus on the diagnostic difficulties with which coroners and forensic pathologists have to cope when a confirmation of anaphylactic death is required by judicial authorities. Investigation methods for a prudent forensic diagnosis of anaphylactic death as well as the need of new potential laboratory or histological investigation techniques coming from immunological research are discussed too.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002900","doi":"10.1016\/j.forsciint.2010.04.039","first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T21:29:26+00:00","issns":["0379-0738"],"journal":"Forensic Science International","last_mentioned_on":1327456336,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.forsciint.2010.04.039","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20684869"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.fsijournal.org\/article\/S0379073810002185\/pdf","pmid":"20684869","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["jurisprudence"],"title":"Post-mortem diagnosis of anaphylaxis: A difficult task in forensic medicine.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/postmortem-diagnosis-anaphylaxis-difficult-task-forensic-medicine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628302,"mean":4.942517914036,"rank":817167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288086,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628302,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94781,"mean":8.0833971090949,"rank":24673,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69018,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94781,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":876,"mean":3.2515497142857,"rank":191,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":535,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":876,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.4222222222222,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Other":5,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":2,"Professor":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":16,"Chemistry":3,"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"AR":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Anaphylaxis","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=473084641#altmetric_citation_39","license":"public","citation_ids":[3216323],"posted_on":"2012-01-25T01:52:16+00:00","summary":"Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=74240","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Doc James","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Doc James"}}]}}
