The phenomenon can be demonstrated using human and xenogeneic (mouse) cell lines as the target cell in a microplate 51Cr release assay which is simple and reproducible. In this paper, SLMC against xenogeneic targets has been evaluated as a potential marker of lumphocytotoxic function with respect to: (a) the nature of the target cell; (b) the variability of the cytotoxic function of lymphocytes from different donors, and from the same donor tested on different days; (c) the nature of the effector cell. Using buoyant density centrifugation of iron plus magnetpurified lymphocytes forming rosettes with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) (T-cells) or SRBC-rabbit 19S anti-SRBC-mouse complement (complement receptor lymphocyte), it has been demonstrated that the cytotoxic activity lies in the non-T-lymphocyte fraction, and is probably caused by the complement receptor-bearing lymphocyte. The potential usefulness of this phenomenon as a functional marker of non-T-LYMPHOCYTE CYTOTOXIC Ability, and for the assessment of serological factors ehich may affect this cytotoxicity, has been discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002548","authors":["H F Pross","M Jondal"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T19:46:07+00:00","issns":["0009-9104"],"issue":"2","journal":"Clinical & Experimental Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1339693998,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/810282","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1538269"],"pmcid":"PMC1538269","pmid":"810282","pubdate":"1975-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Cytotoxic lymphocytes from normal donors.
