Intravenous infusion of ANP (10 ng\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1)) slightly but significantly decreased plasma AVP levels, while intravenous infusion of ANG II (10 ng\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1)) resulted in slightly increased plasma AVP levels. ANG II infused significant elevations in arterial blood pressure and central venous pressure (CVP). Because the elevation in blood pressure could have potentially inhibited AVP secretion via baroreceptor reflexes, the effect of ANG II on blood pressure was attenuated by the simultaneous infusion of nitroprusside. ANG II alone produced a remarkable increase in plasma AVP levels when infused with nitroprusside, whereas the simultaneous ANP intravenous infusion (10 ng\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1)) abolished the increase in plasma AVP levels induced by ANG II when blood pressure elevation was attenuated by nitroprusside. Thus, ANG II increased AVP secretion and ANP inhibited not only basal AVP secretion but also ANG II-stimulated AVP secretion in humans. These findings support the hypothesis that circulating ANP modulates AVP secretion, in part, by antagonizing the action of circulating ANG II.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002212","authors":["Toshiyoshi Matsukawa","Takenori Miyamoto","Matsukawa T","Miyamoto T"],"doi":"10.1152\/ajpregu.00324.2010","first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T20:03:16+00:00","issns":["0363-6119","1522-1490"],"issue":"3","journal":"American Journal of Physiology: Regulatory, Integrative & Comparative Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1304316736,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1152\/ajpregu.00324.2010","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21123762"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ajpregu.physiology.org\/content\/ajpregu\/300\/3\/R624.full.pdf","pmid":"21123762","pubdate":"2011-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Physiological Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Angiotensin II-stimulated secretion of arginine vasopressin is inhibited by atrial natriuretic peptide in humans.","type":"article","volume":"300","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/angiotensin-iistimulated-secretion-arginine-vasopressin-inhibited-atrial-natriuretic-peptide-humans"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628496,"mean":4.94108381299,"rank":817076,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288377,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628496,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94815,"mean":8.0837199991564,"rank":24680,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69044,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94815,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":786,"mean":4.4732585987261,"rank":197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":528,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":786,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":2.2027692307692,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
