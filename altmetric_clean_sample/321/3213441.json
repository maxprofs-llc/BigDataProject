Thirty males were assigned to HR (n = 10), MR (n = 10), or control (C; n = 10) groups. Resistance training was performed for eight weeks. Activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), creatine kinase (CK), and concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) were measured before and after training in plasma. The results show increased SOD activity in MR (p = 0.026) and HR (p = 0.044) groups. GPX activity in HR (p = 0.012) and MR (p = 0.037) increased significantly more than in C. Whilst a significant reduction in MDA in MR (p = 0.013) and HR (p = 0.023) was observed compared with C, no significant difference in IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and CK occurred between groups. We conclude that changes in enzymatic antioxidant defense and inflammatory markers following resistance training are independent of training intensity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4da3cf058f610001673","authors":["Kamal Azizbeigi","Mohammad Ali Azarbayjani","Sirvan Atashak","Stephen R Stannard","Azizbeigi K","Azarbayjani MA","Atashak S","Stannard SR","Stephen R.
