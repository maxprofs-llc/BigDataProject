Here, four in-depth human platelet proteomic datasets were generated to explore potential new functions for platelets based on their protein content and this led to the identification of 2,559 high confidence proteins. During a more detailed analysis consistently high expression of the proteasome was discovered, and the composition and function of this complex, whose role in platelets has not been thoroughly investigated, was examined. Dataset mining resulted in identification of nearly all members of the 26S proteasome in one or more datasets, except the \u03b25 subunit. However, \u03b25i, a component of the immunoproteasome, was identified. Biochemical analyses confirmed the presence of all catalytically active subunits of the standard 20S proteasome and immunoproteasome in human platelets, including \u03b25, which was predominantly found in its precursor form. It was demonstrated that these components were assembled into the proteasome complex and that standard proteasome as well as immunoproteasome subunits were constitutively active in platelets. These findings suggest potential new roles for platelets in the immune system. For example, the immunoproteasome may be involved in MHC (major histocompatibility complex) I peptide generation, as the MHC I machinery was also identified in our datasets.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081d9","authors":["Cordula Klockenbusch","Geraldine M.
