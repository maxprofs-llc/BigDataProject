Our previous research revealed membrane injury induces cleavage of dysferlin to release a synaptotagmin-like C-terminal module we termed mini-dysferlinC72. Herein we show injury-activated cleavage of dysferlin is mediated by the ubiquitous calpains, via a cleavage motif encoded by alternately-spliced exon 40a. An Exon 40a-specific antibody recognizing cleaved mini-dysferlinC72 intensely labels the circumference of injury sites, supporting a key role for dysferlinExon40a isoforms in membrane repair, and consistent with our evidence suggesting the calpain-cleaved C-terminal module is the form specifically recruited to injury sites. Calpain cleavage of dysferlin is a ubiquitous response to membrane injury in multiple cell lineages, and occurs independently of the membrane repair protein MG53. Our study links calpain and dysferlin in the calcium-activated vesicle fusion of membrane repair, placing calpains as upstream mediators of a membrane repair cascade that elicits cleaved dysferlin as an effector. Importantly, we reveal myoferlin and otoferlin are also cleaved enzymatically to release similar C-terminal modules, bearing two C2 domains and transmembrane domain. Evolutionary preservation of this feature highlights its functional importance, and suggests this highly conserved C-terminal region of ferlins represents a functionally specialised vesicle fusion module.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c7","authors":["GMI Redpath","N Woolger","AK Piper","FA Lemckert","A Lek","PA Greer","KN North","ST Cooper","Redpath G","Woolger N","Piper A","Lemckert F","Lek A","Greer P","North K","Cooper S","G.
