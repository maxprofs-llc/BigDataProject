Study results have shown that the use of MAP, in conjunction with the ANC\/OMP, has proven to be safe and effective by preventing those adverse effects associated with a negative nitrogen balance, such as oversized or flabby tissue, stretch marks, sagging of breast tissue, increased hair loss, faded hair color, and fragile or brittle nails. Also preventing those anomalies commonly associated with weight-loss diets, such as hunger, weakness, headache caused by ketosis, constipation, or decreased libido, the use of MAP, in conjunction with the ANC\/OMP, allowed for mean weight loss of 1.4 kg (3 lb) per week.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f6100068d9","authors":["Luc\u00e0-Moretti M","Grandi A","Luc\u00e0 E","Muratori G","Nofroni MG","Mucci MP","Gambetta P","Stimolo R","Drago P","Giudice G","Tamburlin N"],"first_seen_on":"2014-08-21T02:49:45+00:00","issns":["0741-238X"],"issue":"5","journal":"Advances in Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1498728102,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14964348","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?Db=PubMed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=14964348&ordinalpos=1&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/14964348\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/14964348\/?i=5&from=luca%20moretti","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14964348"],"pmid":"14964348","pubdate":"2004-02-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Master Amino acid Pattern as substitute for dietary proteins during a weight-loss diet to achieve the body's nitrogen balance equilibrium with essentially no calories.","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/master-amino-acid-pattern-sole-total-substitute-dietary-proteins-during-weightloss-diet-achieve-body"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.25,"score_history":{"1y":9.25,"6m":9.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8440126,"mean":7.0979478654558,"rank":660415,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7776882,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8440126,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187270,"mean":7.7472796885766,"rank":17461,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":169717,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187270,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":782,"mean":4.994304737516,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":756,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":782,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.2119047619048,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Post Doc":1,"Ph.D. Student":1,"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)":1,"Student (Postgraduate)":1,"Student (Bachelor)":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine":3,"Humanities":1,"Earth Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Master Amino acid Pattern as substitute for...
