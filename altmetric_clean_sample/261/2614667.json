However, the mechanisms underlying ROS production during neuropathic pain processing are not fully understood. We here detected the ROS-generating NADPH oxidase isoform Nox2 in macrophages of dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) in mice. In response to peripheral nerve injury, Nox2-positive macrophages were recruited to DRGs, and ROS production was increased in a Nox2-dependent manner. Nox2-deficient mice displayed reduced neuropathic pain behavior after peripheral nerve injury, whereas their immediate responses to noxious stimuli were normal. Moreover, injury-induced upregulation of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 was absent and ATF3-induction was reduced in DRGs of Nox2-deficient mice suggesting an attenuated macrophage-neuron signaling. These data suggest that Nox2-dependent ROS production in macrophages recruited to DRGs contributes to neuropathic pain hypersensitivity, underlining the observation that Nox-derived ROS exert specific functions during the processing of pain.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003281","authors":["Wiebke Kallenborn-Gerhardt","Stephan W Hohmann","Katharina M J Syhr","Katrin Schr\u00f6der","Marco Sisignano","Andreas Weigert","Jana E Lorenz","Ruirui Lu","Bernhard Br\u00fcne","Ralf P Brandes","Gerd Geisslinger","Achim Schmidtko"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pain.2014.08.013","first_seen_on":"2014-08-21T10:17:59+00:00","issns":["1872-6623"],"journal":"Pain (03043959)","last_mentioned_on":1408616270,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25139590"],"pmid":"25139590","pubdate":"2014-08-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"Nox2-dependent signaling between macrophages and sensory neurons contributes to neuropathic pain hypersensitivity.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nox2dependent-signaling-between-macrophages-sensory-neurons-contributes-neuropathic-pain-hypersensit"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":2295436,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1618749,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113792,"mean":7.9852877995625,"rank":55330,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":44411,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113792,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2423,"mean":5.5879132947977,"rank":1534,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":603,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2423,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82,"mean":5.622987654321,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
