Aging alters a broad spectrum of physiological, endocrine, and behavioral rhythms. Although recent evidence suggests that cellular aging contributes to various age-associated diseases, its effects on the circadian rhythms have not been examined. We report here that cellular senescence impairs circadian rhythmicity both in vitro and in vivo. Circadian expression of clock genes in serum-stimulated senescent cells was significantly weaker compared with that in young cells. Introduction of telomerase completely prevented this reduction of clock gene expression associated with senescence. Stimulation by serum activated the cAMP response element-binding protein, but the activation of this signaling pathway was significantly weaker in senescent cells. Treatment with activators of this pathway effectively restored the impaired clock gene expression of senescent cells. When young cells were implanted into young mice or old mice, the implanted cells were effectively entrained by the circadian rhythm of the recipients. In contrast, the entrainment of implanted senescent cells was markedly impaired. These results suggest that senescence decreases the ability of cells to transmit circadian signals to their clocks and that regulation of clock gene expression may be a novel strategy for the treatment of age-associated impairment of circadian rhythmicity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006ec9","authors":["Takeshige Kunieda","Tohru Minamino","Taro Katsuno","Kaoru Tateno","Jun-ichiro Nishi","Hideyuki Miyauchi","Masayuki Orimo","Sho Okada","Issei Komuro"],"doi":"10.1161\/01.res.0000204504.25798.a8","first_seen_on":"2014-08-20T22:25:23+00:00","issns":["1524-4571"],"journal":"Circulation Research (Highwire)","last_mentioned_on":1408573454,"links":["http:\/\/circres.ahajournals.org\/content\/98\/4\/532.long"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/circres.ahajournals.org\/content\/98\/4\/532.full.pdf","pmid":"16424366","pubdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Cellular Senescence Impairs Circadian Expression of Clock Genes In Vitro and In Vivo","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cellular-senescence-impairs-circadian-expression-clock-genes-vitro-vivo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4160556,"mean":5.1186932102572,"rank":3328280,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":106855,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4160556,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107047,"mean":8.0908472058741,"rank":85381,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":416,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107047,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2008,"mean":2.893860488291,"rank":1721,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2008,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":6.515625,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":11,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
