Recently, the nonselective \u03b2-adrenergic-blocker propranolol has been shown to be a safe and effective means of treating IHs, although its mechanism has yet to be elucidated. We have previously demonstrated that propranolol induces early and incomplete adipogenesis in stem cells derived from hemangiomas. We hypothesize that propranolol promotes dysregulated adipogenesis via the improper regulation of adipogenic genes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a2c","authors":["England RW","Hardy KL","Kitajewski AM","Wong A","Kitajewski JK","Shawber CJ","Wu JK"],"doi":"10.1097\/sap.0000000000000272","endpage":"S124","first_seen_on":"2014-08-22T10:37:50+00:00","funders":["nhlbi","nci"],"issns":["0148-7043"],"journal":"Annals of Plastic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1408703839,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/annalsplasticsurgery\/Abstract\/2014\/09001\/Propranolol_Promotes_Accelerated_and_Dysregulated.22.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/annalsplasticsurgery\/2014\/09001\/Propranolol_Promotes_Accelerated_and_Dysregulated.22.pdf","pmid":"25115372","pubdate":"2014-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"S119","subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Propranolol Promotes Accelerated and Dysregulated Adipogenesis in Hemangioma Stem Cells","type":"article","volume":"73","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/propranolol-promotes-accelerated-dysregulated-adipogenesis-hemangioma-stem-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":4199383,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":129666,"mean":8.4312744996724,"rank":104278,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":129666,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1961,"mean":1.0118602040816,"rank":1205,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1961,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86,"mean":0.81823529411765,"rank":73,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AnnalsofPlSrgy\/status\/502766458393202689","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2618019],"posted_on":"2014-08-22T10:37:19+00:00","author":{"name":"APSOnlineJrl","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1611398882\/APS_Cover_-_Twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Editor-in-Chief: William C.
