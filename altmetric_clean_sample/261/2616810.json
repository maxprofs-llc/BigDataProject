The preparation of these materials in 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium trifluoromethylsulfonate, [Py1,4]TfO, at 100\u2009\u00b0C with FeCl2 and FeCl2 +SiCl4 was studied by using cyclic voltammetry. Constant-potential electrolysis was carried out to deposit either Fe or FeSi, and deposits of approximately 10 \u03bcm thicknesses were obtained. By using scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, the microstructure and crystallinity of the deposits were investigated. Grain sizes in the nanometer regime (50-80 nm) were found and the presence of iron-silicon alloys was verified. Frequency-dependent magnetic polarizations, coercive forces, and power losses of some deposits were determined by using a digital hysteresis recorder. Corresponding to the small grain sizes, the coercive forces are around 950-1150 A\u2009m(-1) and the power losses were at 6000 J\u2009m(-3), which is much higher than in commercial Fe(3.2 wt\u2009%)Si electrical steel. Below a polarization of 1.8 T, the power losses are mainly caused by domain wall movements and, above 1.8 T, by rotation of magnetic moments as well as domain wall annihilation and recreation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008dda","authors":["Giridhar, Pulletikurthi","Weidenfeller, Bernd","Zein El Abedin, Sherif","Endres, Frank"],"doi":"10.1002\/cphc.201402406","endpage":"3522","first_seen_on":"2014-08-22T00:34:29+00:00","issns":["1439-7641","1439-4235"],"issue":"16","journal":"ChemPhysChem","last_mentioned_on":1408667584,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cphc.201402406\/abstract;jsessionid=BBA482064A01AC746A30B37A962FB06B.f03t03"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cphc.201402406\/pdf","pmid":"25146175","pubdate":"2014-08-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
