As disease entities among infants with ILD are often distinct from forms seen in older children and adults, the guideline encourages an age-based classification system and focuses on the diagnostic approach to neonates and infants <2 years of age. The guideline reviews current evidence and recommendations for the evaluation, relevant genetic studies, and management of symptomatic infants. Here, we summarize the ATS guideline, highlight the major concepts, and discuss future strategies aimed at addressing current gaps in knowledge.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073da","authors":["Jennifer A Wambach"],"doi":"10.1586\/17476348.2014.951334","first_seen_on":"2014-08-21T03:28:54+00:00","issns":["1747-6348"],"journal":"Expert Review of Respiratory Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1408591661,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1586\/17476348.2014.951334","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1586\/17476348.2014.951334"],"pmid":"25138715","pubdate":"2014-08-19T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"New clinical practice guidelines on the classification, evaluation and management of childhood interstitial lung disease in infants: what do they mean?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-clinical-practice-guidelines-classification-evaluation-management-childhood-interstitial-lung-di"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4753128,"mean":5.7096514345228,"rank":3978314,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4753128,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120859,"mean":8.3788634265007,"rank":96762,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120859,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":218,"mean":1.7744239631336,"rank":153,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":218,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.2142857142857,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
