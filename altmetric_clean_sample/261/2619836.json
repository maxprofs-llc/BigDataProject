Moreover, in older persons, obesity can exacerbate the age-related decline in physical function and lead to frailty. However, appropriate treatment for obesity in older persons is controversial because of the reduction in relative health risks associated with increasing body mass index and the concern that weight loss could have potential harmful effects in the older population. This joint position statement from the American Society for Nutrition and the NAASO, The Obesity Society reviews the clinical issues related to obesity in older persons and provides health professionals with appropriate weight-management guidelines for obese older patients. The current data show that weight-loss therapy improves physical function, quality of life, and the medical complications associated with obesity in older persons. Therefore, weight-loss therapy that minimizes muscle and bone losses is recommended for older persons who are obese and who have functional impairments or medical complications that can benefit from weight loss.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005700","authors":["Dennis T Villareal","Caroline M Apovian","Robert F Kushner","Samuel Klein"],"first_seen_on":"2014-08-22T19:07:54+00:00","issns":["1938-3207","0002-9165"],"issue":"5","journal":"American Journal of Clinical Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1489539278,"links":["http:\/\/ajcn.nutrition.org\/content\/82\/5\/923.full.pdf+html?sid=dbffc42b-257e-437b-aeb6-e6dc7cc558d5","http:\/\/m.ajcn.nutrition.org\/content\/82\/5\/923.full","http:\/\/ajcn.nutrition.org\/content\/82\/5\/923.full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ajcn.nutrition.org\/content\/82\/5\/923.full.pdf","pmid":"16280421","pubdate":"2005-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Obesity in older adults: technical review and position statement of the American Society for Nutrition and NAASO, The Obesity Society","type":"article","volume":"82","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/obesity-older-adults-technical-review-position-statement-american-society-nutrition-naaso-obesity-so"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.6,"score_history":{"1y":2.6,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8360145,"mean":7.0505745135414,"rank":1742166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6610357,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8360145,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186409,"mean":7.7625984507105,"rank":39477,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":146660,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186409,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6022,"mean":27.162118917123,"rank":3305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":2709,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6022,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":21.48023255814,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":19,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":37,"Student  > Doctoral Student":23,"Student  > Ph.
