However, two major hurdles still remain in the structural biology of membrane proteins. One is the inability to obtain large amounts of protein for crystallization and the other is the failure to get well-diffracting crystals. With single particle electron cryomicroscopy, both these problems can be overcome and high-resolution structures of membrane proteins and other labile protein complexes can be obtained with very little protein and without the need for crystals. In this review, I highlight recent advances in electron microscopy, detectors and software, which have allowed determination of medium to high-resolution structures of membrane proteins and complexes that have been difficult to study by other structural biological techniques.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026aa","authors":["Vinothkumar, Kutti R"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.sbi.2015.07.009","endpage":"114","first_seen_on":"2016-07-03T18:56:40+00:00","funders":["mrc"],"issns":["1879-033X","0959440X"],"journal":"Current Opinion in Structural Biology","last_mentioned_on":1467513950,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0959440X15001074"],"pmid":"26435463","pubdate":"2015-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Artificial Intelligence And Image Processing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"103","subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Membrane protein structures without crystals, by single particle electron cryomicroscopy","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/membrane-protein-structures-without-crystals-single-particle-electron-cryomicroscopy-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7981790,"mean":6.7349664530035,"rank":4189999,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2229825,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7981790,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260389,"mean":11.502429904604,"rank":141452,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":93005,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260389,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":717,"mean":2.791625698324,"rank":463,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":192,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":717,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":1.8107142857143,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
