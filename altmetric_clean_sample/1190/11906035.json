In the current study, we investigated the effect of \u03b1-GalCer against Bacillus anthracis infection, the agent of anthrax. Using an experimental model of s.c. B. anthracis infection (an encapsulated nontoxigenic strain), we show that concomitant administration of \u03b1-GalCer delayed B. anthracis systemic dissemination and prolonged mouse survival. Depletion of subcapsular sinus CD169-positive macrophages by clodronate-containing liposome was associated with a lack of iNKT cell activation in the draining lymph nodes (dLNs) and prevented the protective effect of \u03b1-GalCer on bacterial dissemination out of the dLNs. Production of IFN-\u03b3 triggered chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3 synthesis and recruitment of neutrophils in the dLNs, leading to the restraint of B. anthracis dissemination. Our data highlight a novel immunological pathway leading to the control of B. anthracis infection, a finding that might lead to improved therapeutics based on iNKT cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cc7","authors":["Mathieu Le Gars","Michel Haustant","Maria Klezovich-B\u00e9nard","Christophe Paget","Fran\u00e7ois Trottein","Pierre L.
