Sixty-three women underwent a three-week PNE using a tined lead and the Verify(\u00ae) external neurostimulator. The primary outcome was efficacy defined as the percent of reduction in weekly FI episodes, and patients with 50% or more reduction were defined as responders. Baseline factors affecting the primary outcome were explored. Sphincter defects were classified with a validated 3D endoanal ultrasound defect score.\nFifty-six (89%) of the 63 women were responders with a reduction in weekly FI episodes of 94.5%, from median (interquartile range) 4.8 (2.0-11.0) to 0.5 (0-2.0, p<0.001). Twenty-nine (52%) reported no weekly FI episodes, and urgency episodes disappeared in 18 (32%). In the multivariable linear regression model, efficacy was related to concomitant urinary incontinence (p=0.04), body mass index (BMI) (p=0.03) and pain during PNE (p=0.046) but not to the extent of sphincter defect (p= 0.1). Responders had a higher St. Mark's score than non-responders (p=0.046).\nThe vast majority of women had successful PNE tests. Responders had higher baseline St. Mark's scores than non-responders. Efficacy was related to concomitant urinary incontinence, BMI and pain, not to the extent of sphincter defect. This article is protected by copyright.
