We tested whether a \"light\" color and a \"low-calorie\" descriptor on food packages gain favorable consumer perception ratings as compared with regular packages. Our online experiment recruited 406 adults in a 3 (product type: Chips versus Juice versus Yoghurt)\u2009\u00d7\u20092 (descriptor type: regular versus low-calorie)\u2009\u00d7\u20092 (color type: regular versus light) mixed design. Dependent variables were sensory (evaluations of the product's nutritional value and quality), product-based (evaluations of the product's physical appeal), and consumer-based (evaluations of the potential consumers of the product) scales. \"Low-calorie\" descriptors were found to increase sensory ratings as compared with regular descriptors and light-colored packages received higher product-based ratings as compared with their regular-colored counterparts. Food package color and descriptors present a promising venue for understanding preventative measures against obesity.[Formula: see text].","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e3f","authors":["Al-Hamdani, Mohammed","Smith, Steven"],"doi":"10.1080\/09637486.2016.1226274","endpage":"7","first_seen_on":"2016-09-08T20:27:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1465-3478","0963-7486"],"journal":"International Journal of Food Sciences & Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1473366409,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/09637486.2016.1226274?journalCode=iijf20"],"pmid":"27580635","pubdate":"2016-08-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Food product design: emerging evidence for food policy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/food-product-design-emerging-evidence-food-policy-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8348788,"mean":7.0413328717018,"rank":7217863,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8348788,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252659,"mean":12.463522136643,"rank":210704,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252659,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":674,"mean":9.0375928677563,"rank":574,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":674,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":9.0632,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
