The use of naturally derived materials might become a more promising concept, not only as directly acting antimicrobials, but also for stimulation of the immune system. Costa Rican plant extracts were screened for their ability to enhance the antimicrobial activity of human blood-derived cells against S. aureus infections. We identified three plant extracts which significantly reduced the growth of S. aureus in the presence of human blood without directly acting as antibacterials: Byrsonima crassifolia acetone bark extract, Mandevilla veraguasensis acetone vine extract and Verbesina oerstediana acetone bark extract (VEOEBA). The effect of VEOEBA was studied in more detail, and revealed that VEOEBA increases the antimicrobial activity of neutrophils by enhancing the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps.","altmetric_jid":"56b367f52a83eea9718b45d4","authors":["Ragheda Yaseen","Katja Branitzki-Heinemann","Hani Moubasher","William Setzer","Hassan Naim","Maren von K\u00f6ckritz-Blickwede"],"doi":"10.3390\/biomedicines5030040","first_seen_on":"2017-07-31T10:10:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2227-9059"],"issue":"3","journal":"Biomedicines","last_mentioned_on":1501495846,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2227-9059\/5\/3\/40"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2227-9059\/5\/3\/40\/pdf","pmid":"28678207","pubdate":"2017-07-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","title":"In Vitro Testing of Crude Natural Plant Extracts from Costa Rica for Their Ability to Boost Innate Immune Cells against Staphylococcus aureus","type":"article","volume":"5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8302052,"mean":6.9984430163018,"rank":4419414,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2311235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8302052,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171469,"mean":11.596175134719,"rank":93639,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":61074,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171469,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73,"mean":7.9258055555556,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.6,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CN":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Biomed_MDPI\/statuses\/891964345466273793","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23315761],"posted_on":"2017-07-31T10:10:46+00:00","author":{"name":"Biomedicines","url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/journal\/biomedicines","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/850234094269022208\/zB98xPID_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"Biomed_MDPI","tweeter_id":"850232583187177472","geo":{"lt":35,"ln":105,"country":"CN"},"followers":12},"tweet_id":"891964345466273793"}]}}
