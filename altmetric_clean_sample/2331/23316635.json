Here we report a novel proteinaceous hybrid matrix mimicking bone extracellular matrix that has multifunctional capacity to promote stem cell adhesion and osteogenesis with excellent stability. Osteocalcin-fibronectin fusion protein holding collagen binding domain was networked with fibrillar collagen, featuring bone extracellular matrix mimic, to provide multifunctional and structurally-stable biomatrices. The hybrid protein, integrated homogeneously with collagen fibrillar networks, preserved structural stability over a month. Biological efficacy of the hybrid matrix was proven onto tethered surface of biopolymer porous scaffolds. Mesenchymal stem cells quickly anchored to the hybrid matrix, forming focal adhesions, and substantially conformed to cytoskeletal extensions, benefited from the fibronectin adhesive domains. Cells achieved high proliferative capacity to reach confluence rapidly and switched to a mature and osteogenic phenotype more effectively, resulting in greater osteogenic matrix syntheses and mineralization, driven by the engineered osteocalcin. The hybrid biomimetic matrix significantly improved in\u00a0vivo bone formation in calvarial defects over 6 weeks. Based on the series of stimulated biological responses in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo the novel hybrid proteinaceous composition will be potentially useful as stem cell interfacing matrices for osteogenesis and bone regeneration.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023e8","authors":["Won, JE","Yun, YR","Jang, JH","Yang, SH","Kim, JH","Chrzanowski, W","Wall, IB","Knowles, JC","Kim, HW"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.biomaterials.2015.03.022","first_seen_on":"2017-07-31T11:22:24+00:00","issns":["01429612"],"journal":"Biomaterials","last_mentioned_on":1501500133,"links":["http:\/\/discovery.ucl.ac.uk\/1468421\/"],"pmid":"25934278","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Multifunctional and stable bone mimic proteinaceous matrix for bone tissue engineering","type":"article","volume":"56","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multifunctional-stable-bone-mimic-proteinaceous-matrix-bone-tissue-engineering"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8302353,"mean":6.9982161057411,"rank":7178747,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8302353,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171520,"mean":11.592845154181,"rank":140118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171520,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2597,"mean":6.1039152542373,"rank":1866,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2597,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127,"mean":1.8788571428571,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
