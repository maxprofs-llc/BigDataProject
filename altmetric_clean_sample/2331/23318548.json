To evaluate the incidence of subsequent thrombosis among women diagnosed with purely obstetric APS. We retrospectively reviewed and collected demographic and clinical data from the computerized charts of all patients with obstetric APS, from 1992 to 2017. Eligibility criteria included all women diagnosed with APS, according to the 2006 revised criteria, for whom the clinical manifestations were purely obstetric. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of subsequent thromboembolic events, following diagnosis of obstetric APS. The study included 115 women diagnosed with obstetric APS. During the study's follow up period, 12 (10.4%) women developed thrombosis. Of the 12 women who developed thrombosis, 9 (75%) of the thrombotic events were arterial. The site of arterial thrombosis was cerebral in all cases. Venous thrombosis occurred in 3 (25%) women, including one in each of the following sites-pulmonary embolism, ovarian vein thrombosis and proximal leg deep vein thrombosis. Our data suggests that women with obstetric APS are at risk for subsequent long-term thrombosis, especially arterial cerebral events. We did not identify any clinical or laboratory unique features among women with obstetric APS who will eventually develop thrombosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007efd","authors":["Drozidnsky, Genady","Hadar, Eran","Shmueli, Anat","Gabbay-Benziv, Rinat","Shiber, Shachaf","Genady Drozidnsky","Eran Hadar","Anat Shmueli","Rinat Gabbay-Benziv","Shachaf Shiber"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11239-017-1526-9","first_seen_on":"2017-07-31T13:28:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0929-5305","1573-742X"],"journal":"Journal of Thrombosis and Thrombolysis","last_mentioned_on":1502061456,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28748519?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28748519\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s11239-017-1526-9","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/s11239-017-1526-9"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs11239-017-1526-9.pdf","pmid":"28748519","pubdate":"2017-07-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Hematology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome and long term arterial thrombosis risk","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/obstetric-antiphospholipid-syndrome-long-term-arterial-thrombosis-risk"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.7,"score_history":{"1y":5.7,"6m":5.7,"3m":5.7,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8331095,"mean":7.02255168024,"rank":1488050,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":6837490,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8331095,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185942,"mean":12.079547318773,"rank":42064,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":143631,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185942,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275,"mean":2.9594452554745,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":250,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":6.35,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Unspecified":5}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":3,"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/APSsupportUK\/statuses\/892014154818736129","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23318548],"posted_on":"2017-07-31T13:28:41+00:00","author":{"name":"APS Support UK","url":"http:\/\/www.aps-support.org.uk","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/798462331642662912\/4yxdm2QL_normal.jpg","description":"APS Support UK is dedicated to raising awareness of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), supporting anyone affected by the condition and furthering research.","id_on_source":"APSsupportUK","tweeter_id":"485842814","geo":{"lt":51.26249,"ln":-1.08708,"country":"GB"},"followers":1513},"tweet_id":"892014154818736129"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/APSFA\/statuses\/892044226728480772","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23318548],"posted_on":"2017-07-31T15:28:11+00:00","author":{"name":"APS Fndn of America","url":"http:\/\/www.apsfa.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/328582648\/twitterProfilePhoto_normal.jpg","description":"APS Foundation of America, Inc ( #APSFA ) is the only US organization spreading #Antiphospholipid Syndrome #APS & #Lupus #Awareness!  #DVT #PE #Stroke #APS","id_on_source":"APSFA","tweeter_id":"17492469","geo":{"lt":39.76,"ln":-98.5,"country":"US"},"followers":1489},"tweet_id":"892044226728480772"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/eyzrbrn\/statuses\/892044324468379648","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23318548],"posted_on":"2017-07-31T15:28:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Tina \ud83d\ude0a\u270c\u2744 \u2764\ud83d\udc31 \ud83d\udca6\ud83c\udf1e\u267b\ufe0f","url":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Tina.M.Pohlman","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/865967190025142273\/qflPBQIA_normal.jpg","description":"#Lupus, #APS, #RA & #CKD suck. #Paranormal Junkie!
