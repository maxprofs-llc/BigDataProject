However, significantly more patients who started with free-drug combinations remained therapy persistent (56.4%), resulting in an OR of 2.00 (95% CI 1.6 to 2.5; p<0.0001) for free combinations versus fixed combinations. This trend was observed in all age groups and for men and women. At the end of the study period, the number of different antihypertensive agents was still similar between patients who started with a fixed combination (2.41) and patients who started with a free combination (2.28).\nWhile single-pill combinations make it easier to take different drugs at once, the risk is high that these several substances are stopped at once. Therapy persistence was significantly better for patients who started with a free-drug combination without taking much fewer different antihypertensive drugs as those with a fixed combination.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cc0","authors":["Thomas Grimmsmann","Wolfgang Himmel"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmjopen-2016-011650","first_seen_on":"2016-11-24T08:34:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2044-6055"],"issue":"11","journal":"BMJ Open","last_mentioned_on":1484053818,"links":["http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/6\/11\/e011650.full","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/bmjopen-2016-011650"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/6\/11\/e011650.full.pdf","pmid":"27881519","pubdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"British Medical Journal Publishing Group","startpage":"e011650","title":"Comparison of therapy persistence for fixed versus free combination antihypertensives: a retrospective cohort study","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-therapy-persistence-fi-xed-versus-free-combination-antihypertensives-retrospective-cohort"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.25,"score_history":{"1y":9.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8038089,"mean":6.8236667777181,"rank":878614,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7147946,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8038089,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261047,"mean":12.12181885185,"rank":43546,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":216789,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261047,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5733,"mean":16.878978018144,"rank":1619,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":4097,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5733,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":413,"mean":23.77940776699,"rank":123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":289,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":413,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Bluthochdruck: Freie Kombination schl\u00e4gt Fixkombi","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=29184283003&p=1pl&v=1&x=yL9Bb9Zytn33jCzCB64cwA","license":"public","citation_ids":[13966495],"posted_on":"2017-01-10T13:10:18+00:00","summary":"Bislang ging man immer davon aus, dass Patienten lieber ein Kombinationspr\u00e4parat einnehmen statt zwei einzelne Medikamente.","author":{"name":"Pharmazeutische Zeitung","url":"http:\/\/www.pharmazeutische-zeitung.de\/","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/001\/040\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2014-07-17_at_11.38.10.png?1405593576"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/FarmaciaOesteAP\/statuses\/801705475721019393","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13966495],"posted_on":"2016-11-24T08:34:15+00:00","author":{"name":"Farmacia AP DAOeste","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/815853302097309696\/Hunxmo0j_normal.jpg","description":"Farmac\u00e9utic@s de atenci\u00f3n primaria de la Direcci\u00f3n Asistencial Oeste del Servicio Madrile\u00f1o de Salud.
