This paper aims to refresh the information base of AOPs and to discover the research gaps of AOPs in landfill leachate treatment. A brief overview of mechanisms involving in AOPs including ozone-based AOPs, hydrogen peroxide-based AOPs and persulfate-based AOPs are presented, and the parameters affecting AOPs are elaborated. Particularly, the advancement of AOPs in landfill leachate treatment is compared and discussed. Landfill leachate characterization prior to method selection and method optimization prior to treatment are necessary, as the performance and practicability of AOPs are influenced by leachate matrixes and treatment cost. More studies concerning the scavenging effects of leachate matrixes towards AOPs, as well as the persulfate-based AOPs in landfill leachate treatment, are necessary in the future.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003716","authors":["Kow, Su-Huan"],"doi":"10.2175\/106143016x14733681695285","first_seen_on":"2016-10-30T07:56:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1061-4303"],"issue":"11","journal":"Water Environment Research (10614303)","last_mentioned_on":1477814137,"links":["http:\/\/www.ingentaconnect.com\/content\/wef\/wer\/2016\/00000088\/00000011\/art00010"],"pmid":"28661323","pubdate":"2017-06-30T22:03:20+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Advanced Oxidation Processes: Process Mechanisms, Affecting Parameters and Landfill Leachate Treatment","type":"article","volume":"88","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/advanced-oxidation-processes-process-mechanisms-affecting-parameters-landfill-leachate-treatment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8067612,"mean":6.8456703323907,"rank":6986161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8067612,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240316,"mean":12.971414410253,"rank":196896,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240316,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":472,"mean":1.1069129511677,"rank":227,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":472,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":1.0840476190476,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
