However, whether metformin has an effect on the stromal reaction of PDAC remains unknown. In this study, we first evaluated the expression of AMPK and phosphorylated-AMPK (P-AMPK) in normal and PDAC tissues, our data indicate that reduced P-AMPK expression is a frequent event in PDAC and correlated with poor prognosis and the dense stromal reaction. We then determined the efficacy of metformin on PDAC growth in vitro and in vivo. We reveal that metformin reduces the production of fibrogenic cytokines from pancreatic cancer cells (PCs) and inhibits paracrine-mediated pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) activation under PCs-PSCs co-culture conditions. By using a xenograft PDAC mouse model, we show that metformin intervention prevents tumor growth and enhances the antitumor effect of gemcitabine via suppression of desmoplastic reaction. Taken together, these results suggest that induction of AMPK activation by metformin represents a novel therapeutic approach for treating advanced PDAC through reducing the desmoplastic reaction in PDAC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000249e","authors":["Duan, Wanxing","Chen, Ke","Jiang, Zhengdong","Chen, Xin","Sun, Liankang","Li, Jiahui","Lei, Jianjun","Xu, Qinhong","Ma, Jiguang","Li, Xuqi","Han, Liang","Wang, Zheng","Wu, Zheng","Wang, Fengfei","Wu, Erxi","Ma, Qingyong","Ma, Zhenhua"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.canlet.2016.10.019","first_seen_on":"2016-10-30T08:51:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1872-7980","03043835"],"journal":"Cancer Letters","last_mentioned_on":1477827439,"links":["http:\/\/www.cancerletters.info\/article\/S0304-3835(16)30639-5\/abstract"],"pmid":"27773749","pubdate":"2016-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Desmoplasia suppression by metformin-mediated AMPK activation inhibits pancreatic cancer progression","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/desmoplasia-suppression-metforminmediated-ampk-activation-inhibits-pancreatic-cancer-progression"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7621460,"mean":6.5607387299425,"rank":5495358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1854889,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7621460,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234316,"mean":12.737260072979,"rank":151007,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":72342,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234316,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1787,"mean":3.2861287793953,"rank":1137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":599,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1787,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":18.088181818182,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
