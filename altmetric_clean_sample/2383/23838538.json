Although much progress has been made in elucidating UVB perception and signalling pathways under controlled laboratory conditions, understanding of the adaptive, ecological role of UVB responses is still very limited. In this study, we looked at the functional role of UVR8 under outdoor light conditions, by studying growth, photosynthetic competence and accumulation of UV absorbing pigments in a mutant lacking functional UVR8 protein. It was found that the influence of UVB on morphology is restricted to the summer, and is independent of UVR8. In contrast, UVB had an effect on the content of UV-absorbing pigments and the maximal efficiency of photosystem II of photosynthesis in the uvr8-1 mutant throughout the year. It is concluded that the UVR8 photoreceptor plays a role throughout the year, in the temperate climate zone, even when UVB levels are relatively low.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003340","authors":["Coffey, A.","Prinsen, E.","Jansen, M.A.K.","Conway, J."],"doi":"10.1111\/pce.13025","first_seen_on":"2017-08-15T07:10:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["01407791","1365-3040"],"journal":"Plant, Cell & Environment","last_mentioned_on":1502781009,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/pce.13025\/full\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/pce.13025\/pdf","pmid":"28710809","pubdate":"2017-08-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","botany"],"title":"The UVB photoreceptor UVR8 mediates accumulation of UV-absorbing pigments, but not changes in plant morphology, under outdoor conditions","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/uvb-photoreceptor-uvr8-mediates-accumulation-uvabsorbing-pigments-not-changes-plant-morphology-under"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8380241,"mean":7.0622268827546,"rank":4472489,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2332139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8380241,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":181201,"mean":12.380652737307,"rank":99507,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":63863,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":181201,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1212,"mean":2.8129843104872,"rank":555,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":487,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1212,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":1.9680555555556,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
