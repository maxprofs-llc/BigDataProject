The chemical activation using KOH, however, could lead to broad distribution of pores originating from the simultaneous pore deepening and widening pathways. Accordingly, establishing correlation between the chemical\/textural properties of starting porous\/nonporous materials and various pore formation mechanisms is quite critical to realize superior porosity and gas uptake properties. Here, we show that the chemical and textural properties of starting porous organic polymers, that is covalent triazine frameworks (CTF), have profound effect on the resulting porosity of the frameworks. The chemical activation of microporous CTF-1 using KOH at 700\u00b0C enabled the preparation of chemically activated CTF-1, caCTF-1-700, which predominantly showed pore deepening leading to an increased surface area of 2367 m2 g-1 and significantly enhanced gas adsorption properties with CO2 uptake capacities up to 6.0 mmol g-1 at 1 bar and 1.45 mmol g-1 at 0.15 bar, 273 K along with a isosteric heats of adsorption (Qst) of 30.6 kJ mol-1. In addition, a remarkable H2 uptake capacity of 2.46 and 1.66 wt% at 77 and 87 K, 1 bar along with the Qst value of 10.95 kJ mol-1 at zero coverage was also observed for the caCTF-1-700. Notably, the activation of mesoporous CTF-2 under the same conditions accompanied by a decrease in its surface area and also in the conversion of mesopores into the micropores, thus leading to a pore deepening\/narrowing rather than widening. We attributed this result to the presence of reactive weak spots, triazine moieties, for the chemical activation reaction within the CTF backbone. These results collectively suggest the critical role of chemical and pore characteristics of porous organic polymers in chemical activation to realize solid-sorbents for high capacity gas storage applications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f61000680f","authors":["Yoon Jeong Lee","Siddulu Naidu Talapaneni","Ali Coskun"],"doi":"10.1021\/acsami.7b08930","first_seen_on":"2017-08-15T07:08:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1944-8244","1944-8252"],"journal":"ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces","last_mentioned_on":1502788203,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acsami.7b08930#.WZKdu3jYRtg.twitter"],"pmid":"28782930","publisher":" American Chemical Society ","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Macromolecular And Materials Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
