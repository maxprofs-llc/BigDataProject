Previous studies suggested that alterations in intestinal motility and permeability contribute to the development of NAFLD. Serotonin and serotonin receptor type 3 (5-HT(3)R) are key factors in the regulation of intestinal motility and permeability. Therefore, we studied the effect of the 5-HT(3)R antagonists tropisetron and palonosetron on the development of NAFLD in leptin-deficient obese mice. Four-week-old ob\/ob mice and lean controls were treated for 6 weeks orally with tropisetron or palonosetron at 0.2 mg\/kg per day. We determined markers of liver damage and inflammation, portal endotoxin levels, and duodenal concentrations of serotonin, serotonin-reuptake transporter (SERT), occludin, and claudin-1. Tropisetron treatment significantly reduced liver fat content (-29%), liver inflammation (-56%), and liver cell necrosis (-59%) in ob\/ob mice. The beneficial effects of tropisetron were accompanied by a decrease in plasma alanine aminotransferase and portal vein plasma endotoxin levels, an attenuation of enhanced MyD88 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 mRNA expression in the liver, and an increase of tight junction proteins in the duodenum. Tropisetron treatment also caused a reduction of elevated serotonin levels and an increase of SERT in the duodenum of ob\/ob mice. Palonosetron had similar effects as tropisetron with regard to the reduction of liver fat and other parameters. Tropisetron and palonosetron are effective in attenuating NAFLD in a genetic mouse model of obesity. The effect involves the intestinal nervous system, resulting in a reduction of endotoxin influx into the liver and subsequently of liver inflammation and fat accumulation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007de2","doi":"10.1124\/jpet.111.181834","first_seen_on":"2011-09-10T18:11:51+00:00","issns":["1521-0103"],"journal":"The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1315668869,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21903748"],"pmid":"21903748","pubdate":"2011-09-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Serotonin-receptor-3-antagonists improve obesity-associated fatty liver disease in mice.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/serotonin-receptor-type-3-antagonists-improve-obesityassociated-fatty-liver-disease-mice-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4509149,"mean":5.2377591184699,"rank":1793457,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2643946,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4509149,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63539,"mean":4.96872979949,"rank":20505,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":41159,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63539,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1750,"mean":2.917520869068,"rank":979,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":761,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1750,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":3.9974444444444,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Professor":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"NL":1},"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/nmgds\/status\/112549511615881217","citation_ids":[257865],"posted_on":"2011-09-10T15:34:29+00:00","author":{"name":"nmgds","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1667523853\/linjen2_normal.png","description":"Throw a starfish back into the ocean.\r\nBiokjemi, mikrobiota, kosthold, livet.","id_on_source":"nmgds","tweeter_id":"91346968","followers":354},"tweet_id":"112549511615881217"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/chriskresser\/status\/112548822755966976","citation_ids":[257865],"posted_on":"2011-09-10T15:31:45+00:00","author":{"name":"Chris Kresser","url":"http:\/\/chriskresser.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/524902714220634112\/mGfqyCX4_normal.jpeg","description":"I'm a health detective specializing in investigative medicine, blogger, podcaster, teacher and a Paleo diet and lifestyle enthusiast.","id_on_source":"chriskresser","tweeter_id":"26129571","geo":{"lt":37.87159,"ln":-122.27275,"country":"US"},"followers":71196},"tweet_id":"112548822755966976"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/MoederEnKind\/status\/112549124154470401","citation_ids":[257865],"posted_on":"2011-09-10T15:32:56+00:00","author":{"name":"Nienke TodeGottenbos","url":"http:\/\/www.voormoederenkind.nl","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1644068005\/tw_13297400_1321560236_normal.jpg","description":"Centrum voor Moeder en Kind:  Jij en je kindje, Natuurlijk Gezond!\r\nEcht voedsel, Kruidengeneeskunde, Darmflora, Natural skincare, ook @Cute_Cotton\r\n","id_on_source":"moederenkind","tweeter_id":"292364965","geo":{"lt":52.171558,"ln":5.07966,"country":"NL"},"followers":397},"tweet_id":"112549124154470401"}]}}
