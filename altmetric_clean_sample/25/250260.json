Part of the catalytic proficiency of these dendritic enzyme models stems from multivalency effects observed in G2, G3 and G4 dendrimers displaying multiple catalytic groups in their branches. To study multivalency in higher generation systems, G4, G5 and G6 peptide dendrimers were prepared by a convergent assembly. Thus, peptide dendrimers bearing four or eight chloroacetyl groups at their N-termini underwent multiple thioether ligation with G2 and G3 peptide dendrimers with a cysteine residue at their focal point, to give G4, G5 and G6 dendrimers containing up to 341 amino acids, including multiple histidines or N-terminal prolines. While the efficiency of the esterase catalysts was comparable to that of their lower generation analogs, a remarkable reactivity increase was observed in G5 and G6 aldolase dendrimers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f6100083f3","authors":["Nicolas A.
