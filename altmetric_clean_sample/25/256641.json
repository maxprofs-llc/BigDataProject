Health system policies need to nurture a professional service ethic. The primary health care policy envisioned a national health system led by the public sector and based on a philosophy of cooperation. A common theme of 'health sector reform' in OECD countries, introduced in the context of neoliberalism, has been the use of 'managed competition' to increase efficiency. Some countries that flirted with health system competition have returned to cooperation. Market relationships tend to be oppositional and to stimulate self-seeking behaviour. Health system relationships should encourage patient and community centred behaviour. The World Bank and bilateral donors have exported health sector reform theories from the north to the south, involving privatization and marketization policies. This is despite the lack of evidence on their desirability or feasibility of implementing them. Private health care has increased in many developing countries, more as a result of economic crisis and liberalization than specific health sector reforms. Much of this private practice is unlicensed and unregulated, and informal privatization has had a damaging effect on health worker ethics. The lead policy should be reconstruction of the public health system, involving decentralization, democratization and improved management. Commonsense contracting of an existing private sector is different from a policy of proactive privatization and marketization. Underlying the two approaches is whether health care should be viewed as a human right best served by socialized provision or a private good requiring governments only to correct market failures and ensure basic care for the poor. It is a matter of politics, not economics.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61d3cf058f6100078ce","authors":["Malcolm Segall"],"doi":"10.1002\/(sici)1099-1751(200001\/03)15:1<61::aid-hpm573>3.0.co;2-4","first_seen_on":"2011-09-09T04:29:50+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0749-6753","1099-1751"],"issue":"1","journal":"The International Journal of Health Planning and Management","last_mentioned_on":1325558380,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10947568","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/(SICI)1099-1751(200001\/03)15:1<61::AID-HPM573>3.0.CO;2-4"],"pmid":"10947568","pubdate":"2000-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["healthservicesresearch","healthservices"],"title":"From cooperation to competition in national health systems--and back?: impact on professional ethics and quality of care.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/%28SICI%291099-1751%28200001\/03%2915%3A1%3C61%3A%3AAID-HPM573%3E3.0.CO%3B2-4","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cooperation-competition-national-health-systemsand-back-impact-professional-ethics-quality-care-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7004515,"mean":6.2582893528346,"rank":1258033,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":5718399,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7004515,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73802,"mean":5.5100651752686,"rank":14296,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":59042,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73802,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":183,"mean":3.0092087912088,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":160,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":183,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":4.275,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
