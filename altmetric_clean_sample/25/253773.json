In this work, we describe a novel approach to targeted antigen delivery by decorating the surface of polyanhydride nanoparticles with specific carbohydrates to provide \"pathogen-like\" properties that ensure nanoparticles engage C-type lectin receptors on DCs. The surface of polyanhydride nanoparticles was functionalized by covalent linkage of dimannose and lactose residues using an amine-carboxylic acid coupling reaction. Coculture of functionalized nanoparticles with bone marrow-derived DCs significantly increased cell surface expression of MHC II, the T cell costimulatory molecules CD86 and CD40, the C-type lectin receptor CIRE and the mannose receptor CD206 over the nonfunctionalized nanoparticles. Both nonfunctionalized and functionalized nanoparticles were efficiently internalized by DCs, indicating that internalization of functionalized nanoparticles was necessary but not sufficient to activate DCs. Blocking the mannose and CIRE receptors prior to the addition of functionalized nanoparticles to the culture inhibited the increased surface expression of MHC II, CD40 and CD86. Together, these data indicate that engagement of CIRE and the mannose receptor is a key mechanism by which functionalized nanoparticles activate DCs. These studies provide valuable insights into the rational design of targeted nanovaccine platforms to induce robust immune responses and improve vaccine efficacy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c9","doi":"10.1021\/mp200213r","first_seen_on":"2011-09-06T04:37:08+00:00","issns":["1543-8392"],"journal":"Molecular Pharmaceutics","last_mentioned_on":1315282908,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21882825?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21882825","pubdate":"2011-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","pharmacology"],"title":"Mannose-Functionalized \"Pathogen-Like\" Polyanhydride Nanoparticles Target C-Type Lectin Receptors on Dendritic Cells.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mannosefunctionalized-pathogenlike-polyanhydride-nanoparticles-target-ctype-lectin-receptors-dendrit"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":3108127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":982308,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63381,"mean":4.745425717892,"rank":40101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":14354,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63381,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":651,"mean":3.2825815384615,"rank":323,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":252,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":651,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":2.2125,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
