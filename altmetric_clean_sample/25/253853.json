Based on a large and non-clinical nationwide sample of children who were investigated as abuse victims and suspects of SIBs in Israel over a decade, the present study examines the rate of abuse history among child suspects who have admitted SIBs. In addition, this study compares some personal and family characteristics as well as selected aspects of SIBs reported by children with and without a history of abuse. Abuse history is then used to predict the nature of SIBs after controlling for other predictors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002502","doi":"10.1016\/j.chiabu.2010.09.002","first_seen_on":"2011-09-06T06:08:54+00:00","issns":["01452134"],"journal":"Child Abuse & Neglect","last_mentioned_on":1314925237,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S014521341100010X"],"pmid":"21316107","pubdate":"2011-02-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Von Aarburg, H.
