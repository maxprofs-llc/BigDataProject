Studies in a variety of model organisms show that miRNAs modulate developmental processes. To our knowledge, the only hereditary condition known to be caused by a miRNA is a form of adult-onset non-syndromic deafness, and no miRNA mutation has yet been found to be responsible for any developmental defect in humans. Here we report the identification of germline hemizygous deletions of MIR17HG, encoding the miR-17\u223c92 polycistronic miRNA cluster, in individuals with microcephaly, short stature and digital abnormalities. We demonstrate that haploinsufficiency of miR-17\u223c92 is responsible for these developmental abnormalities by showing that mice harboring targeted deletion of the miR-17\u223c92 cluster phenocopy several key features of the affected humans. These findings identify a regulatory function for miR-17\u223c92 in growth and skeletal development and represent the first example of an miRNA gene responsible for a syndromic developmental defect in humans.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003164","authors":["Lo\u00c3\u00afc de Pontual","Evelyn Yao","Patrick Callier","Laurence Faivre","Val\u00c3\u00a9rie Drouin","Sandra Cariou","Arie Van Haeringen","David Genevi\u00c3\u00a8ve","Alice Goldenberg","Myriam Oufadem","Sylvie Manouvrier","Arnold Munnich","Joana Alves Vidigal","Michel Vekemans","Stanislas Lyonnet","Alexandra Henrion-Caude","Andrea Ventura","Jeanne Amiel","de Pontual L","Yao E","Callier P","Faivre L","Drouin V","Cariou S","Van Haeringen A","Genevi\u00e8ve D","Goldenberg A","Oufadem M","Manouvrier S","Munnich A","Vidigal JA","Vekemans M","Lyonnet S","Henrion-Caude A","Ventura A","Amiel J"],"doi":"10.1038\/ng.915","endpage":"1030","first_seen_on":"2011-09-04T21:55:28+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1061-4036","1546-1718"],"issue":"10","journal":"Nature Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1323388800,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ng\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/ng.915.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/ng.915","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ng\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/abs\/ng.915.html?WT.mc_id=TWT_NatureGen","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21892160?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/ng\/rss\/current\/~3\/IoWRCuxKBFY\/ng.915","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21892160","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3184212"],"pmcid":"PMC3184212","pmid":"21892160","pubdate":"2011-09-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1026","subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Germline deletion of the miR-17-92 cluster causes growth and skeletal defects in humans","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/germline-deletion-mir1792-cluster-causes-skeletal-growth-defects-humans"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7018107,"mean":6.2627935092433,"rank":1031534,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":5983179,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7018107,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73665,"mean":5.5136461772372,"rank":11867,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":61714,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73665,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4248,"mean":22.487294560866,"rank":1732,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":2508,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4248,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73,"mean":11.330861111111,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":40,"Student  > Ph.
