We have developed new methods of synthesizing insulated \u03c0-conjugated molecules involving the self-inclusion of rotaxane precursors linking \u03c0-conjugated units as a guest and permethylated cyclodextrin (PMCD) as a macrocyclic host. The insulated \u03c0-conjugated molecules thus formed are highly soluble in organic solvents and display photoluminescence efficiency. This paper also highlights a new method for synthesizing insulated molecular wire (IMW) through the polymerization of insulated \u03c0-conjugated molecules as monomers. The IMWs thus formed have a high covering ratio, rigidity, and showed high charge mobility in the solid state; further, they are readily soluble in a variety of organic solvents. In this account, the synthetic methodologies and characteristic of insulated \u03c0-conjugated molecules and IMWs are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e4a","authors":["Terao, Jun"],"doi":"10.1002\/tcr.201100009","endpage":"283","first_seen_on":"2011-09-07T12:18:13+00:00","issns":["1528-0691","1527-8999"],"issue":"5","journal":"The Chemical Record","last_mentioned_on":1315396626,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/tcr.201100009"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/tcr.201100009\/pdf","pmid":"21898775","pubdate":"2011-09-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u00e2\u0080\u0090VCH Verlag","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Materials Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Medicine","Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"269","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"\u00cf\u0080\u00e2\u0080\u0090conjugated molecules covered by permethylated cyclodextrins","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/%CF%80conjugated-molecules-covered-permethylated-cyclodextrins"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6378189,"mean":5.9866683057946,"rank":3007792,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1907537,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6378189,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67988,"mean":5.5533668495447,"rank":32563,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":21926,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67988,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":130,"mean":2.7153798449612,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":130,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
