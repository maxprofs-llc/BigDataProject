The goal of this work was the developing of an analytical method based on dynamic headspace GC-MS to determine the concentration of 24 fragrances in saliva or sweat simulant. Under optimized conditions, 5 mL of the migration simulant with 2 g sodium chloride were incubated for 10 min at 30\u00b0C. The headspace was purged at a flow rate of 50 mL\/min. The compounds were quantified by internal calibration resulting in good linearity (>0.991). The recovery was greater than 66.3% for most of the compounds. The limits of detection ranged between 0.5 ng\/mL for hydrophobic and 196.0 ng\/mL for hydrophilic fragrances. The method was subsequently applied to seven real toys purchased from the market. The highest migration rate could be observed for benzyl benzoate with 268.0 ng\/cm(2)\/min. Based on the migration data measured, the ranges of dermal and oral exposure of children to fragrances in scented toys were calculated. The maximum oral and dermal exposure levels were estimated at 22.2 \u03bcg per kg body weight (BW) and day (d) for benzyl benzoate and 605.0 \u03bcg\/kg BW\/d for benzyl alcohol, respectively.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e43","doi":"10.1002\/jssc.201100360","first_seen_on":"2011-09-08T20:53:03+00:00","issns":["1615-9314"],"journal":"Journal of Separation Science (JSS) (formerly Journal of High Resolution Chromatography)","last_mentioned_on":1315514780,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21898805"],"pmid":"21898805","pubdate":"2011-08-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Estimation of dermal and oral exposure of children to scented toys: Analysis of the migration of fragrance allergens by dynamic headspace GC-MS.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/estimation-dermal-oral-exposure-children-scented-toys-analysis-migration-fragrance-allergens-dynamic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":3557196,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":831005,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65093,"mean":5.2213720580102,"rank":44407,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":9313,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65093,"percentile":14},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1134,"mean":0.99619770520741,"rank":427,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":72,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1134,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":0.69117647058824,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
