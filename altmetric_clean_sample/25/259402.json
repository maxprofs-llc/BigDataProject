These achievements are primarily attributed to the public health services and patriotic public health campaigns, although the contribution of high-technology medical applications is also recognized. However, along with the recent socio-economic developments and scientific and technological progress, medical disciplines have become more and more specialized, and clinical and preventive medicine have become further separated from each other. Conventional Chinese wisdom says 'when long divided they must unite, when long united they must divide'. At the onset of the new round of reforms of health care in China, it seems important to revisit the discussions on the urgency for integration of health sciences in medicine in China. Several issues and viewpoints on integrating medicine are discussed in this paper. The biopsychosocial model for health calls for broad integration. Primary care development in China requires integration in education and practice, and in treatment and prevention. Control of chronic diseases requires integrated and united action. Integration of traditional Chinese medicine with Western medicine requires creativity. The integration perspective should be instilled in the minds of medical students. Integration also entails integrated practice. After all, integration entails integrated education and practice in public health education. Changing the current public health education system still has a long way to go. True integration requires integration of concepts, policies, resources and measures, as well as changes in the organization of health care including public health, prevention and treatment. This needs to be a systematic process. Finally, success of integration relies on social mobilization, advocacy, promotion and attention of the entire society.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033f2","doi":"10.1016\/j.puhe.2010.10.008","first_seen_on":"2011-09-13T00:46:29+00:00","issns":["1476-5616"],"issue":"1","journal":"Public Health (Elsevier)","last_mentioned_on":1315872307,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21168177?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21168177","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"The need for integration in health sciences sets the future direction for public health education.","type":"article","volume":"125","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/need-integration-health-sciences-sets-future-direction-public-health-education-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630293,"mean":4.9302727339889,"rank":2899689,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":79331,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630293,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60862,"mean":4.290650958742,"rank":41155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":418,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60862,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":404,"mean":3.3895930521092,"rank":330,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":404,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":2.00625,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
