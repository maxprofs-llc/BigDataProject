Human dentin beams were treated with phosphoric acid, with Clearfil SE Bond Primer or with Clearfil SE Bond Primer plus ZnCl(2) (2 wt%). Acid-etched dentin was infiltrated with Single Bond, Single Bond plus ZnCl(2) (2 wt%), or Single Bond plus ZnO nanoparticles (10 wt%), and Clearfil SE Bond-primed dentin was infiltrated with Clearfil SE Bonding resin, Clearfil SE-Bonding resin with ZnCl(2) (2 wt%), or Clearfil SE-Bonding resin with ZnO nanoparticles (10 wt%). The C-terminal telopeptide concentrations were determined 24 h, and 1 and 4 wk after treatment. Microtensile bond strength to dentin was determined for the tested adhesives. Matrix metalloproteinases-mediated collagen degradation occurred in acid-etched and SE-primed dentin. Resin infiltration decreased collagen degradation. Lower collagen degradation was found for SE Bond than for Single Bond. Zinc-doped Single Bond resin always reduced collagen degradation, the ZnO particles being more effective than ZnCl(2) . Zinc-doped SE Bond reduced the liberation of C-terminal telopeptide only at 24 h. Bond strength to dentin was not decreased when Zn-doped resins were employed, except when ZnCl(2) was added to SE Primer. Zinc-doped resin reduced collagen degradation in Single Bond hybrid layers, but did not affect bond strength. The addition of zinc to SE Bond had no beneficial effects.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002846","authors":["Osorio, Raquel","Yamauti, Monica","Osorio, Estrella","Rom\u00e1n, Julio S.","Toledano, Manuel"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1600-0722.2011.00853.x","endpage":"410","first_seen_on":"2011-09-07T14:47:50+00:00","issns":["1600-0722","0909-8836"],"issue":"5","journal":"European Journal of Oral Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1315403401,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1600-0722.2011.00853.x\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1600-0722.2011.00853.x\/pdf","pmid":"21896058","pubdate":"2011-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"401","subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Zinc\u00e2\u0080\u0090doped dentin adhesive for collagen protection at the hybrid layer","type":"article","volume":"119","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/zincdoped-dentin-adhesive-collagen-protection-hybrid-layer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506935,"mean":5.125739366827,"rank":2319044,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1558714,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506935,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63225,"mean":4.8300239782361,"rank":28084,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":24661,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63225,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":199,"mean":2.3229797979798,"rank":88,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":78,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":199,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.375,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
