The Asia Oceania Human Proteome Organisation (AOHUPO) has therefore embarked on a Membrane Proteomics Initiative (MPI) using a large range of workflows. Here, we describe the characterization of the MPI mouse liver microsomal membrane Standard using SDS-PAGE prior to in-gel tryptic digestion and LC-ESI-MS\/MS. The Na(2) CO(3) wash followed by SDS-PAGE prior to in-gel tryptic digestion and LC-MS\/MS strategy was effective for the detection of membrane proteins with 47.1% of the identified proteins being transmembrane proteins. Gene Ontology term enrichment analysis showed that biological processes involving transport, lipid metabolism, cell communication, cell adhesion, and cellular component organization were significantly enriched. Comparison of the present data with the previously published reports on mouse liver proteomes confirmed that the MPI Standard provides an excellent resource for the analysis of membrane proteins in the AOHUPO MPI.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f610008649","authors":["Peng, Lifeng","Kapp, Eugene A.","McLauchlan, Danyl","Jordan, T.
