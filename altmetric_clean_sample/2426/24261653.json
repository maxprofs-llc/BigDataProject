This shaped the global response led by WHO in the first global emergency since Ebola in West Africa.\nThe response to Zika highlights important issues and lessons for future outbreaks that might pose an international risk. Particular challenges arose in trying to maintain an evidence-based approach to public risk communication when the evidence is unclear or still evolving. The Zika incident also demonstrates the importance of public health practitioners and agencies understanding the political context in which outbreaks must be managed and understanding the competing factors that shape the political response.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033f2","authors":["McCloskey, B.","Endericks, T.","B.
