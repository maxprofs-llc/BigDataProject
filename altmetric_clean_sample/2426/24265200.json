We assume that the strength of support afferents is related to the magnitude of the ground reaction forces (GRF). For this purpose it was necessary to compare the GRF magnitude on the Russian BD-2 treadmill for different locomotion types (walking and running), modes (active and passive), and subjects.\nRelative GRF values were analyzed while subjects performed walking and running during active and passive modes of treadmill belt movement under 1 G (N = 6) and 0 G (N = 4) conditions.\nFor different BD-2 modes and both types of locomotion, maximum GRF values varied in both 0 G and 1 G. Considerable individual variations were also found in the locomotion strategies, as well as in maximum GRF values. In 0 G, the smallest GRF values were observed for walking in active mode, and the largest during running in passive mode. In 1 G, GRF values were higher during running than while walking, but the difference between active and passive modes was not observed; we assume this was due to the uniqueness of the GRF profile.\nThe maximum GRF recorded during walking and running in active and passive modes depended on the individual pattern of locomotion. The maximum GRF values that we recorded on BD-2 were close to values found by other researchers. The observations from this study could guide individualized countermeasures prescriptions for microgravity.Fomina E, Savinkina A.
