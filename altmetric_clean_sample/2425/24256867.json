We recently generated a Plasmodium berghei (PbNK65) parasite that lacks a secreted factor, the histamine releasing factor (HRF) (PbNK65 hrf\u0394), and induces in infected mice a self-resolving blood stage infection accompanied by a long lasting immunity. Here, we explore the immunological mechanisms underlying the anti-parasite protective properties of the mutant PbNK65 hrf\u0394 and demonstrate that in addition to an up-regulation of IL-6 production, CD4(+) but not CD8(+) T effector lymphocytes are indispensable for the clearance of malaria infection. Maintenance of T cell-associated protection is associated with the reduction in CD4(+)PD-1(+) and CD8(+)PD-1(+) T cell numbers. A higher number of central and effector memory B cells in mutant-infected mice also plays a pivotal role in protection. Importantly, we also demonstrate that prior infection with WT parasites followed by a drug cure does not prevent the induction of PbNK65 hrf\u0394-induced protection, suggesting that such protection in humans may be efficient even in individuals that have been infected and who repeatedly received antimalarial drugs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Claudia Demarta-Gatsi","Roger Peronet","Leanna Smith","Sabine Thiberge","Robert M\u00e9nard","Salaheddine M\u00e9cheri"],"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-017-09684-2","first_seen_on":"2017-08-24T10:04:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2045-2322"],"issue":"1","journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1503569053,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28831137?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28831137","pubdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["science"],"title":"Immunological memory to blood-stage malaria infection is controlled by the histamine releasing factor (HRF) of the parasite","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/immunological-memory-bloodstage-malaria-infection-controlled-histamine-releasing-factor-hrf-parasite"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8422812,"mean":7.0866213065837,"rank":7278478,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8422812,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171136,"mean":12.754963566775,"rank":140304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171136,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37619,"mean":14.728024190547,"rank":31250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37619,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3719,"mean":13.51596718666,"rank":2943,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3719,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MalariaPapers\/statuses\/900660007791939584","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24256867],"posted_on":"2017-08-24T10:04:13+00:00","author":{"name":"Malaria Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/633328476070785024\/zGKHLt0g_normal.png","description":"I'm a bot tweeting papers about malaria as they appear on PubMed (& now preprints on BioRxiv). \n\nRun by @theosanderson.","id_on_source":"MalariaPapers","tweeter_id":"3428446343","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":144},"tweet_id":"900660007791939584"}]}}
