Currently, there is a lack of in\u00a0vivo screening technologies for the discovery of compounds that affect the age-dependent neuronal physiology. Here, we present a high-throughput, microfluidic-based assay for automated manipulation and on-chip monitoring and analysis of stimulus-evoked calcium responses of intact C. elegans at various life stages. First, we successfully applied our technology to quantify the effects of aging and age-related genetic and chemical factors in the calcium transients of the ASH sensory neuron. We then performed a large-scale screen of a library of 107 FDA-approved compounds to identify hits that prevented the age-dependent functional deterioration of ASH. The robust performance of our assay makes it a valuable tool for future high-throughput applications based on in vivo functional imaging.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Daphne Bazopoulou","Amrita R.
