Although there is much evidence for this in class-based environments, there is a lack of research on Computer-Based Learning Environments (CBLEs). Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate student behavior in a blended learning program and specifically procrastination behavior in relation to performance through Data Mining techniques. Materials and Methods: A sample of 140 undergraduate students participated in a blended learning experience implemented in a Moodle (Modular Object Oriented Developmental Learning Environment) Management System. Relevant interaction variables were selected for the study, taking into account student achievement and analyzing data by means of association rules, a mining technique. The association rules were arrived at and filtered through two selection criteria: 1, rules must have an accuracy over 0.8 and 2, they must be present in both sub-samples. Results: The findings of our study highlight the influence of time management in online learning environments, particularly on academic achievement, as there is an association between procrastination variables and student performance. Conclusion: Negative impact of procrastination in learning outcomes has been observed again but in virtual learning environments where practical implications, prevention of, and intervention in, are different from class-based learning. These aspects are discussed to help resolve student difficulties at various ages.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc1b","authors":["Cerezo, Rebeca","Esteban, Mar\u00eda","S\u00e1nchez-Santill\u00e1n, Miguel","N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Jos\u00e9 C."],"doi":"10.3389\/fpsyg.2017.01403","first_seen_on":"2017-08-24T07:32:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1664-1078"],"journal":"Frontiers in Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1503647148,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpsyg.2017.01403\/full?utm_source=S-TWT&utm_medium=SNET&utm_campaign=ECO_FPSYG_XXXXXXXX_auto-dlvrit","http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpsyg.2017.01403\/full"],"pmcid":"PMC5573842","pmid":"28883801","pubdate":"2017-08-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Procrastinating Behavior in Computer-Based Learning Environments to Predict Performance: A Case Study in Moodle","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/procrastinating-behavior-computerbased-learning-environments-predict-performance-case-study-moodle"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.35,"score_history":{"1y":4.35,"6m":4.35,"3m":4.35,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8425604,"mean":7.0878923279354,"rank":1800235,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6613777,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8425604,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172367,"mean":12.777354106958,"rank":45545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":126454,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172367,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7955,"mean":11.069986924818,"rank":2650,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":5275,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7955,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267,"mean":4.5718421052632,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
