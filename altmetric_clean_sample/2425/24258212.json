Understanding of the underlying pathways of this heterogeneous disease needed for the development of targeted treatments. Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) is a statistical technique to identify gene profiles in heterogeneous samples.\nTo identify gene profiles associated with adult-onset severe asthma.\nThis was a cross-sectional, observational study in which adult patients with adult-onset of asthma (defined as starting at \u226518yrs old) as compared to childhood-onset severe asthma (<18 yrs) were selected from the U-BIOPRED cohort. Gene expression was assessed on the total RNA of induced sputum (n=83), nasal brushings (n=41), and endobronchial brushings (n=65) and biopsies (n=47) (Affymetrix HT HG-U133+ PM). GSVA was used to identify differentially enriched pre-defined gene signatures of leukocyte lineage, inflammatory and induced lung injury pathways.\nSignificant differentially enriched gene signatures in patients with adult-onset as compared to childhood-onset severe asthma were identified in nasal brushings (5 signatures), sputum (3 signatures) and endobronchial brushings (6 signatures). Signatures associated with eosinophilic airway inflammation, mast cells and group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) were more enriched in adult-onset severe asthma, whereas signatures associated with induced lung injury were less enriched in adult-onset severe asthma.\nAdult-onset severe asthma is characterized by inflammatory pathways involving eosinophils, mast cells and ILC3s. These pathways could represent useful targets for the treatment of adult-onset severe asthma.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b59","authors":["Pieter-Paul Hekking","Matt J.
