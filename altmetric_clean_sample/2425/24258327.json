Compounds that target the orthosteric site of CB1 in some cases have shown side effects. Allosteric modulators could potentially avoid these side effects by influencing binding and\/or efficacy of orthosteric ligands. Here, we summarize and compare previous data on different putative allosteric binding sites observed in CB1 homology models with an in silico docking study of the recently published crystal structure of the same receptor on endogenous and natural hydrophobic ligands that act as positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) and negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) of CB1 . In particular, a lipid-exposed pocket targeted by most of the tested molecules is reported and discussed. This article is protected by copyright.
