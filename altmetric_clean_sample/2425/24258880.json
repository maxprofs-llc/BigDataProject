Here, we have used Drosophila melanogaster to explore the contribution of individual or clusters of miRNAs in countering systemic C. albicans infection. From a total of 72 tested, we identify six miRNAs allelic mutant backgrounds that modulate the survival response to infection and ability to control pathogen number. These mutants also exhibit dysregulation of the Toll pathway target transcripts Drosomycin (Drs) and Immune-Induced Molecule 1 (IM1). These are characteristics of defects in Toll signalling, and consistent with this, we demonstrate dependency for one of the miRNA mutants on the NF-\u03ba\u0392 homologue Dif. We also quantify changes in the miRNA expression profile over time in response to three pathogen types, and identify 13 mature miRNA forms affected by pathogens that stimulate Toll signalling. To complement this, we provide a genome-wide map of potential NF-\u03ba\u0392 sites in proximity to miRNA genes. Finally, we demonstrate that systemic C. albicans infection contributes to a reduction in the total amount of Branch-Chained Amino Acids, which is miRNA-regulated. Overall, our data reveal a new layer of miRNA complexity regulating the fly response to systemic fungal infection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002942","authors":["Magda L.
