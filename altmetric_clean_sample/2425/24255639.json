It is based on a semi-liquid cathode composed of a Li2S8 polysulphide catholyte and a binder-free carbon nanofiber membrane with tailored morphology. The polysulphides in the catholyte have the dual role of active material and providing Li(+)-conduction, i.e. no traditional Li-salt is used in this cell. The cell is able to deliver an areal capacity as high as 7\u2009mAh cm(-2), twice than that of commercial Lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) and 2-4 times higher than that of state-of-the-art LiS cells. In addition, the battery concept has an improved sustainability from a material point of view by being mainly based on sulfur and carbon and being completely fluorine-free, no fluorinated salt or binders are used, and has potential for upscaling and competitive price. The combination of these properties makes the semi-liquid LiS cell here reported a very promising new concept for practical large-scale energy storage applications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Lim, Du Hyun","Agostini, Marco","Nitze, Florian","Manuel, James","Ahn, Jou-Hyeon","Matic, Aleksandar","Du Hyun Lim, Marco Agostini, Florian Nitze, James Manuel, Jou-Hyeon Ahn, Aleksandar Matic"],"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-017-06593-2","first_seen_on":"2017-08-24T09:23:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"issue":"1","journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1503566561,"links":["http:\/\/publications.lib.chalmers.se\/publication\/251384-route-to-sustainable-lithium-sulfur-batteries-with-high-practical-capacity-through-a-fluorine-free-p"],"pmcid":"PMC5524792","pmid":"28740246","pubdate":"2017-08-24T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["science"],"title":"Route to sustainable lithium-sulfur batteries with high practical capacity through a fluorine free polysulfide catholyte and self-standing Carbon Nanofiber membranes","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/route-sustainable-lithiumsulfur-batteries-high-practical-capacity-through-fluorine-free-polysulfide"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8422812,"mean":7.0866213065837,"rank":7278477,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8422812,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171135,"mean":12.755032255425,"rank":140304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171135,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37619,"mean":14.728024190547,"rank":31250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37619,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3718,"mean":13.519536185096,"rank":2943,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3718,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
