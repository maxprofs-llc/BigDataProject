The percentage and absolute number of OKT3-reactive lymphocytes was comparable in healthy elderly individuals (65-84 years old) and young individuals (19-31 years old). The number of OKT4-reactive T lymphocytes from peripheral blood was significantly greater in the older group while the number of OKT8-reactive T lymphocytes was significantly lower. The OKT4\/OKT8 ratio was significantly greater in old compared to young subjects. The change in the OKT4\/OKT8 ratio did not correlate, in either young or old, with the proliferative response of lymphocytes induced by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or concanavalin A (Con A). Although lymphocytes that form rosettes with autologous erythrocytes, a marker of early T lymphocyte lineage, are increased in old subjects, other markers of early T lineage were found to be absent (OKT6), showed no difference (OKT10), or were comparable in young and old subjects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9153cf058f61000ce9d","authors":["Schwab, R","Staiano-Coico, L","Weksler, M E"],"first_seen_on":"2016-05-18T15:49:48+00:00","issns":["0735-3111"],"issue":"3","journal":"Diagnostic immunology","last_mentioned_on":1463586576,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/6333957"],"pmid":"6333957","pubdate":"1983-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Immunological studies of aging.
