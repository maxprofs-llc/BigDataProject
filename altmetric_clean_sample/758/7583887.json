These systems can improve the quality of nursing records, enable care continuity, consistency in written communication, and enhance safety for patients and providers alike.\nCross-sectional study.\nA total of 138 records from two facilities (69 records from each facility) were analyzed, one using the NANDA-International and Nursing Interventions Classification terminology (Center 1) and one the International Classification for Nursing Practice (Center 2), by means of the Quality of Diagnoses, Interventions, and Outcomes (Q-DIO) instrument. Q-DIO scores range from zero to 58 points. Nursing records were dated 2012-2013 for Center 1 and 2010-2011 for Center 2.\nCenter 1 had a Q-DIO score of 35.46 (\u00b16.45), whereas Center 2 had a Q-DIO score of 31.72 (\u00b14.62) (p<0.001). Center 2 had higher scores in the 'Nursing Diagnoses as Process' dimension, whereas in the 'Nursing Diagnoses as Product', 'Nursing Interventions', and 'Nursing Outcomes' dimensions, Center 1 exhibited superior performance; acceptable reliability values were obtained for both centers, except for the 'Nursing Interventions' domain in Center 1 and the 'Nursing Diagnoses as Process' and 'Nursing Diagnoses as Product' domains in Center 2.\nThe quality of nursing documentation was superior at Center 1, although both facilities demonstrated moderate scores considering the maximum potential score of 58 points. Reliability analyses showed satisfactory results for both standardized terminologies. This article is protected by copyright.
