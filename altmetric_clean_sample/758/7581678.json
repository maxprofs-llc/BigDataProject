However, the contribution of distorted parental transmission of alleles to risk of type 2 diabetes has been mostly unexplored. Our goal was therefore to search for parent-of-origin effects (POE) among type 2 diabetes loci in families.\nFamilies from the Botnia study (n\u2009=\u20094,211, 1,083 families) were genotyped for 72 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with type 2 diabetes and assessed for POE on type 2 diabetes. The family-based Hungarian Transdanubian Biobank (HTB) (n\u2009=\u20091,463, >135 families) was used to replicate SNPs showing POE. Association of type 2 diabetes loci within families was also tested.\nThree loci showed nominal POE, including the previously reported variants in KCNQ1, for type 2 diabetes in families from Botnia (rs2237895: p POE \u2009=\u20090.037), which can be considered positive controls. The strongest POE was seen for rs7578597 SNP in the THADA gene, showing excess transmission of the maternal risk allele T to diabetic offspring (Botnia: p POE \u2009=\u20090.01; HTB p POE \u2009=\u20090.045). These data are consistent with previous evidence of allelic imbalance for expression in islets, suggesting that the THADA gene can be imprinted in a POE-specific fashion. Five CpG sites, including those flanking rs7578597, showed differential methylation between diabetic and non-diabetic donor islets.\nTaken together, the data emphasise the need for genetic studies to consider from which parent an offspring has inherited a susceptibility allele.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007106","authors":["Rashmi B.
