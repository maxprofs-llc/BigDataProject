We tested effect of two phospholipids, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) and 1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DHPC) on amyloid aggregation of hen egg white (HEW) lysozyme in vitro.\nEffect of phospholipids was investigated using spectroscopic techniques (fluorescence and CD spectroscopy), atomic force microscopy and image analysis.\nPhospholipids DMPC and DHPC are able dose-dependently inhibit lysozyme fibril formation. The length of the phospholipid tails and different structural arrangement of the phospholipid molecules affect inhibitory activity; long-chain DMPC inhibits fibrillization more efficiently. Interestingly, interference of DMPC with lysozyme amyloid fibrils has no effect on their morphology or amount.\nPhospholipid molecules have significant effect on lysozyme amyloid fibrillization. We suggest that inhibitory activity is due to the interference of phospholipids with lysozyme leading to the blocking of the intermolecular protein interactions important for formation of the cross-\u03b2 structure within the core of the fibrils. The higher inhibitory activity of DMPC is probably due to adsorption of protein molecules on the liposome surfaces which caused decrease of species needed for fibrillization. Interaction of the phospholipids with formed fibrils is not sufficient enough to interrupt the bonds in \u03b2-sheets which are required for destroying of amyloid fibrils.\nThe obtained results contribute to a better understanding of the effect of phospholipids on amyloid fibrillization of the lysozyme. The data suggest that DMPC and DHPC phospholipids represent agents able to modulate lysozyme amyloid aggregation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002391","authors":["Slavomira Ponikova","Jana Kubackova","Zuzana Bednarikova","Jozef Marek","Erna Demjen","Andrea Antosova","Andrej Musatov","Zuzana Gazova"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbagen.2017.08.023","first_seen_on":"2017-09-04T06:34:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["03044165","0006-3002"],"journal":"BBA - General Subjects","last_mentioned_on":1504520346,"links":["https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.bbagen.2017.08.023","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28865760?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28865760","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Inhibition of lysozyme amyloidogenesis by phospholipids.
