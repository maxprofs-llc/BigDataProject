Theranostics has been used in clinical routines in nuclear medicine for more than 60 y-as (131)I for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in thyroid diseases. In this minireview, we provide a survey of the use of 2 different radioiodine isotopes for targeting the sodium-iodine symporter in thyroid cancer and nonthyroidal neoplasms as well as a brief summary of theranostics for neuroendocrine neoplasms and metastatic castration-refractory prostate cancer. In particular, we discuss the role of (124)I-based dosimetry in targeting of the sodium-iodine symporter and describe the clinical application of (124)I dosimetry in a patient who had radioiodine-refractory thyroid cancer and who underwent a redifferentiation treatment with the mitogen-activated extracellular signal-related kinase kinase inhibitor trametinib.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007da6","authors":["James Nagarajah","Marcel Janssen","Philipp Hetkamp","Walter Jentzen"],"doi":"10.2967\/jnumed.116.186866","first_seen_on":"2017-09-04T06:33:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0161-5505","2159-662X","1535-5667"],"issue":"Suppl 2","journal":"Journal of Nuclear Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1506420342,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28864610?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28864610","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"Iodine Symporter Targeting with 124 I\/ 131 I Theranostics","type":"article","volume":"58","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/iodine-symporter-targeting-sup124sup-i-sup131sup-i-theranostics"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0.5,"1w":0.25,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462170,"mean":7.1084920520889,"rank":6420610,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1150778,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462170,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169812,"mean":12.146663985254,"rank":119729,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":31468,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169812,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2276,"mean":4.4520914285714,"rank":1408,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":603,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2276,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82,"mean":4.2691358024691,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
