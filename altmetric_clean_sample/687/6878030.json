CRE related-infections have significant morbidity and mortality, but data on CRE infection in pediatric population are limited. The aim of this study was to analyze epidemiologic and clinical characteristics, risk factors, therapeutic options and outcome of CRE infections in children in Italy.\nWe performed a retrospective, multicenter, observational study of children with confirmed CRE infection or colonization admitted between 1 January 2011 and 1 March 2014 to 7 Italian pediatric centers.\nSixty-nine patients presenting 74 CRE infections and\/or colonization were included. The most frequently isolated strain was Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae. Children with CRE infections had longer length of stay in hospital (P <0.001), duration of disease (P =0.001) and antimicrobial treatment (P <0.001) than colonized children. Oncologic\/immunosuppressive conditions are one of the factors significantly associated with a fatal outcome among children with CRE infections.\nOur study confirms that CRE infections affect mostly children with oncologic diseases and immunosuppression. Controlled studies in large cohorts are needed to evaluate the best therapeutic options and to assess further risk factors influencing outcomes and the survival of pediatric patients with infections caused by CRE.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008487","authors":["Montagnani, Carlotta","Prato, Manuela","Scolfaro, Carlo","Colombo, Sara","Esposito, Susanna","Tagliabue, Claudia","Lo Vecchio, Andrea","Bruzzese, Eugenia","Loy, Anna","Cursi, Laura","Vuerich, Marco","de Martino, Maurizio","Galli, Luisa",", ","for the Italian Society of Pediatric Infectious Diseases"],"doi":"10.1097\/inf.0000000000001188","first_seen_on":"2016-04-22T11:00:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-0987","0891-3668"],"issue":"8","journal":"The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal","last_mentioned_on":1469123217,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27100130?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/pidj\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Carbapenem_Resistant_Enterobacteriaceae_Infections.97392.aspx","http:\/\/mobile.journals.lww.com\/pidj\/_layouts\/15\/oaks.journals.mobile\/articleviewer.aspx?year=2016&issue=08000&article=00007"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/pidj\/2016\/08000\/Carbapenem_resistant_Enterobacteriaceae_Infections.7.pdf","pmid":"27100130","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["communicablediseases","pediatrics"],"title":"Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae Infections in Children","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/pidj\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Carbapenem_Resistant_Enterobacteriaceae_Infections.97392.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/carbapenemresistant-enterobacteriaceae-infections-children"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8088508,"mean":6.8823654995833,"rank":1959209,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6090991,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8088508,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270748,"mean":11.471355361278,"rank":83779,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":185633,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270748,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3420,"mean":3.5351962562153,"rank":663,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":2724,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3420,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106,"mean":5.7561904761905,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":77,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":1,"GB":2,"ES":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/KlebsPapers\/statuses\/723466438556549120","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6878030],"posted_on":"2016-04-22T11:00:14+00:00","author":{"name":"Klebsiella Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/626237508884377600\/wthBZBQF_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"KlebsPapers","tweeter_id":"3300043128","geo":{"lt":-37.83333,"ln":144.96667,"country":"AU"},"followers":158},"tweet_id":"723466438556549120"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ndm1bacteria\/statuses\/724495564600016897","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6878030],"posted_on":"2016-04-25T07:09:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Dave Roberts","url":"http:\/\/www.ndm1bacteria.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1294321879\/713px-EscherichiaColi_NIAID_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"ndm1bacteria","tweeter_id":"177368473","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":549},"tweet_id":"724495564600016897"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AntibioticLeeds\/statuses\/724834958162931712","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6878030],"posted_on":"2016-04-26T05:38:15+00:00","author":{"name":"Philip Howard","url":"http:\/\/nww.lhp.leedsth.nhs.uk\/antimicrobials","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/666506311757000704\/sqRxYL8O_normal.png","description":"Consultant Antimicrobial Pharmacist in Leeds.
