However, the incidence of ILD was reported as high as 8.5\u00a0% in a Japanese phase II study. These results suggest the influence of ethnic factors in the association of the use of gemcitabine plus erlotinib with the incidence of ILD. Here, we conducted a prospective study to analyze the relationship between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and ILD in Japanese patients with advanced pancreatic cancer receiving gemcitabine plus erlotinib.\nPatients were treated with gemcitabine (1000\u00a0mg\/m(2); administered by intravenous infusion on days 1, 8, and 15 every 4\u00a0weeks) and erlotinib (given orally at 100\u00a0mg\/day). We compared the frequencies of HLA alleles in patients who did and did not develop ILD.\nA total of 57 patients were treated, and 4 patients (7.0\u00a0%) developed ILD. The combination of HLA-B*15:01 and DRB1*15:01 was observed in 2 of 4 patients (50\u00a0%) with ILD and in only 1 of 53 patients without ILD (2\u00a0%) resulting in odds ratio of 52.0 (95\u00a0% CI 3.2-842.5; p\u00a0=\u00a00.011).\nThese results suggest that the combination of HLA-B*15:01 and DRB1*15:01 is associated with ILD in Japanese patients with advanced pancreatic cancer receiving gemcitabine plus erlotinib.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002497","authors":["Meiko Nishimura","Masanori Toyoda","Kei Takenaka","Yoshinori Imamura","Naoko Chayahara","Naomi Kiyota","Toru Mukohara","Takeshi Kotake","Akihito Tsuji","Kosuke Saito","Yoshiro Saito","Hironobu Minami","Nishimura, Meiko","Toyoda, Masanori","Takenaka, Kei","Imamura, Yoshinori","Chayahara, Naoko","Kiyota, Naomi","Mukohara, Toru","Kotake, Takeshi","Tsuji, Akihito","Saito, Kosuke","Saito, Yoshiro","Minami, Hironobu"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00280-016-3026-6","first_seen_on":"2016-04-22T05:39:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-0843","0344-5704"],"journal":"Cancer Chemotherapy & Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1461323591,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00280-016-3026-6","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27100735?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00280-016-3026-6.pdf","pmid":"27100735","pubdate":"2016-04-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms","antineoplasticagents"],"title":"The combination of HLA-B*15:01 and DRB1*15:01 is associated with gemcitabine plus erlotinib-induced interstitial lung disease in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/combination-hlab1501-drb11501-associated-gemcitabine-plus-erlotinibinduced-interstitial-lung-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7588328,"mean":6.5418890751503,"rank":6569781,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7588328,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266862,"mean":11.331218034857,"rank":223768,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266862,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":595,"mean":2.4265555555556,"rank":452,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":595,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.5795454545455,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Unspecified":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/723469694804467712","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6870716],"posted_on":"2016-04-22T11:13:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":713},"tweet_id":"723469694804467712"}]}}
