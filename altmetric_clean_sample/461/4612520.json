This study has a retrospective design. HCWs who presented between August 2011 and June 2013, with Occupational Exposures (OEs) (cases) and those without (controls) were included. Demographic information was collected from infection control committee documents. A questionnaire was used to ask the HCWs about their awareness of preventive measures. HCWs who work with intensive work loads such as those found in emergency departments or intensive care units have a higher risk of OEs. Having heavy workloads and hours increases the risk of percutaneous and mucocutaneous exposures. For that reason the most common occupation groups are nurses and cleaning staff who are at risk of OEs. Increasing work experience has reduced the frequency of OEs.","authors":["T\u00fcre, Zeynep","Ulu Kili\u00e7, Ay\u015feg\u00fcl","Cevahir, Fatma","Altun, Dilek","\u00d6zhan, Esra","Alp, Emine"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jegh.2015.06.003","first_seen_on":"2015-10-12T01:54:58+00:00","issns":["2210-6014"],"journal":"Journal of epidemiology and global health","last_mentioned_on":1438131326,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26164279","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jegh.2015.06.003"],"pmid":"26164279","title":"Predictive factors for percutaneous and mucocutaneous exposure among healthcare workers in a developing country.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/predictive-factors-percutaneous-mucocutaneous-exposure-among-healthcare-workers-developing-country"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Earth and Planetary Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Predictive factors for percutaneous and mucocutaneous exposure among healthcare workers in a...","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=995578957148453&id=244445175595172","license":"public","citation_ids":[4612520],"posted_on":"2015-07-29T00:55:26+00:00","summary":"Predictive factors for percutaneous and mucocutaneous exposure among healthcare workers in a developing country.\n\nJ Epidemiol Glob Health. 2015 Jul 8. pii: S2210-6006(15)00065-9.\n\nT\u00fcre Z1, Ulu Kili\u00e7 A2, Cevahir F3, Altun D3, \u00d6zhan E3, Alp E2.\n\n1Department","author":{"name":"SIGN Moderator","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/244445175595172","facebook_wall_name":"SIGN Moderator","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/244445175595172\/picture","id_on_source":"244445175595172"}}]}}
