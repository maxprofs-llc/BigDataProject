The corpus contains three cohorts: patients who have a diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) in their first record, and continue to have it in subsequent records; patients who do not have a diagnosis of CAD in the first record, but develop it by the last record; patients who do not have a diagnosis of CAD in any record. This paper details the process used to select records for this corpus and provides an overview of novel research uses for this corpus. This corpus is the only annotated corpus of longitudinal clinical narratives currently available for research to the general research community.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6213cf058f610007b98","authors":["Kumar, Vishesh","Stubbs, Amber","Shaw, Stanley","Uzuner, Ozlem"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jbi.2015.09.018","first_seen_on":"2015-10-12T08:23:40+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms"],"issns":["1532-0480"],"journal":"Journal of Biomedical Informatics","last_mentioned_on":1444638204,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26433122"],"pmid":"26433122","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Physical Sciences","Computer Science"],"subjects":["medicalinformatics"],"title":"Creation of a new longitudinal corpus of clinical narratives.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/creation-new-longitudinal-corpus-clinical-narratives"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6234713,"mean":5.9745416737794,"rank":4611043,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":935655,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6234713,"percentile":15},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194341,"mean":10.306351559123,"rank":132061,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":41665,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194341,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":731,"mean":2.8862821917808,"rank":510,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":731,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":2.2980769230769,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
