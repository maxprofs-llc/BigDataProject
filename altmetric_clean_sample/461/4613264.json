We aim to investigate the effect of resveratrol on improving treatment outcomes of delayed r-tPA administration.\nPatients were randomly divided according to their onset-to-treatment time (OTT), as early OTT or delayed OTT. Then, they were either treated with r-tPA + placebo or with r-tPA + resveratrol. Twenty-four hours after the treatment, outcomes were assessed with NIH stroke scale (NIHSS), and plasma levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were also examined with ELISA.\nIn patients receiving delayed r-tPA treatment, co-administration of resveratrol significantly improves their treatment outcomes compared with those receiving placebo, as indicated by improved NIHSS scores. This improved outcome was be caused by resveratrol-induced reduction in plasma levels of both matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9, as a positive correlation was observed between reductions in both MMPs and patient NIHSS scores.\nResveratrol could be potentially administered as an adjuvant with r-tPA treatment, which extends the clinical therapeutic window of r-tPA, therefore improving the outcome of patients receiving late stroke treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002158","authors":["Chen, J.","Bai, Q.","Zhao, Z.","Sui, H.","Xie, X."],"doi":"10.1111\/ane.12511","endpage":"60","first_seen_on":"2015-10-12T09:20:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1600-0404"],"issue":"1","journal":"Acta Neurologica Scandinavica","last_mentioned_on":1464932414,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/ane.12511","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ane.12511\/abstract?campaign=woletoc"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ane.12511\/pdf","pmid":"26455907","pubdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"54","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Resveratrol improves delayed r\u2010tPA treatment outcome by reducing MMPs","type":"article","volume":"134","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/resveratrol-improves-delayed-rtpa-treatment-outcome-reducing-mmps"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7849747,"mean":6.6509658923939,"rank":3885968,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3764742,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7849747,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241078,"mean":9.435482074192,"rank":114407,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":116623,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241078,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1061,"mean":3.262858490566,"rank":615,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":419,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1061,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":2.4380434782609,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
