In this study, we aimed to explore the factors affecting early wound complications after tympanoplasty for chronic otitis media.\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Diagnosis Procedure Combination database. Data on a total of 13,094 adult patients from 420 acute-care hospitals who received tympanoplasty for chronic otitis media from 2010 to 2013 were extracted. The duration (days) of postsurgical local wound treatment was measured as an outcome, because this duration was assumed to be prolonged by the existence of wound infection. The associations between treatment duration and background characteristics (age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, diabetes mellitus, use of antithrombotic agents, with or without cholesteatoma, duration of anesthesia, academic hospital or not, and hospital volume) were assessed by multivariable linear regression analyses, fitted with a generalized estimating equation to adjust for within-hospital clustering.\nThe median treatment duration in each hospital was 8 days (interquartile range: 7-11). Factors significantly associated with longer treatment duration were: older age (0.2 days for 10-year increase), use of antithrombotic agents during hospitalization (1.8 days), and prolonged duration of anesthesia (vs. <120min of anesthesia, additional 1, 2, 3, and 4 days for 120-179, 180-239, 240-299, and \u2265300min of anesthesia, respectively). Body mass index and smoking status were not significantly associated with treatment duration.\nOlder age, antithrombotic agents during hospitalization, and longer anesthesia time were independently associated with early local wound complications after tympanoplasty for chronic otitis media.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002356","authors":["Suzuki, Sayaka","Yasunaga, Hideo","Matsui, Hiroki","Fushimi, Kiyohide","Yamasoba, Tatsuya"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.anl.2015.09.006","first_seen_on":"2015-10-13T10:05:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-1476"],"journal":"Auris Nasus Larynx","last_mentioned_on":1444758782,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26456142?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26456142?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26456142","pubdate":"2015-10-13T22:00:57+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"Factors associated with prolonged duration of post-tympanoplasty local treatment in adult chronic otitis media patients: A retrospective observational study using a Japanese inpatient database.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/factors-associated-prolonged-duration-posttympanoplasty-local-treatment-adult-chronic-otitis-media-p-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6237522,"mean":5.9780720020044,"rank":2741907,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3329827,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6237522,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193994,"mean":10.313187104689,"rank":93454,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":92219,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193994,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":312,"mean":1.417498392283,"rank":84,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":312,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":1.1041666666667,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/statuses\/653873845254774784","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4617234],"posted_on":"2015-10-13T10:04:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
