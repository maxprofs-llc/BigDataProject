The background evidence for this approach is limited. We evaluated whether on presentation and 4-hour high-sensitivity troponin I (hs-cTnI) could be used to accurately rule-out AMI.\nhs-cTnI was measured on presentation and at 4-hours in adult patients attending an emergency department with possible acute coronary syndrome. We determined the sensitivity for AMI for at least one hs-cTnI above the 99th percentile for a healthy population or alone or in combination with new ischemic ECG changes. Both overall and sex-specific 99th percentiles were assessed.. Patients with negative tests were designated low-risk.\n63 (17.1%) of 368 patients had AMI. The median (interquartile range) time from symptom onset to first blood sampling was 4.8hours (2.8-8.6). The sensitivity of the presentation and 4h hs-cTnI using the overall 99th percentile was 92.1% (95% CI 82.4% to 97.4%) and Negative Predictive Value 95.4% (92.3% to 97.4%) with 78.3% low-risk. Applying the sex-specific 99th percentile did not change the sensitivity. The addition of ECG did not change the sensitivity. d) Conclusion: Hs-cTnI >99th percentile thresholds measured on presentation and at 4-hours was not a safe strategy to rule-out AMI in this clinical setting irrespective of whether sex-specific 99th percentiles were used, or whether hs-cTnI was combined with ECG results.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f61000377d","authors":["Pickering, John W","Young, Joanna M","George, Peter","Aldous, Sally","Cullen, Louise","Greenslade, Jaimi H","Richards, A Mark","Troughton, Richard","Ardagh, Michael","Frampton, Christopher M","Than, Martin P","John W.
