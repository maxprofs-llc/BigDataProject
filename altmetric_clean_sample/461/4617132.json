The cognitive domains assessed included memory, attention, verbal fluency, processing speed and executive functions. Cognitive performances were compared with those of a control group (40 healthy control subjects), both in depression and in euthymia.\nPatients scored worse than control subjects in several cognitive domains, both in depression and euthymia. The most impaired cognitive functions were executive functions and verbal memory. Between the two moments of assessment bipolar patients obtained a significant improvement in memory, verbal fluency, attention and information processing speed. Psychomotor speed showed no difference between depression and euthymia.\nBipolar patients showed impairment in several cognitive domains during depression. A certain degree of impairment remained even after the remission of the affective episode in relationship with the executive functions. Between depression and euthymia, bipolar patients showed important cognitive improvements.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000794","authors":["Ramona P\u0103unescu","Ioana Miclu\u0163ia"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12991-015-0070-2","first_seen_on":"2015-10-13T09:51:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1744-859X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Annals of General Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1447875623,"links":["http:\/\/www.annals-general-psychiatry.com\/content\/14\/1\/32"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.annals-general-psychiatry.com\/content\/pdf\/s12991-015-0070-2.pdf","pmid":"26464576","pubdate":"2015-10-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychiatry","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"32","title":"Outcome of cognitive performances in bipolar euthymic patients after a depressive episode: a longitudinal naturalistic study","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/outcome-cognitive-performances-bipolar-euthymic-patients-after-depressive-episode-longitudinal-natur"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8384697,"mean":7.0640567748593,"rank":3308270,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5040137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8384697,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244017,"mean":9.6179626335977,"rank":77203,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":165287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244017,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":265,"mean":5.5466287878788,"rank":100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":162,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":265,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":3.5916666666667,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
