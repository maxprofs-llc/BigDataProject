Although mammography screening behaviors of immigrant populations compared to the general population have been widely studied, evidence of the specific characteristics within the immigrant population in a universal healthcare setting, which explain differential uptake is lacking. The current cross sectional study used self-reported data from the 2011-2012 Canadian Community Health Survey to examine the association between recency of immigration and mammography uptake among 1825 immigrant women aged 50-69\u00a0years, using multivariable logistic model adjusted for confounders. In the adjusted analysis, non-recent immigrants had a nonsignificantly increased odds of recent mammography uptake, 1.19 (95\u00a0% CI 0.41, 3.44) compared to recent immigrants. In the face of evidence depicting differential health care utilization of recent immigrants compared to non-recent ones or the general population, findings from this study highlight further thinking into strategies for improving the health of immigrants.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dee","authors":["Adu, Prince A","Ukah, U Vivian","Palmer, Sheena D"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10903-015-0298-6","first_seen_on":"2015-10-12T10:24:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1557-1920"],"journal":"Journal of Immigrant & Minority Health","last_mentioned_on":1444645446,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26454743?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26454743","pubdate":"2015-10-12T22:00:10+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Sociology, general","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth","socialsciences"],"title":"Association Between Recency of Immigration and Mammography Uptake: Results from a Canadian National Survey.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-between-recency-immigration-mammography-uptake-results-canadian-national-survey"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6235608,"mean":5.9756862326334,"rank":5299965,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6235608,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194355,"mean":10.3081012894,"rank":152692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194355,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":476,"mean":2.8031621052632,"rank":392,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":476,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":7.1657894736842,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Computer Science":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/653516485281714176","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4613463],"posted_on":"2015-10-12T10:24:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":726},"tweet_id":"653516485281714176"}]}}
