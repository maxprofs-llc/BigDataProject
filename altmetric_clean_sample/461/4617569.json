Consumed eggs hatch into oncospheres, penetrate the intestinal walls and are transported via the bloodstream to later develop into metacestodes within the muscles and internal organs of secondary and sometimes primary hosts, thereby initiating the cycle again. Larval stages of both Taenia spp and Echinococcus spp are well known to produce tissue-dwelling, long-lasting infections, in this stage, these parasites can reach centimeters (macroparasites) and both genera may cause life-threatening diseases in humans. Establishing such long term infections requires an exceptional ability to modulate host immunity for long periods of time. In this review we analyse the immune regulatory mechanisms induced by these tapeworms and their products, mainly discussing the importance of taeniid strategies to successfully colonize their hosts, such as antigen-presenting cell phenotype manipulation and the consequent induction of T-cell anergy, among others.
