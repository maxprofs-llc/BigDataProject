Interferences from endogenous components and, if necessary, from major metabolites as well as possible co-administered medications should be evaluated during a selectivity test. This paper describes a simple, rapid and cost-effective HPLC-UV method for the determination of naproxen in human plasma in the presence of two other analgesics, ibuprofen and paracetamol. Sample preparation is based on a simple liquid-liquid extraction procedure with a short, 5\u2009s mixing time. Fenoprofen, which is characterized by a similar structure and properties to naproxen, was first used as the internal standard. The calibration curve is linear in the concentration range of 0.5-80.0\u2009\u00b5g\/mL which is suitable for the pharmacokinetic studies following a single 220\u2009mg oral dose of naproxen sodium. The method was fully validated according to international guidelines and was successfully applied in a bioequivalence study in humans. This article is protected by copyright.
