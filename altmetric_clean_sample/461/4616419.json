We studied BC measurements, approximated by particulate matter (PM2.5 ) absorbance, in rural Yunnan province, China whose residents use a variety of solid fuels for cooking and heating including: bituminous and anthracite coal, and wood.\nMeasurements were taken over 2 consecutive 24 h periods from 163 households in 30 villages. PM2.5 absorbance (PMabs ) was measured using an EEL 043 Smoke Stain Reflectometer.\nPMabs measurements were higher in wood burning households (16.3 x 10(-5) m(-1) ) than bituminous and anthracite coal households (12 and 5.1 x 10(-5) m(-1) respectively). Among bituminous coal users, measurements varied by a factor of two depending on the coal source. Portable stoves (which are lit outdoors and brought indoors for use) were associated with reduced PMabs levels, but no other impact of stove design was observed. Outdoor measurements were positively correlated with and approximately half the level of indoor measurements (r= 0.49, p<0.01).\nMeasurements of BC (as approximated by PMabs ) in this population are modulated by fuel type and source. This provides valuable insight into potential morbidity, mortality and climate change contributions of domestic usage of solid fuels. This article is protected by copyright.
