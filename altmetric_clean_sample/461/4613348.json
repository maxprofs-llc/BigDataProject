Structural abnormalities and dysfunction of the digestive and respiratory systems were summarized across relevant studies by system and age group.\nPrimary studies (125 total) from 22 countries described abnormalities, dysfunction, and disease progression in infancy and early childhood. Improved health was consistently observed in association with diagnosis via newborn screening compared with cohorts diagnosed later by symptomatic presentation.\nThe peer-reviewed literature is remarkably consistent: CF-associated growth impairment and airway abnormalities are reported at birth, and disease progression is reported in infancy and throughout childhood. Earlier access to routine CF management is associated with improved subsequent health status.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d49","authors":["VanDevanter, Donald R","Kahle, Jennifer S","O'Sullivan, Amy K","Sikirica, Slaven","Hodgkins, Paul S"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jcf.2015.09.008","first_seen_on":"2015-10-12T10:01:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-5010","15691993"],"journal":"Journal of Cystic Fibrosis","last_mentioned_on":1450830056,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26454351?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26454351\/","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S1569199315002167&_version=1&md5=6c70e508d0918fbb08aeca50d1d1d7dc"],"pmid":"26454351","pubdate":"2015-10-12T22:00:19+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Cystic fibrosis in young children: A review of disease manifestation, progression, and response to early treatment ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cystic-fibrosis-young-children-review-disease-manifestation-progression-response-early-treatment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6818838,"mean":6.1901666501164,"rank":2602343,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4114940,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6818838,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236162,"mean":9.259743878117,"rank":85559,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":146239,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236162,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":650,"mean":1.4917904468413,"rank":134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":508,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":650,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.4666666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
