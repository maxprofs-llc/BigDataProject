Multiple vessel-crossing points served as landmarks.\nThe mean (\u00b1 SD; range) scaling factor between cSLO and FFC images (by GRADOR) for the horizontal dimension was 1.217 (\u00b1 0.0487; 1.0474-1.272) versus 1.138 (\u00b1 0.0311; 1.0841-1.193) for the vertical dimension. The mean percentage difference between horizontal and vertical scaling factors was 7.48 (\u00b1 2.29; 2.30-10.70). Refractive error (focus) and aperture size (or field of view of the image) were positively correlated and aspect ratio was negatively correlated with landmark pair measurements.\nInherent image-scaling differences between fundus autofluorescence imaging systems are not restricted to simple pixel-to-millimeter calibration variances, but appear to vary depending on measurement orientation. Differences should be considered when comparing measurements obtained using different imaging systems, particularly for clinical trials.
