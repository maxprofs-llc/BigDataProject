During the last decade, posttranslational modifications have emerged as critical regulators of synaptic transmission and plasticity. Notably, phosphorylation, ubiquitination and palmitoylation control the stability, trafficking and synaptic expression of glutamate receptors in the central nervous system. In the current review, we will summarize some of the progress made by the neuroscience community regarding our understanding of phosphorylation, ubiquitination and palmitoylation of the NMDA and AMPA subtypes of glutamate receptors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Lussier, Marc P","Sanz-Clemente, Antonio","Roche, Katherine W"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.r115.652750","first_seen_on":"2015-10-11T10:55:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1083-351X"],"journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1445037349,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26453298?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/early\/2015\/10\/09\/jbc.R115.652750.abstract"],"pmid":"26453298","pubdate":"2015-10-11T22:00:26+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Dynamic Regulation of NMDA and AMPA Receptors by Posttranslational Modifications","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dynamic-regulation-ini-methyldaspartate-nmda-%CE%B1amino3hydroxy5methyl4isoxazolepropionic-acid-ampa-rece"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6258277,"mean":5.9890807040159,"rank":2307310,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":3859972,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6258277,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194012,"mean":10.316762925814,"rank":74264,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":116140,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194012,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28900,"mean":3.0552666874286,"rank":18674,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":9958,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28900,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":382,"mean":5.0154855643045,"rank":135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":242,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":382,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
