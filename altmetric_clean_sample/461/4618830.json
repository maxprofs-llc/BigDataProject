Purpose of this study is to identify a single compound with an anti-HCV activity from natural products and to elucidate its mode of antiviral action at molecular levels.\nLuciferase reporter and RT-PCR assays were used to measure HCV replication. Western blot, fluorescence-labelled HCV replicons and infectious clones were employed to quantitate expression levels of viral proteins. Resistant HCV mutant mapping, in vitro NS3 protease, helicase, NS5B polymerase, and drug affinity responsive target stability assays were also used to study the antiviral mechanism.\nA resveratrol tetramer, vitisin B from grapevine root extract (GRE) showed single-digit nanomolar potency against HCV replication (EC50 \u2009=\u20096 nM and CC50 \u2009>\u200910\u2009\u03bcM). Combined treatment of vitisin B with an NS5B polymerase inhibitor (sofosbuvir) exhibited a synergistic or at least additive antiviral activity. Analysis of a number of vitisin B-resistant HCV variants suggested an NS3 helicase as its potential target. We confirmed a direct binding between vitisin B and a purified NS3 helicase in vitro. We also found a potent inhibitory activity of vitisin B against an HCV NS3 helicase (IC50 \u2009=\u20093 nM). Finally, we observed a preferred tissue distribution of vitisin B in the liver after a peritoneal injection into rats at clinically attainable concentrations.\nVitisin B is one of the most potent HCV helicase inhibitors identified far. Vitisin B is thus a prime candidate to be developed as the first HCV drug derived from natural products. This article is protected by copyright.
