We assessed the potential role of contralateral treatment to prolong the benefits obtained with the first procedure.\nThis was a retrospective multicenter study including consecutive patients with heterogeneous emphysema undergoing bronchoscopic valves deployment during the last 4 years. Patients were split into two groups depending on the procedure (unilateral versus bilateral). The intergroup differences were evaluated to assess the viability, effectiveness, and safety of the bilateral procedure.\nForty-nine patients were enrolled. Of these, 14 (28%) had a sequential bilateral procedure mainly due to loss of the clinical benefits obtained with the first treatment. A significant improvement of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (p < 0.05), forced vital capacity (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), residual volume (p < 0.05), 6-minute walking test (p\u00a0< 0.05), and St. George respiratory questionnaire (p\u00a0< 0.02) was achieved after the second procedure. These results were maintained during follow-up. There was no\u00a0significant difference regarding the changes of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (p\u00a0= 0.4), forced vital capacity (p\u00a0= 0.08), residual volume (p\u00a0= 0.9), 6-minute walking test (p\u00a0= 0.3), and St. George respiratory questionnaire (p\u00a0= 0.1) between the bilateral and unilateral groups.\nA sequential bilateral approach seems to be a valid strategy to improve respiratory function in patients with bilateral heterogeneous emphysema who have lost the benefits obtained with the first procedure.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a35","authors":["Fiorelli, Alfonso","D'Andrilli, Antonio","Anile, Marco","Diso, Daniele","Poggi, Camilla","Polverino, Mario","Failla, Giuseppe","Venuta, Federico","Rendina, Erino Angelo","Santini, Mario","Alfonso Fiorelli","Antonio D\u2019Andrilli","Marco Anile","Daniele Diso","Camilla Poggi","Mario Polverino","Giuseppe Failla","Federico Venuta","Erino Angelo Rendina","Mario Santini"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.athoracsur.2016.02.018","first_seen_on":"2016-05-22T10:41:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1552-6259","00034975"],"journal":"The Annals of Thoracic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1490361280,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27207390?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27207390?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27207390","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Sequential Bilateral Bronchoscopic Lung Volume Reduction With One-Way Valves for Heterogeneous Emphysema","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0003497516001946","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sequential-bilateral-bronchoscopic-lung-volume-reduction-oneway-valves-heterogeneous-emphysema"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":6381727,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1141370,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":273486,"mean":11.67301272099,"rank":189886,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":47190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":273486,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3496,"mean":3.8213310443491,"rank":1960,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1152,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3496,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177,"mean":5.345875,"rank":85,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":72,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Decision Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/statuses\/734324964107517952","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8111326],"posted_on":"2016-05-22T10:08:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":441},"tweet_id":"734324964107517952"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/LungEOPH\/statuses\/845262589428948992","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8111326],"posted_on":"2017-03-24T13:14:40+00:00","author":{"name":"Lung EOPH_papers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"LungEOPH","tweeter_id":"781025640191516673","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":17},"tweet_id":"845262589428948992"}]}}
