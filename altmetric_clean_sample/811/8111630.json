Our aim was to determine whether this phage could be used as an alternative therapeutic agent against multi-drug resistant bacteria strains specifically CRAB clinical isolates using a mouse model. Ten bacteriophages that caused lysis in CRAB strains including blaOXA66 -like genes were isolated. YMC13\/01\/C62 ABA BP (phage B\u03d5-C62), which shown strongest lysis activity, was chosen for further study: transmission electron microscopy (TEM), host range, one-step growth and phage adsorption rate, thermal and pH stability, bacteriolytic activity test, genome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, and therapeutic effect of phage using mouse intranasal infection model. The phage B\u03d5-C62 displayed high stability at various temperatures and pH values, and strong cell lysis activity in vitro The phage B\u03d5-C62 genome has a double-stranded linear DNA with a length of 44,844 bp, and known virulence genes were not identified in silico In vivo study showed that mouse treated with phage B\u03d5-C62 survived completely after intranasal bacterial challenge. Bacterial clearance in the lung was observed within 3 days after bacterial challenge, and histologic damage also improved significantly; moreover, no side effects were observed.\nIn our study, the novel A. baumannii phage B\u03d5-C62 was characterized and evaluated in vitro, in silico and in vivo These results including strong lytic activities and the improvement of survival rates showed its therapeutic potential of the phage B\u03d5-C62 as an antimicrobial agent. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the potential of a novel phage as a therapeutic candidate or non-toxic disinfectant against CRAB clinical isolates in vitro and in vivo.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022c6","authors":["Jeon, Jongsoo","Ryu, Choong-Min","Lee, Jun-Young","Park, Jong-Hwan","Yong, Dongeun","Lee, Kyungwon","Jongsoo Jeon","Choong-Min Ryu","Jun-young Lee","Jong-hwan Park","Dongeun Yong","Kyungwon Lee","Jun-Young Lee","Jong-Hwan Park","T.
