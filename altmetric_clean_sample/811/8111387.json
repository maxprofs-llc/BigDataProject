In the present study, 186 cats from three non-commercial catteries in S\u00e3o Paulo, SP, Brazil were evaluated. The detection of C. felis was performed by PCR. The clinical severity was scored from 1 to 4, with a score of 4 as the most severe manifestation. The total occurrence of C. felis was of 18.82% (35\/186) of cats overall, but notably, 58.06% (18\/31) of infected cats originated from a single cattery. All animals harboring C. felis had URTD clinical signs and higher scores (3 and 4). In addition, C. felis occurrence was associated with the presence of cryptic plasmid. However, the virulence and clinical severity were not correlated.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5043cf058f6100030c4","authors":["Gonsales, F F","Brand\u00e3o, P E","Melville, P A","Zuniga, E","Benites, N R"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.micpath.2016.05.009","first_seen_on":"2016-05-22T10:44:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1096-1208","08824010"],"journal":"Microbial Pathogenesis","last_mentioned_on":1463911988,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27208751?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27208751","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology","communicablediseases"],"title":"Chlamydia felis: Lack of association between clinical signs and the presence of the cryptic plasmid","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chlamydia-felis-lack-association-between-clinical-signs-presence-cryptic-plasmid"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7729992,"mean":6.6289680453638,"rank":5845636,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1042925,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7729992,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268456,"mean":11.466635749008,"rank":187610,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":44616,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268456,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":540,"mean":2.3802782931354,"rank":319,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":133,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":540,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":3.3291111111111,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
