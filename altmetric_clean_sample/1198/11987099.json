There is unquestionably a large volume of electronic health information available to healthcare practitioners, and there is evidence to suggest that the application of health information to patient care may improve patient and clinical outcomes. Despite this abundance of information, suboptimal care is common; thus it is important to determine how to encourage practitioners to use electronic health information to inform patient care.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e38","authors":["Bradford, Natalie K."],"doi":"10.1097\/xeb.0000000000000074","endpage":"137","first_seen_on":"2016-09-14T05:42:42+00:00","issns":["1744-1609"],"issue":"Medication Safety Issue: 3","journal":"International Journal of Evidence-Based Healthcare","last_mentioned_on":1473831745,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/ijebh\/Citation\/2016\/09000\/Interventions_to_increase_the_use_of_electronic.6.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/ijebh\/2016\/09000\/Interventions_to_increase_the_use_of_electronic.6.pdf","pmid":"26866735","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"136","subjects":["healthservices"],"title":"Interventions to increase the use of electronic health information by healthcare practitioners to improve clinical practice and patient outcomes","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/ijebh\/Fulltext\/2016\/09000\/Interventions_to_increase_the_use_of_electronic.6.aspx","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interventions-increase-electronic-health-information-healthcare-practitioners-improve-clinical-pract"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8380241,"mean":7.0622268827546,"rank":4472529,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2331927,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8380241,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251853,"mean":12.452884154185,"rank":138710,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":88706,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251853,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":154,"mean":3.8080130718954,"rank":88,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":154,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":4.926,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IJEBH\/statuses\/775932697025781760","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[11987099],"posted_on":"2016-09-14T05:42:25+00:00","author":{"name":"IJEBH","url":"http:\/\/www.ijebh.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/568386819025149952\/Jwv3AoR6_normal.jpeg","description":"Publishes reliable evidence to assist health professionals in their decision-making and to inform health professionals, students and researchers.","id_on_source":"IJEBH","tweeter_id":"3044804499","geo":{"lt":-34.92866,"ln":138.59863,"country":"AU"},"followers":204},"tweet_id":"775932697025781760"}]}}
