Oxidatively triggered disproportionation of cis-1 yields elemental copper and the mononuclear copper(II) complex CuL2 (trans-2). One-electron reduction of trans-2 gives cuprate [2](-) with a bent bis(pyrrolato) coordinated copper(I) entity. The imine donor atoms of [2](-) can insert an additional copper(I) ion giving exclusively the bimetallic complex cis-1 closing the oxidation-elimination-reduction-insertion cycle.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Oliver Back"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.6b01400","first_seen_on":"2016-09-13T19:28:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0020-1669","1520-510X"],"journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1473802252,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.6b01400"],"pmid":"27622744","pubdate":"2016-09-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Photochemistry and Redox Chemistry of an Unsymmetrical Bimetallic Copper(I) Complex","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/photochemistry-redox-chemistry-unsymmetrical-bimetallic-copperi-complex"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372629,"mean":7.0578283965246,"rank":6353808,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1135058,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372629,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252190,"mean":12.435333460222,"rank":177610,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":42825,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252190,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9257,"mean":1.14167653414,"rank":3960,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":4005,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9257,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":385,"mean":1.0522135416667,"rank":178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":145,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":385,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
