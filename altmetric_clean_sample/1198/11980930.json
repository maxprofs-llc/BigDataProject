Differences in metabolic risk factors by urban\/rural residence included overweight or obesity, triglycerides (\u22651.71mmol\/l), HDL-c (< 1.04 mmol\/l), alcohol intake, and physical inactivity (p < 0.01 respectively). There was significant difference regarding the prevalence of HbA1c >8% (48.1% versus 54.5%, p = 0.019) between rural and urban diabetic participants. No significant difference in the prevalence of type 2 diabetic complications between urban and rural participants (74.9% versus 72.2%; p = 0.263) was detected. Compared to rural participants, the most prevalent modifiable risk factors associated with diabetic complications in urban participants were obesity (BMI \u2265 28 Kg\/m2), HDL-c (< 1.04 mmol\/l), physical inactivity and irregular eating habits (p = 0.035, p = 0.001, p < 0.001, and p = 0.013, respectively).\nUrban settlers were significantly more likely to have metabolic risk factors highlighting the need for public health efforts to improve health outcomes for these vulnerable populations. Diabetes related complications risk factors were prevalent amongst rural and urban diabetes settlers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Guo-li Du","Yin-xia Su","Hua Yao","Jun Zhu","Qi Ma","Ablikm Tuerdi","Xiao-dong He","Li Wang","Zhi-qiang Wang","Shan Xiao","Shu-xia Wang","Li-ping Su"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0162611","first_seen_on":"2016-09-13T17:54:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"9","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1473797406,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0162611","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0162611&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0162611.PDF","pmid":"27622506","pubdate":"2016-09-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0162611","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Metabolic Risk Factors of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Correlated Glycemic Control\/Complications: A Cross-Sectional Study between Rural and Urban Uygur Residents in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metabolic-risk-factors-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-correlated-glycemic-controlcomplications-crosssectio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372629,"mean":7.0578283965246,"rank":6353820,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1135045,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372629,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252190,"mean":12.435361811974,"rank":177617,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":42818,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252190,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115587,"mean":10.633845742564,"rank":84474,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":18157,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115587,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4206,"mean":9.826138882283,"rank":3232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":538,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4206,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
