Fifty-six cases diagnosed during this time period were included.\nAll cases were managed with vitreous biopsy\/vitrectomy, microscopy and undiluted vitreous culture, anti-microbial susceptibility of bacterial isolates and received intravitreal antibiotics.\nAnatomic and visual outcome of these cases, anti-microbial susceptibility pattern of intravitreal imipenem and outcome of cases injected with it.\nCommonest presentation was acute endophthalmitis following cataract surgery (27 eyes, 48.21%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in 33 eyes (58.93%; 95% C.I. 46.05% - 71.81%). Nineteen eyes (34%; 95% C.I. 21.59% - 46.41%) developed phthisis; 14 eyes (25%;95% C.I. 13.66%-36.34%) had vision <20\/200;17eyes (30.35%; 95% C.I. 18.31% - 42.39%) eyes had an ambulatory vision (Vision\u2009>\u200920\/200 (logMAR 1); 6 eyes (10.71%; 95% C.I. 2.61% - 18.81%) had a reading vision (vision\u2009>\u200920\/40. (logMAR 0.3). Trend was towards better anatomic (72.73% versus 40%)(p\u2009=\u20090.05) and visual improvement in the imipenem group (logMAR 3.94\u2009+\u20090.21 to 2.43\u2009+\u20091.4, p\u2009=\u20090.002), as compared to non-imipenem group ( logMAR 2.99\u2009+\u20091.3 to 2.55\u2009+\u20091.4, p\u2009=\u20090.13).\nOutcome of ceftazidime resistant Gram-negative endophthalmitis is poor. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the commonest isolated organism. All cases were sensitive to Imipenem. There was a trend towards better anatomic outcome in imipenem treated eyes.
