Pyoverdins are expected to complex ferric ions naturally present in cloud water, thus modifying their availability and photoreactivity. The spectroscopic properties and photoreactivity of Fe(III)-Pyo were investigated, with particular attention to their fate under solar irradiation, also studied through simulations. The photolysis of the Fe(III)-Pyo complex leads to the generation of Fe(II), with rates of formation ( ) of 6.98 and 3.96 \u00d7 10-9 M s-1 at pH 4.0 and 6.0, respectively. Interestingly, acetate formation was observed during the iron-complex photolysis, suggesting that fragmentation can occur after the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) via a complex reaction mechanism. Moreover, photogenerated Fe(II) represent an important source of hydroxyl radical via the Fenton reaction in cloud water. This reactivity might be relevant for the estimation of the rates of formation and steady-state concentrations of the hydroxyl radical by cloud chemistry models and for organic matter speciation in the cloud aqueous phase. In fact, the conventional models, which describe the iron photoreactivity in terms of iron-aqua and oxalate complexes, are not in accordance with our results.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027ef","authors":["Monica Passananti"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.est.6b02338","first_seen_on":"2016-08-31T13:09:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-5851","0013-936X"],"journal":"Environmental Science & Technology","last_mentioned_on":1472648966,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.est.6b02338"],"pmid":"27487120","pubdate":"2016-08-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Siderophores in Cloud Waters and Potential Impact on Atmospheric Chemistry: Photoreactivity of Iron Complexes under Sun-Simulated Conditions","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/siderophores-cloud-waters-potential-impact-atmospheric-chemistry-photoreactivity-iron-complexes-unde"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8307635,"mean":7.0030489970953,"rank":6303672,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1124332,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8307635,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251639,"mean":12.507616441078,"rank":178542,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":40379,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251639,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9439,"mean":10.080474464929,"rank":8344,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":450,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9439,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246,"mean":31.252416326531,"rank":209,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
