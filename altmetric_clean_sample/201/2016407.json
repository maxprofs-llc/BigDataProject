We demonstrated that the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) Dasatinib, used for chronic myeloid leukaemia, significantly blocks in vitro HIV1 production by 3.4 logs in HIV1-infected primary CD4 T lymphocytes, by inhibiting cell activation and proliferation, without cell toxicity. This molecule deserves to be investigated further for HIV cure strategies to hinder persistent immune activation and residual viral production.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006920","authors":["Manuela Pogliaghi","Laura Papagno","Sidonie Lambert","Ruxandra Calin","Vincent Calvez","Christine Katlama","Brigitte Autran"],"doi":"10.1097\/qad.0000000000000073","first_seen_on":"2014-01-02T18:21:41+00:00","issns":["1473-5571"],"journal":"AIDS","last_mentioned_on":1388686885,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24361684"],"pmid":"24361684","pubdate":"2013-12-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome"],"title":"The tyrosine kinase inhibitor Dasatinib blocks in-vitro HIV-1 production by primary CD4+ T cells from HIV-1 infected patients.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor-dasatinib-blocks-invitro-hiv1-production-primary-cd4-t-cells-hiv1-infected"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3066472,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":944694,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122833,"mean":7.6382688061745,"rank":81099,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":27474,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122833,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1878,"mean":2.9736110815131,"rank":1433,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":283,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1878,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":4.237756097561,"rank":73,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/rlfurler\/status\/418809269987713024","license":"public","citation_ids":[2016407],"posted_on":"2014-01-02T18:21:25+00:00","author":{"name":"Robert L.
