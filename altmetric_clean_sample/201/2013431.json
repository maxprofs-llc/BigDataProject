Persistently symptomatic patients worsen with a disabling, potentially fatal clinical course. To determine a possible infectious cause, we correlated in a case-control study the clinical information with the presence of bacterial DNA in sarcoidosis mediastinal lymph nodes compared with control lymph nodes resected during cancer surgery.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cc0","authors":["Lary A Robinson","Prudence Smith","Dhruba J SenGupta","Jennifer L Prentice","Ramon L Sandin"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmjopen-2013-004065","first_seen_on":"2013-12-31T20:27:56+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"12","journal":"BMJ Open","last_mentioned_on":1442444702,"links":["http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/cgi\/content\/short\/3\/12\/e004065","http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/3\/12\/e004065.long","http:\/\/m.bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/3\/12\/e004065"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/3\/12\/e004065.full.pdf","pmid":"24366580","pubdate":"2013-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"British Medical Journal Publishing Group","startpage":"e004065","title":"Molecular analysis of sarcoidosis lymph nodes for microorganisms: a case\u2013control study with clinical correlates","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-analysis-sarcoidosis-lymph-nodes-microorganisms-casecontrol-study-clinical-correlates"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6347318,"mean":5.839210139339,"rank":2334093,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":3919839,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6347318,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143731,"mean":7.8537224657345,"rank":50703,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":90341,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143731,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4164,"mean":14.91398270478,"rank":2402,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":1663,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4164,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":212,"mean":11.667763033175,"rank":96,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":212,"percentile":49}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2},"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Molecular analysis of sarcoidosis lymph nodes for microorganisms: a case\u2013control study with...","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/154239187974508\/posts\/616232208441868","license":"public","citation_ids":[2013431],"posted_on":"2013-12-31T20:27:06+00:00","summary":"Scientists\u2019 at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa FL are looking for a pathogenic cause in sarcoidosis cases.
