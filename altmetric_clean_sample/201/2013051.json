This study examined the influence of work distribution (varied load, set, and repetitions (reps)) on SRPE in two resistance exercise trials matched for total work volume (sets x reps x % 1RM) and work rate (total work volume\/time). Participants completed a low load\/high rep (LLHR) trial (2 sets x 12 reps x 3 min recovery at \u223c60% 1RM) and a high load\/low rep (HLLR) trial (3 sets x 6 reps x 1.5 min recovery at \u223c80% 1RM) of the bench press, lat pull down, overhead press, upright row, triceps extension, and biceps curl. A 2 min recovery separated each exercise in both trials. SRPE and recovery heart rate (HR) were recorded 20 min after exercise. Pre-set and post-set RPE and HR were higher for HLLR vs. LLHR (3.1 \u00b1 1.6; 104 \u00b1 15 bpm vs. 2.1 \u00b1 1.3; 98 \u00b1 10 bpm) and (5.5 \u00b1 0.9; 139 \u00b1 14 bpm vs. 4.4 \u00b1 0.9; 131 \u00b1 12 bpm) respectively. Session RPE was higher for HLLR (5.7 \u00b1 1.4) vs. LLHR (4.3 \u00b1 1.4) with no difference in recovery HR. SRPE was greater with higher load despite matched total volumes and work rates. Higher pre-set acute RPE and HR in HLLR may indicate differences in recovery between sets. Higher post-set acute RPE and HR in HLLR indicated increased difficulty of individual sets in HLLR which likely contributed to SRPE differences. Practitioners can be confident that SRPE accurately reflects changes in training load when the number of sets, reps, and loads are altered within routine training.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f6100040e2","doi":"10.1519\/jsc.0000000000000342","first_seen_on":"2013-12-31T14:27:03+00:00","issns":["1064-8011"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research","last_mentioned_on":1388500015,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Work_Distribution_Influences_Session_RPE_Response.97532.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/9000\/00000\/Work_Distribution_Influences_Session_RPE_Response.97532.pdf","pmid":"24378665","pubdate":"2013-12-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"","subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Work Distribution Influences Session RPE Response during Resistance Exercise Matched for Total Volume","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/work-distribution-influences-session-ratings-perceived-exertion-response-during-resistance-exercise"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3064044,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":943581,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122060,"mean":7.6526241735557,"rank":79944,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":27165,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122060,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2781,"mean":14.497304316547,"rank":2483,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":166,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2781,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111,"mean":25.521,"rank":108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
