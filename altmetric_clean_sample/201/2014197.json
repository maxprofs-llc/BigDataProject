This paper outlines a phenomenologically grounded ethnographic study of the experiences of ecstasy users in the Sydney, Australia, area. I espouse phenomenology as a framework for describing and understanding these experiences. A number of excerpts are presented from my primary corpus of ethnographic material. For the purposes of this paper I assemble user's reports into nine thematic areas: (1) initial reactions and peaking; (2) the rush; (3) plateau; (4) coming down\/scattering; (5) love; (6) peace, love, understanding, and respect; (7) connections on ecstasy; (8) unificatory experiences; (9) returning to baseline. The typical experiences presented in these reports confirm and extend interdisciplinary approaches to understanding ecstasy. I suggest that a context-specific approach that is phenomenologically attuned to user's experiences with ecstasy can contribute to the growing body of literature undertaken in the Australian and international research community.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f6100014f7","authors":["Sean Leneghan"],"first_seen_on":"2014-01-01T12:11:53+00:00","issns":["0279-1072"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Psychoactive Drugs","last_mentioned_on":1388587966,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24377174?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24377174","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychopharmacology","substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"The varieties of ecstasy experience: a phenomenological ethnography.","type":"article","volume":"45","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/varieties-ecstasy-experience-phenomenological-ethnography"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.95,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4748895,"mean":5.7051796502555,"rank":1739531,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3001667,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4748895,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127642,"mean":7.8830696249639,"rank":36532,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":90849,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127642,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":354,"mean":5.1131444759207,"rank":170,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":183,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":354,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":34.3355,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
