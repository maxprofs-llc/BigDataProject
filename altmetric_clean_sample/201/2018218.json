Menarche has been related to onset of mood symptoms, which at times have been described as menstrual psychoses and could represent an early presentation of Pediatric bipolar disorders. Pediatric bipolar disorders appear to be characterized by less clearly defined mood episodes, shorter duration of these episodes, and different hallmark symptoms than in adults. This report describes a pediatric patient who had no previous psychiatric symptoms and for whom menstrual psychosis was the presenting symptom of bipolar disorder not otherwise specified.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006ccb","authors":["Javier Santos-Cubi\u00f1\u00e1","Pedro A Castaing-Lespier","Nuria Sabat\u00e9","Ana Torres-Martin","Virgen M Qui\u00f1ones-Fernandini"],"first_seen_on":"2014-01-03T11:07:36+00:00","issns":["0004-4849"],"issue":"3","journal":"Boletin de la Asociacion Medica de Puerto Rico","last_mentioned_on":1388753893,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24282923?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24282923","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Menstrual psychosis: presenting symptom of bipolar disorder not otherwise specified in a 13-years-old Hispanic female.","type":"article","volume":"105","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/menstrual-psychosis-presenting-symptom-bipolar-disorder-not-otherwise-specified-13yearsold-hispanic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2911880,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1443556,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":32},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122484,"mean":7.6540088828657,"rank":76235,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":42326,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122484,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":1.5688372093023,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.925,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
