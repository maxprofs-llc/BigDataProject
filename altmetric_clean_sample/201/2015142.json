Similar peptides in other species have been implicated in diverse biological processes and are hypothesised to play a role in several aspects of plant development, plant responses to biotic or abiotic stress through their participation in hormone crosstalk, and redox homeostasis. To help resolve the biological roles of GSL1 and GSL2 peptides we have undertaken an in depth analysis of the structure and expression of these genes in potato.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b9","authors":["Meiyalaghan S","Thomson SJ","Fiers MW","Barrell PJ","Latimer JM","Mohan S","Jones EE","Conner AJ","Jacobs JM","Sathiyamoorthy Meiyalaghan","Susan J Thomson","Mark WEJ Fiers","Philippa J Barrell","Julie M Latimer","Sara Mohan","E Eirian Jones","Anthony J Conner","Jeanne ME Jacobs"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2164-15-2","first_seen_on":"2014-01-02T05:56:27+00:00","handle":"10182\/6953","handles":["10182\/6953"],"issns":["1471-2164",""],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1388645720,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/15\/2\/abstract","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/1471-2164-15-2"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2164-15-2.pdf","pmid":"24382166","pubdate":"2014-01-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"2","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Structure and expression of GSL1 and GSL2 genes encoding gibberellin stimulated-like proteins in diploid and highly heterozygous tetraploid potato reveals their highly conserved and essential status","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2164-15-2","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structure-expression-gsl1-gsl2-genes-encoding-gibberellin-stimulatedlike-proteins-diploid-highly-het"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627846,"mean":4.9453817817504,"rank":1810207,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1641094,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627846,"percentile":45},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111408,"mean":7.2149938334218,"rank":48140,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":56884,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111408,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3347,"mean":3.3200316796175,"rank":1701,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":1426,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3347,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201,"mean":4.06089,"rank":93,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":96,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
