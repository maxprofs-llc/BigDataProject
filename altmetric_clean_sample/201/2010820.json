The Team Emergency Assessment Measure (TEAM) was developed to enable standardized performance assessment and structured team debriefing. From several studies, the TEAM has demonstrated a substantial body of normative data confirming its validity and reliability. This includes high uni-dimensional validity, significant subscale relationships between Teamwork and Leadership and between Teamwork and Task Management (p<0.001), a Cronbach alpha of 0.92 and adequate construct validity. The tool has potential for team training to improve team's non-technical performance. Further testing is required in 'real' clinical settings.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003476","authors":["Cooper, Simon J.","Cant, Robyn P.","Simon J Cooper","Robyn P Cant"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.resuscitation.2013.08.276","first_seen_on":"2013-12-30T13:11:00+00:00","issns":["0300-9572","1873-1570"],"issue":"1","journal":"Resuscitation","last_mentioned_on":1462247233,"links":["http:\/\/www.resuscitationjournal.com\/article\/S0300-9572(13)00719-3\/abstract?elsca1=etoc&elsca2=email&elsca3=0300-9572_201401_85_1&elsca4=emergency_medicine#.UsFwrUz6EHo.facebook","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0300957213007193","https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/256610720_Measuring_non-technical_skills_of_medical_emergency_teams_An_update_on_the_validity_and_reliability_of_the_Team_Emergency_Assessment_Measure_TEAM"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.resuscitationjournal.com\/article\/S0300-9572(13)00719-3\/pdf","pmid":"24036193","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["emergencymedicine"],"title":"Measuring non-technical skills of medical emergency teams: An update on the validity and reliability of the Team Emergency Assessment Measure ","type":"article","volume":"85","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/measuring-nontechnical-skills-medical-emergency-teams-update-validity-reliability-team-emergency-ass"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7644999,"mean":6.5733031223765,"rank":3734752,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3715586,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7644999,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180231,"mean":7.0994790434447,"rank":76812,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":97494,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180231,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2101,"mean":8.8658552380952,"rank":1455,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":599,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2101,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":6.8116091954023,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
