We provide and will continue to encourage access to the GPC as an international resource. DNA and other biological samples and diagnostic data are available through the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Repository. After appropriate review and approval by an advisory board, investigators are able to collaborate in, propose, and co-lead studies involving cohort participants.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f61000697e","authors":["Michele T Pato","Janet L Sobell","Helena Medeiros","Colony Abbott","Brooke M Sklar","Peter F Buckley","Evelyn J Bromet","Michael A Escamilla","Ayman H Fanous","Douglas S Lehrer","Fabio Macciardi","Dolores Malaspina","Steve A McCarroll","Stephen R Marder","Jennifer Moran","Christopher P Morley","Humberto Nicolini","Diana O Perkins","Shaun M Purcell","Mark H Rapaport","Pamela Sklar","Jordan W Smoller","James A Knowles","Carlos N Pato","Pato MT","Sobell JL","Medeiros H","Abbott C","Sklar BM","Buckley PF","Bromet EJ","Escamilla MA","Fanous AH","Lehrer DS","Macciardi F","Malaspina D","McCarroll SA","Marder SR","Moran J","Morley CP","Nicolini H","Perkins DO","Purcell SM","Rapaport MH","Sklar P","Smoller JW","Knowles JA","Pato CN"],"doi":"10.1002\/ajmg.b.32160","first_seen_on":"2014-01-03T23:21:43+00:00","issns":["1552-485X","1552-4841"],"issue":"4","journal":"American Journal of Medical Genetics.
