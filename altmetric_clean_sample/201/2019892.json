Fifteen additional piperacillin\/tazobactam generic lots revealed an average of -10% activity (range, +3 to -23%) compared to the branded product (Zosyn\u00ae; Wyeth-Pfizer), a finding consistent with prior reports (46 lots) of -16%. In contrast, meropenem branded and generic products had equivalent assay results (5 generic lots from 2 manufacturers [Hospira and Sandoz]). In conclusion, potencies for generic lots of parenteral broad-spectrum \u03b2-lactams can vary widely when directly compared to branded products, requiring documentation by chemical, in vitro activity (potency assays as measured here), and purity testing before considering their addition to a hospital formulary.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026ff","authors":["Ronald N Jones","Helio S Sader","Robert K Flamm","Amy A Watters"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.diagmicrobio.2013.01.024","first_seen_on":"2014-01-04T06:49:20+00:00","issns":["1879-0070"],"issue":"1","journal":"Diagnostic Microbiology & Infectious Disease","last_mentioned_on":1388828589,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23490010?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23490010","pubdate":"2013-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology","communicablediseases"],"title":"More potency assay results for generic non-USA lots of piperacillin\/tazobactam and initial reports for generic meropenem compounds marketed in the USA.","type":"article","volume":"76","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/more-potency-assay-results-generic-nonusa-lots-piperacillintazobactam-initial-reports-generic-merope"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2911837,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1443587,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":32},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122472,"mean":7.6855184492658,"rank":76246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":42310,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122472,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":415,"mean":1.5393574879227,"rank":221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":178,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":415,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.4135789473684,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Professor":2,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Unspecified":2,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"CO":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ndm1bacteria\/status\/419359832051707905","license":"public","citation_ids":[2019892],"posted_on":"2014-01-04T06:49:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Dave Roberts","url":"http:\/\/www.ndm1bacteria.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1294321879\/713px-EscherichiaColi_NIAID_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"ndm1bacteria","tweeter_id":"177368473","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":548},"tweet_id":"419359832051707905"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Markusmicrobius\/status\/419403619713421313","license":"public","rt":["ndm1bacteria"],"citation_ids":[2019892],"posted_on":"2014-01-04T09:43:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Prof Mark Fielder","url":"http:\/\/microbialmuzzzings.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3371635456\/0fc5932628abec8c1449026f1146e673_normal.jpeg","description":"Prof Mark Fielder Professor of medical microbiology @ Kingston  President of the Society for Applied Microbiology","id_on_source":"Markusmicrobius","tweeter_id":"21748200","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1533},"tweet_id":"419403619713421313"}]}}
