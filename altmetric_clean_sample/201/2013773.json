Three bacterial strains were isolated from live ticks, and the genetic characterization of these strains suggests that they belong to two previously unknown species. The pathogenicity of these two new species of Bartonella is not yet known. The new isolates described here are the first strains of Bartonella spp. from soft ticks and the first isolates from any arthropod species in Africa.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036f2","authors":["Oleg Mediannikov","Georges Diatta","Kangaji Kasongo","Didier Raoult"],"doi":"10.1089\/vbz.2013.1326","first_seen_on":"2014-01-01T03:58:20+00:00","issns":["1557-7759"],"journal":"Vector Borne & Zoonotic Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1388548587,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24359424"],"pmid":"24359424","pubdate":"2013-12-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["epidemiology","communicablediseases"],"title":"Identification of Bartonellae in the Soft Tick Species Ornithodoros sonrai in Senegal.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-bartonellae-soft-tick-species-ornithodoros-sonrai-senegal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3617832,"mean":4.9276880009076,"rank":2903021,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":71539,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3617832,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110949,"mean":7.21238237733,"rank":87001,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":289,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110949,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":410,"mean":2.2629388753056,"rank":301,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":410,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":2.8262857142857,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
