Data on CRC incidence rates were derived from the National Cancer Registry, on food consumption from the national food balance sheets; data on alcohol and tobacco smoking reflected official statistics of the Central Statistical Office. It was shown that CRC incidence rates were increasing between 1960 and 1995, which could have been affected by adverse dietary patterns (growing consumption of edible fats, especially animal fats, sugar, red meat, and declining fibre and folate intake), high alcohol consumption, and frequent tobacco smoking noted until the end of the 1980s. Since 1990, the dietary pattern changed favourably (decrease in consumption of red meat, animal fats, and sugar, higher vitamin D intake, increase in vegetables and fruit quantities consumed, and decline in tobacco smoking). These changes could contribute to the stabilisation of CRC incidence among women seen after 1996 and a reduction in the rate of increase among men.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef852a83ee09648b548f","authors":["Miros\u0142aw Jarosz","W\u0142odzimierz Seku\u0142a","Ewa Rychlik"],"doi":"10.1155\/2013\/183204","first_seen_on":"2013-12-30T10:21:36+00:00","issns":["2314-6141"],"journal":"BioMed Research International","last_mentioned_on":1388398882,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24369529?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24369529","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Trends in Dietary Patterns, Alcohol Intake, Tobacco Smoking, and Colorectal Cancer in Polish Population in 1960-2008.","type":"article","volume":"2013","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/trends-dietary-patterns-alcohol-intake-tobacco-smoking-colorectal-cancer-polish-population-19602008-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4759378,"mean":5.7095406108846,"rank":3982611,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4759378,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127307,"mean":7.8963373917963,"rank":103400,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127307,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108,"mean":1.0060747663551,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/darmtag\/status\/417601297496694784","license":"public","citation_ids":[2010630],"posted_on":"2013-12-30T10:21:22+00:00","author":{"name":"Darmtag","url":"http:\/\/darmtag.wordpress.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000860007151\/bUdy376d_normal.png","id_on_source":"darmtag","tweeter_id":"580627607","geo":{"lt":52.5,"ln":13.41667,"country":"DE"},"followers":45},"tweet_id":"417601297496694784"}]}}
