We have been unable to isolate SRCAM 1580, and did not find any genetic determinants in the genome of this strain. We now report the reassignment of this activity to the lipopeptide tridecaptin A\u2081. Structural characterization of tridecaptin A1 was achieved through NMR, MS\/MS and GC-MS studies. The structure was confirmed through the first chemical synthesis of tridecaptin A\u2081, which also revealed the stereochemistry of the lipid chain. The impact of this stereochemistry on antimicrobial activity was examined. The biosynthetic machinery responsible for tridecaptin production was identified through bioinformatic analyses. P. terrae NRRL B-30644 also produces paenicidin B, a novel lantibiotic active against Gram-positive bacteria. MS\/MS analyses indicate that this lantibiotic is structurally similar to paenicidin A.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008dd9","authors":["Lohans, Christopher T.","van Belkum, Marco J.","Cochrane, Stephen A.","Huang, Zedu","Sit, Clarissa S.","McMullen, Lynn M.","Vederas, John C."],"doi":"10.1002\/cbic.201300595","endpage":"249","first_seen_on":"2013-12-30T14:55:54+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1439-7633","1439-4227"],"issue":"2","journal":"ChemBioChem","last_mentioned_on":1392674911,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cbic.201300595\/abstract;jsessionid=0C9CFA2685A94DC8E5ED478C891BBB97.f02t02","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/cbic.201300595","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cbic.201300595\/abstract;jsessionid=CA2443228B20D8BAC3C5C20239E9E5F5.f03t02"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cbic.201300595\/pdf","pmid":"24382692","pubdate":"2013-12-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"243","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Biochemical, Structural, and Genetic Characterization of Tridecaptin A1, an Antagonist of Campylobacter jejuni","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biochemical-structural-genetic-characterization-tridecaptin-1-antagonist-campylobacter-jejuni"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6335023,"mean":5.9768461059805,"rank":2249729,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4044752,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6335023,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":149789,"mean":7.6803366624832,"rank":49173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":99346,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":149789,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1515,"mean":2.0899577278732,"rank":228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":1281,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1515,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":1.6898928571429,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1,"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ChemBio_at_UofA\/status\/435534548953477121","license":"public","citation_ids":[2010939],"posted_on":"2014-02-17T22:01:42+00:00","author":{"name":"UofA ChemBio","url":"http:\/\/www.chemistry.ualberta.ca\/en\/Research\/ChemicalBiology.aspx","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000568452968\/5ce4610908fe7782ec2cd89766ba9285_normal.png","description":"Updates from the Chemical Biology Division at the University of Alberta, Department of Chemistry","id_on_source":"ChemBio_at_UofA","tweeter_id":"1947771690","geo":{"lt":53.55014,"ln":-113.46871,"country":"CA"},"followers":172},"tweet_id":"435534548953477121"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ChemBioChem\/status\/417670297987579904","license":"public","citation_ids":[2010939],"posted_on":"2013-12-30T14:55:33+00:00","author":{"name":"ChemBioChem","url":"http:\/\/www.chembiochem.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/593739816170315776\/4jf2AmgP_normal.png","description":"ChemBioChem is a source for important primary & secondary information in chemical biology, synthetic biology & bionanotechnology.
