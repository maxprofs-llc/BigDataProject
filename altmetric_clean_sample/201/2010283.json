Actoprotectors are regarded as a subclass of adaptogens that hold a significant capacity to increase physical performance. The focus of this article is studying adaptogen herbs of genus Panax (P. ginseng in particular) and their capabilities as actoprotectors. Some animal experiments and human studies about actoprotective properties of genus Panax attest that P. ginseng (administered as an extract) significantly increased the physical and intellectual work capacities, and the data provided suggests that ginseng is a natural source of actoprotectors. Preparations of ginseng can be regarded as potential actoprotectors which give way to further research of its influence on physical and mental work capacity, endurance and restoration after exhaustive physical loads while compared with reference actoprotectors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8f73cf058f61000c98f","authors":["Sergiy Oliynyk","Seikwan Oh"],"doi":"10.5142\/jgr.2013.37.144","endpage":"166","first_seen_on":"2013-12-30T03:37:20+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1226-8453"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Ginseng Research","last_mentioned_on":1419968340,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23717168","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3659633\/?report=classic","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3659633\/"],"pmcid":"PMC3659633","pmid":"23717168","pubdate":"2013-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","startpage":"144","title":"Actoprotective effect of ginseng: improving mental and physical performance","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/actoprotective-effect-ginseng-improving-mental-physical-performance"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691823,"mean":5.4318361211662,"rank":306208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":4384185,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691823,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123527,"mean":7.8507595000244,"rank":11099,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":112390,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123527,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":1.6606382978723,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
