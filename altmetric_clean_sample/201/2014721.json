Seventeen male volunteers entered into a double blind, randomized study to receive oral THC (10 mg t.i.d. for 3 days and on the morning of the fourth day) or placebo, after at least 2 weeks of abstinence. Plasma prolactin, ACTH, cortisol, luteinizing hormone and testosterone were not altered during or after THC, compared with baseline concentrations. Tests of lymphocyte function showed no differences compared to baseline between THC and placebo groups. As the relatively low dosing regimen of THC (10 mg t.i.d.) resulted in no alterations, another group of 6 men were administered higher doses of THC by inhalation (18 mg\/marijuana cigarette) following the same dosing regimen. No endocrine or immunological alterations were observed. When the subjects were grouped according to their history of THC use prior to admission, heavy THC users had lower prolactin concentrations than light users. No differences were observed in concentrations of other hormones or in tests of immune function.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e65","authors":["E M Dax","N S Pilotte","W H Adler","J E Nagel","W R Lange","Dax, E M","Pilotte, N S","Adler, W H","Nagel, J E","Lange, W R"],"first_seen_on":"2014-01-01T22:48:17+00:00","issns":["0022-4731"],"issue":"1-6","journal":"Journal of Steroid Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1477841496,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2560514"],"pmid":"2560514","pubdate":"1989-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"The effects of 9-ene-tetrahydrocannabinol on hormone release and immune function.","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-9enetetrahydrocannabinol-hormone-release-immune-function"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7621460,"mean":6.5607387299425,"rank":5766644,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1024016,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7621460,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":181096,"mean":7.0909230845691,"rank":115986,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":34251,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":181096,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126,"mean":4.140512,"rank":116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
