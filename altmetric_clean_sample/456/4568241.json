Despite this, there is clinical practice variation with imaging studies obtained for asymptomatic patients with a positive sentinel node (SN+). We characterize the utility, cost, and clinical implications of imaging studies obtained in asymptomatic SN+ patients.\nA retrospective review was performed of asymptomatic, clinically node-negative patients who were found to have a positive sentinel node after surgery. The type of imaging, subsequent tests\/interventions, frequency of additional malignancy detected, and costs were recorded.\nFrom April 2009 to April 2013, a total of 50 of 113 (44%) asymptomatic patients underwent staging imaging for a positive sentinel node; 11 (22%) patients had at least 1 subsequent imaging study or diagnostic intervention. No instance of metastatic breast cancer was identified, with a total cost of imaging calculated at $116,905.\nStaging imaging for asymptomatic SN+ breast cancer demonstrates clinical variation. These tests were associated with low utility, increased costs, and frequent false positives leading to subsequent testing\/intervention. Evidence-based standardization may help increase quality by decreasing unnecessary variation and cost.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000221f","authors":["Pellet, Andrew C","Erten, Mujde Z","James, Ted A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.amjsurg.2015.08.022","first_seen_on":"2015-09-30T01:32:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0002-9610","1879-1883"],"journal":"American Journal of Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1446981849,"links":["http:\/\/www.americanjournalofsurgery.com\/article\/S0002-9610(15)00544-9\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26545344?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.americanjournalofsurgery.com\/article\/S0002961015005449\/pdf","pmid":"26545344","pubdate":"2015-11-08T11:24:25+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Value analysis of postoperative staging imaging for asymptomatic, early-stage breast cancer: implications of clinical variation on utility and cost.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/value-analysis-postoperative-staging-imaging-asymptomatic-earlystage-breast-cancer-implications-clin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6535340,"mean":6.0620751486637,"rank":4593744,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1701552,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6535340,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":204099,"mean":10.095067643975,"rank":130798,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":63621,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":204099,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1568,"mean":2.7336975111678,"rank":827,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":625,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1568,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":1.79895,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/hiredmds\/statuses\/649033847623938048","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4568241],"posted_on":"2015-09-30T01:31:42+00:00","author":{"name":"MD\/DO Resident Jobs","url":"http:\/\/hiredmdresident.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/471722569159045120\/zjTOoCiB_normal.jpeg","description":"Jobs for graduating medical residents and fellows.","id_on_source":"hiredmds","tweeter_id":"2512746356","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":24948},"tweet_id":"649033847623938048"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/663316068643946497","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4568241],"posted_on":"2015-11-08T11:24:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":713},"tweet_id":"663316068643946497"}]}}
