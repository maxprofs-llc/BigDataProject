Their importance as pathogens has come to the fore in recent years, particularly in the context of the global emergence of hyper-virulent and antibiotic resistant strains. Despite this, the mechanisms underlying ExPEC transmission dynamics and clonal selection remain poorly understood. Large-scale epidemiological and clinical studies are urgently required to ascertain the mechanisms underlying these processes to enable the development of novel evidence-based preventative and therapeutic strategies. In the current review, we provide a concise summary of the methods utilised for ExPEC phylogenetic genetic delineation before exploring in detail the associations between ExPEC VFs and site-specific disease. We then consider the role of ExPEC as an intestinal colonist before outlining known associations between ExPEC clonal variation, specific disease syndromes and antibiotic resistance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c4","authors":["Dale, Adam P","Woodford, Neil"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jinf.2015.09.009","first_seen_on":"2015-09-28T10:00:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-2742"],"journal":"Journal of Infection","last_mentioned_on":1443563857,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26409905?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26409905?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26409905","pubdate":"2015-09-28T22:00:25+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Extra-Intestinal Pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC): Disease, Carriage and Clones.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/extraintestinal-pathogenic-escherichia-coli-expec-disease-carriage-clones"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6417983,"mean":5.8802166986452,"rank":4505021,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1675754,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6417983,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":200784,"mean":10.014496466334,"rank":128557,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":62807,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":200784,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":588,"mean":2.7091652470187,"rank":369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":194,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":588,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":1.9162222222222,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Ph.
