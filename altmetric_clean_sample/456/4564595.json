Although the combination of chemical inhibitors called 2i can establish mouse iPSCs without LIF from primed pluripotent stem cells, it has been difficult, if not impossible, to establish mouse iPSCs from differentiated somatic cells without LIF. We previously showed that the fusion gene of the transactivation domain of MyoD and the full-length Oct4 (M3O) increases the efficiency of making iPSCs when transduced into fibroblasts along with Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (M3O-SKM). Here, we report that M3O-SKM allows for establishment of iPSCs without exogenous LIF from mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The established iPSCs remained undifferentiated and maintained pluripotency over 90days without LIF as long as M3O was expressed. The iPSCs upregulated miR-205-5p, which was potentially involved in the LIF-independence by suppressing the two signaling pathways inhibited by 2i. The result indicates that potentiated Oct4 can substitute for the LIF signaling pathway, providing a novel model to link Oct4 and LIF, two of the most significant players in na\u00efve pluripotency.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6383cf058f610008a35","authors":["Hirai, Hiroyuki","Firpo, Meri","Kikyo, Nobuaki"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.scr.2015.09.002","endpage":"480","first_seen_on":"2015-09-29T10:11:39+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci","nigms"],"issns":["1876-7753","18735061"],"issue":"3","journal":"Stem Cell Research","last_mentioned_on":1443729784,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26413786?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26413786","pubdate":"2015-09-29T22:00:32+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"469","subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Establishment of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-independent iPS cells with potentiated Oct4.","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/establishment-leukemia-inhibitory-factor-lifindependent-ips-cells-potentiated-oct4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6420515,"mean":5.8843321179586,"rank":3025986,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1925064,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6420515,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201272,"mean":10.013462942997,"rank":108354,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":72607,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201272,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":362,"mean":3.1499889196676,"rank":174,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":362,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":3.8546315789474,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
