Statistical analyses were conducted using the Mann-Whitney test and Kruskal-Wallis test. Survival data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and log rank tests. Fisher's exact test was used to assess statistical significance at P\u00a0<\u00a00.05.\nA total of 79.5% of patients were identified as having mucocutaneous PV. The female\u00a0:\u00a0male gender ratio was 1.58; in severe PV, this increased to 2.8. The difference between the genders in age at onset was statistically significant (P\u00a0=\u00a00.05). Furthermore, multiple mucosal involvements in the oral cavity and at other sites were associated with severe mucocutaneous PV. Multiple relapses occurred more frequently in patients with severe PV than in those with mild PV (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001). The remission survival of females was longer than that of males (P\u00a0=\u00a00.003).\nPoor prognosis factors include the severe mucocutaneous type of PV, especially in female patients, and multiple mucosal involvements in the oral cavity and other mucosal sites. Female patients were younger than male patients and were more often observed to have severe mucocutaneous PV and to have a higher median period of remission survival than male patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b3e","authors":["Svecova, Danka"],"doi":"10.1111\/ijd.12644","endpage":"1144","first_seen_on":"2015-09-28T09:43:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1365-4632"],"issue":"10","journal":"International Journal of Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1443433419,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/ijd.12644"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ijd.12644\/pdf","pmid":"26394602","pubdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1138","subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Pemphigus vulgaris: a clinical study of 44 cases over a 20\u2010year period","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pemphigus-vulgaris-clinical-study-44-cases-20year-period"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6425095,"mean":5.9896225455997,"rank":4751605,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":949736,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6425095,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195206,"mean":10.151620655209,"rank":133141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":40539,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195206,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1127,"mean":2.8975896980462,"rank":838,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":133,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1127,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":3.3703076923077,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"BR":1,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/panoramaderm\/statuses\/648432877382860800","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4560525],"posted_on":"2015-09-28T09:43:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Panorama Dermatology","url":"http:\/\/www.panoramadermatologyclinic.co.za","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1824334637\/drjeanlouw__1__normal.jpg","description":"Dr. Jean Louw is a dermatologist in private practice at the Panorama Dermatology Clinic.","id_on_source":"panoramaderm","tweeter_id":"484636288","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":293},"tweet_id":"648432877382860800"}]}}
