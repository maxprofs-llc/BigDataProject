This research reported a new kind of self-healing polypeptide hydrogels based on self-assembly between cholesterol (Chol)-modified triblock poly(L-glutamic acid)-block-poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(L-glutamic acid) ((PLGA-b-PEG-b-PLGA)-g-Chol) and \u03b2-cyclodextrin (\u03b2-CD)-modified poly(L-glutamic acid) (PLGA-g-\u03b2-CD). The hydrogel formation relied on the host and guest linkage between \u03b2-CD and Chol. This study demonstrated the influences of polymer concentration and \u03b2-CD\/Chol molar ratio on viscoelastic behavior of the hydrogels. The results showed that storage modulus was highest at polymer concentration of 15% w\/v and \u03b2-CD\/Chol molar ratio of 1:1. The effect of the PLGA molecular weight in (PLGA-b-PEG-b-PLGA)-g-Chol on viscoelastic behavior, mechanical properties and in vitro degradation of the supramolecular hydrogels was also studied. The hydrogels showed outstanding self-healing capability and good cytocompatibility. The multilayer structure was constructed using hydrogels with self-healing ability. The developed hydrogels provide a fascinating glimpse for the applications in tissue engineering.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023e5","authors":["Li, Guifei","Wu, Jie","Wang, Bo","Yan, Shifeng","Zhang, Kunxi","Ding, Jianxun","Yin, Jingbo"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.biomac.5b01287","endpage":"3518","first_seen_on":"2015-09-29T11:50:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1526-4602","1525-7797"],"issue":"11","journal":"Biomacromolecules","last_mentioned_on":1473934237,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26414083?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26414083?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26414083","pubdate":"2015-09-29T22:00:28+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"startpage":"3508","subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Self-Healing Supramolecular Self-Assembled Hydrogels Based on Poly(L-glutamic acid).","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/selfhealing-supramolecular-selfassembled-hydrogels-based-polyl-glutamic-acid"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8386076,"mean":7.0651873001299,"rank":6364486,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1136779,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8386076,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239619,"mean":9.5850016526304,"rank":163863,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":41095,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239619,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1011,"mean":4.637500990099,"rank":615,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":244,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1011,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":6.4137931034483,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
