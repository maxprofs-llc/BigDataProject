The aim of the present study was to describe the clinical characteristics and to clarify the efficacy of EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in patients with NSCLC harboring minor mutations of the EGFR gene.\nThis was a multicenter, retrospective study that analyzed specimens from patients with NSCLC who had minor EGFR gene mutations and were treated with EGFR-TKIs between June 2002 and March 2012.\nOut of 56 patients with minor mutations of the EGFR gene, 44 were treated with either gefitinib or erlotinib. Mutation sites were G719X in exon 18 (n=35), L861Q in exon 21 (n=11), and G874S in exon 21 (n=1). Three patients had both the G719S and the L861Q mutation. The response rate to TKI treatment was 29.5%, and the disease control rate was 63.6%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 6.7 months [95% confidence interval (CI)=2.06-8.66 months]. The median PFS was 7.2 months (95% CI=4.23-12.3 months) in 32 patients who received first- or second-line treatment with EGFR-TKIs, whereas the median PFS was 1.57 months (95% CI=0.73-3.8 months) in 12 patients treated with EGFR-TKIs as a third-line or later treatment. In multivariate Cox analysis, erlotinib therapy was associated with a longer PFS than gefitinib (p=0.025).\nPatients with NSCLC harboring minor mutations of the EGFR gene exhibited a modest response to EGFR-TKI treatment. Treatment with first-generation EGFR-TKIs, in particular erlotinib, may be considered a first- or second-line option for patients with NSCLC with minor EGFR mutations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a66","authors":["Otsuka, Tomoyuki","Mori, Masahide","Yano, Yukihiro","Uchida, Junji","Nishino, Kazumi","Kaji, Reiko","Hata, Akito","Hattori, Yoshihiro","Urata, Yoshiko","Kaneda, Toshihiko","Tachihara, Motoko","Imamura, Fumio","Katakami, Nobuyuki","Negoro, Shunichi","Morita, Satoshi","Yokota, Soichiro"],"first_seen_on":"2015-09-29T04:17:22+00:00","issns":["1791-7530"],"issue":"7","journal":"Anticancer Research: International Journal of Cancer Research and Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1443500223,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26124334"],"pmid":"26124334","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Effectiveness of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in Japanese Patients with Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Harboring Minor Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutations: Results from a Multicenter Retrospective Study (HANSHIN Oncology Group 0212).","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effectiveness-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitors-japanese-patients-nonsmall-cell-lung-cancer-harboring-minor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6417267,"mean":5.8794758110387,"rank":3025877,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1923164,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6417267,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201260,"mean":10.008122310058,"rank":108305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":72652,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201260,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1569,"mean":2.9574923469388,"rank":555,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":792,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1569,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65,"mean":1.25390625,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
