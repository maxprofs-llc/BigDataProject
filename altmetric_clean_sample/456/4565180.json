X-ray crystallographic analyses reveal that are isomorphous and crystallize in the monoclinic space group C2\/c. In these dinuclear complexes, each Ln(\u0428) ion is eight-coordinated with two bidentate hfac and two \u03bc-phenol bridging L ligands. The TGA results show that the complexes have relatively high thermal stabilities. Complexes and show the characteristic transitions of the corresponding lanthanide ions with ligand-related emission peaks. Meanwhile, complexes and exhibit ligand-centered fluorescence at room temperature. Magnetic measurements were carried out on complexes . The magnetic study reveals that displays a magnetocaloric effect, with a maximum -\u0394Sm value of 16.89 J K(-1) kg(-1) at 2 K for \u0394H = 8 T. Dynamic magnetic studies reveal single-molecule magnet (SMM) behavior for complex . Fitting the dynamic magnetic data to the Arrhenius law gives an energy barrier \u0394E\/kB = 50.33 K and pre-exponential factor \u03c40 = 1.05 \u00d7 10(-8) s.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Hai-Yun Shen","Wen-Min Wang","Yan-Xia Bi","Hong-Ling Gao","Shuang Liu","Jian-Zhong Cui"],"doi":"10.1039\/c5dt02894a","endpage":"18901","first_seen_on":"2015-09-29T12:00:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1477-9234"],"issue":"43","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1443527494,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2015\/DT\/C5DT02894A?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=inorganicnews"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2015\/dt\/c5dt02894a","pmid":"26466301","pubdate":"2015-09-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"18893","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Luminescence, magnetocaloric effect and single-molecule magnet behavior in lanthanide complexes based on tridentate ligand derived from 8-hydroxyquinoline","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/luminescence-magnetocaloric-effect-singlemolecule-magnet-behavior-lanthanide-complexes-based-trident"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6417267,"mean":5.8794758110387,"rank":5467298,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6417267,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201259,"mean":10.008180981626,"rank":160407,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201259,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9740,"mean":0.64033370982647,"rank":2680,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9740,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":606,"mean":0.57404958677686,"rank":195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":606,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
