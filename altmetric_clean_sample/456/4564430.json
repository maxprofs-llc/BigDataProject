However, the resulting set of candidate molecules is usually very diverse pharmacologically, thus little insight on the shared mechanism of action (MoA) underlying their efficacy can be gained.\nWe introduce a computational method (Drug-Set Enrichment Analysis - DSEA) based on drug-induced gene expression profiles, which is able to identify the molecular pathways that are targeted by most of the drugs in the set. By diluting drug-specific effects unrelated to the phenotype of interest, DSEA is able to highlight phenotype-specific pathways, thus helping to formulate hypotheses on the MoA shared by the drugs in the set. We validated the method by analysing 5 different drug-sets related to well-known pharmacological classes. We then applied DSEA to identify the MoA shared by drugs known to be partially effective in rescuing mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene function in Cystic Fibrosis.\nThe method is implemented as an online web tool publicly available at http:\/\/dsea.tigem.it.\ndibernardo@tigem.itSupplementary Information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online and at http:\/\/dsea.tigem.it.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023d2","authors":["Francesco Napolitano","Francesco Sirci","Diego Carrella","Diego di Bernardo"],"doi":"10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btv536","first_seen_on":"2015-09-29T09:34:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1460-2059","1367-4811"],"journal":"Bioinformatics","last_mentioned_on":1452816000,"links":["http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/09\/28\/bioinformatics.btv536.short?rss=1","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26415724?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26415724","http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/10\/05\/bioinformatics.btv536.full","http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/10\/05\/bioinformatics.btv536.short?rss=1","http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/10\/05\/bioinformatics.btv536.long","http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/32\/2\/235.short?rss=1","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btv536"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/09\/28\/bioinformatics.btv536.full.pdf","pmid":"26415724","pubdate":"2015-09-30T10:22:20+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Mathematics","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["computationalbiology"],"title":"Drug-set enrichment analysis: a novel tool to investigate drug mode of action","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/drugset-enrichment-analysis-novel-tool-investigate-drug-mode-action-9"},"altmetric_score":{"score":14.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":14.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6975036,"mean":6.2337487846271,"rank":458211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":6516031,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6975036,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232027,"mean":9.2588824873075,"rank":23508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":208447,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232027,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5226,"mean":6.7266354066986,"rank":620,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":4599,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5226,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":182,"mean":13.479392265193,"rank":61,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":182,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":5,"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
