People with dementia felt insecure in their relatives' absence, and missed them. For the relatives, the patients' hospital stay was emotionally heavy. The relatives desired more emotional support from the nursing staff. The participating patients hoped that the nursing staff would spend more time discussing their cases with them. One of the factors that hindered good care of an older person with dementia was use of restraint. Relatives felt that use of restraints violated patients' dignity.\nTo improve the treatment of the people with dementia, the close relatives need to participate in planning the nature of care for the patients.\nThe results are applicable for efforts to improve the abilities of nursing staff, physicians and close relatives in the treatment of older people with dementia in acute care settings.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d01","authors":["Hynninen, Nina","Saarnio, Reetta","Isola, Arja","Nina Hynninen","Reetta Saarnio","Arja Isola"],"doi":"10.1111\/jocn.13004","endpage":"3699","first_seen_on":"2015-09-30T06:16:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1365-2702","09621067"],"issue":"23-24","journal":"Journal of Clinical Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1491388094,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/jocn.13004","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jocn.13004\/abstract","http:\/\/www.readcube.com\/articles\/10.1111%2Fjocn.13004","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/jocn.13004#.VuihNR6FB5s.twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jocn.13004\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jocn.13004\/pdf","pmid":"26419791","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"3691","subjects":["nursing"],"title":"Treatment of older people with dementia in surgical wards from the viewpoints of the patients and close relatives","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/treatment-older-people-dementia-surgical-wards-viewpoints-patients-close-relatives"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.7,"score_history":{"1y":1.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8461697,"mean":7.1088157534769,"rank":1980802,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6464642,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8461697,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239873,"mean":9.6018332193836,"rank":63780,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":175410,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239873,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2530,"mean":4.7080664294187,"rank":714,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":1809,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2530,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":8.5044444444444,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
