We then compared the outcome to ongoing surveillance. We used a modified prioritization method developed at the Robert Koch Institute in Germany. In a Delphi process experts scored pathogens according to ten variables. We ranked the pathogens according to the total score and divided them into four priority groups. We then compared the priority groups to self-reported time spent on surveillance by epidemiologists and ongoing programmes for surveillance through mandatory and\/or voluntary notifications and for surveillance of typing results. 106 pathogens were scored. The result of the prioritization process was similar to the outcome of the prioritization in Germany. Common pathogens such as calicivirus and Influenza virus as well as blood-borne pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and C virus, gastro-intestinal infections such as Campylobacter and Salmonella and vector-borne pathogens such as Borrelia were all in the highest priority group. 63% of time spent by epidemiologists on surveillance was spent on pathogens in the highest priority group and all pathogens in the highest priority group, except for Borrelia and varicella-zoster virus, were under surveillance through notifications. Ten pathogens in the highest priority group (Borrelia, calicivirus, Campylobacter, Echinococcus multilocularis, hepatitis C virus, HIV, respiratory syncytial virus, SARS- and MERS coronavirus, tick-borne encephalitis virus and varicella-zoster virus) did not have any surveillance of typing results. We will evaluate the possibilities of surveillance for the pathogens in the highest priority group where we currently do not have any ongoing surveillance and evaluate the need of surveillance for the pathogens from the low priority group where there is ongoing surveillance in order to focus our work on the pathogens with the highest relevance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Viktor Dahl","Anders Tegnell","Anders Wallensten"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0136353","first_seen_on":"2015-09-29T13:58:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"9","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1443950105,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0136353","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26397699"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0136353.PDF","pmid":"26397699","pubdate":"2015-09-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0136353","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Communicable Diseases Prioritized According to Their Public Health Relevance, Sweden, 2013.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/communicable-diseases-prioritized-according-public-health-relevance-sweden-2013"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6422619,"mean":5.8865586600353,"rank":1325197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":5087198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6422619,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201275,"mean":10.014815475422,"rank":56309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":144376,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201275,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97873,"mean":9.7210448953736,"rank":28045,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":69522,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97873,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5815,"mean":8.6603656690747,"rank":1575,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":4218,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5815,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":3,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
