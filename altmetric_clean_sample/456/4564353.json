Following detailed adjustment for tobacco smoking history, risk estimates for coffee drinking were not statistically significant; compared with never drinkers of coffee, the hazard ratios (95% CI) were 1.05 (0.85-1.30), 1.06 (0.86-1.31), 1.03 (0.85-1.25), 1.00 (0.79-1.25), and 1.24 (0.93-1.65) for <1, 1, 2-3, 4-5, and \u22656 cups per day, respectively (P-value for trend 0.46). The observed null association was consistent across all examined strata (sex, smoking status, coffee caffeination, and prevalent diabetes).\nIn a prospective study of coffee intake with the largest number of pancreatic cancer cases to date, we did not observe an association between total, caffeinated, or decaffeinated coffee intake and pancreatic cancer.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication 24 September 2015; doi:10.1038\/bjc.2015.235 www.bjcancer.com.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000243d","authors":["K A Guertin","N D Freedman","E Loftfield","R Z Stolzenberg-Solomon","B I Graubard","R Sinha"],"doi":"10.1038\/bjc.2015.235","first_seen_on":"2015-09-29T09:05:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-1827","0007-0920"],"journal":"British Journal of Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1453327690,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/bjc\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/bjc2015235a.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/bjc\/journal\/v113\/n7\/full\/bjc2015235a.html","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26402414","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26402414?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26402414","pubdate":"2015-09-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"A prospective study of coffee intake and pancreatic cancer: results from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prospective-study-coffee-intake-pancreatic-cancer-results-nihaarp-diet-health-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6997887,"mean":6.2543742573087,"rank":1332614,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":5655814,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6997887,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232195,"mean":9.2661290128082,"rank":54080,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":177790,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232195,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3432,"mean":8.6397668318275,"rank":1344,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":2084,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3432,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90,"mean":9.7183146067416,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
