The purpose of this meta-analysis was to compare leptin levels between the following groups: patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD vs controls; simple steatosis (SS) patients vs controls; non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) patients vs controls and NASH patients vs SS patients.\nWe performed a systematic search in PubMed, Scopus and the Cochrane Library. We analysed 33 studies, published between 1999 and 2014, including 2,612 individuals (775 controls and 1,837 NAFLD patients).\nHigher circulating leptin levels were observed in NAFLD patients vs controls (standardised mean difference [SMD] 0.640; 95% CI 0.422, 0.858), SS patients vs controls (SMD 0.358; 95% CI 0.043, 0.673), NASH patients vs controls (SMD 0.617; 95% CI 0.403, 0.832) and NASH patients vs SS patients (SMD 0.209; 95% CI 0.023, 0.395). These results remained essentially unchanged after excluding studies involving paediatric or adolescent populations and\/or individuals undergoing bariatric surgery. There was moderate-to-severe heterogeneity among studies in all comparisons, but no significant publication bias was detected. Meta-regression analysis demonstrated that BMI was inversely associated with leptin SMD and accounted for 26.5% (p\u2009=\u20090.014) and 32.7% (p\u2009=\u20090.021) of the between-study variance in the comparison between NASH patients and controls and NAFLD patients and controls, respectively. However, when bariatric studies were excluded, BMI did not significantly explain the between-study variance.\nCirculating leptin levels were higher in patients with NAFLD than in controls. Higher levels of circulating leptin were associated with increased severity of NAFLD, and the association remained significant after the exclusion of studies involving paediatric or adolescent populations and morbidly obese individuals subjected to bariatric surgery.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007106","authors":["Polyzos, Stergios A","Aronis, Konstantinos N","Kountouras, Jannis","Raptis, Dimitrios D","Vasiloglou, Maria F","Mantzoros, Christos S"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00125-015-3769-3","first_seen_on":"2015-09-28T12:41:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-0428"],"journal":"Diabetologia","last_mentioned_on":1452078002,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26407715","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00125-015-3769-3"],"pmid":"26407715","pubdate":"2015-09-28T22:01:18+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Physiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Metabolic Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Circulating leptin in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/circulating-leptin-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-systematic-review-metaanalysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.95,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6912770,"mean":6.208179930211,"rank":1418708,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":5486262,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6912770,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231242,"mean":9.2524014512997,"rank":57580,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":173230,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231242,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1848,"mean":14.31815701137,"rank":586,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":1260,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1848,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":24.473029411765,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
