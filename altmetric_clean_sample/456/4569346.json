Our patient presented with a large pleural effusion and right sided pleural studding, initially attributed to a new diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma. Rare atypical epithelial cells were also seen amongst the clonal population of lymphocytes. The patient lacked systemic manifestations of mantle cell lymphoma and did not improve with chemotherapy. A pleural biopsy ultimately revealed the presence of an undifferentiated carcinoma, favoring a lung primary. A discussion of synchronous pleural space malignancies involving lymphomas is given.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5323cf058f61000446e","authors":["Luke Masha","Andrey Zinchuk","Valia Boosalis"],"doi":"10.4081\/rt.2015.5929","first_seen_on":"2015-09-30T09:32:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2036-3613","2036-3605"],"issue":"3","journal":"Rare Tumors","last_mentioned_on":1443605543,"links":["http:\/\/www.pagepress.org\/journals\/index.php\/rt\/article\/view\/5929"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pagepress.org\/journals\/index.php\/rt\/article\/download\/5929\/4722","pmid":"26500732","pubdate":"2015-09-30T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Synchronous pulmonary malignancies: atypical presentation of mantle cell lymphoma masking a lung malignancy","type":"article","volume":"7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6419678,"mean":5.881345757739,"rank":3027135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1924082,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6419678,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201197,"mean":10.012128084057,"rank":108305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":72606,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201197,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113,"mean":1.4330357142857,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.05,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/GrupoGethi\/statuses\/649154815419883520","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4569346],"posted_on":"2015-09-30T09:32:23+00:00","author":{"name":"Grupo Gethi","url":"http:\/\/www.gethi.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2159246453\/Gethi2_normal.png","description":"twitter oficial del Grupo Espa\u00f1ol de Tumores Hu\u00e9rfanos e Infrecuentes","id_on_source":"GrupoGethi","tweeter_id":"561140455","geo":{"lt":40,"ln":-4,"country":"ES"},"followers":7911},"tweet_id":"649154815419883520"}]}}
