We show how to engineer strong photonic correlations in such a driven, dissipative system by quenching the kinetic energy through frustration. This produces an incompressible state of photons characterized by short-ranged crystalline order with period doubling. The latter manifests itself in strong spatial correlations, i.e., on-site and nearest-neighbor antibunching combined with extended density-wave oscillations at larger distances. We propose a state-of-the-art circuit QED realization of our system, which is tunable in\u00a0situ.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008519","authors":["Biondi, Matteo","van Nieuwenburg, Evert P L","Blatter, Gianni","Huber, Sebastian D","Schmidt, Sebastian"],"doi":"10.1103\/physrevlett.115.143601","first_seen_on":"2015-09-29T21:17:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1079-7114"],"issue":"14","journal":"Physical Review Letters","last_mentioned_on":1443561427,"links":["http:\/\/journals.aps.org\/prl\/abstract\/10.1103\/PhysRevLett.115.143601","http:\/\/journals.aps.org\/prl\/abstract\/10.1103\/PhysRevLett.115.143601?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26551811","pubdate":"2015-11-10T22:00:11+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Incompressible Polaritons in a Flat Band","type":"article","volume":"115","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/incompressible-polaritons-flat-band"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6417267,"mean":5.8794758110387,"rank":4504585,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1675400,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6417267,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201259,"mean":10.008178000378,"rank":128766,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":63053,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201259,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14330,"mean":9.9420450833973,"rank":9915,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":3919,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14330,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236,"mean":20.328553191489,"rank":158,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":62,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
