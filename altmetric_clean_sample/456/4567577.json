Under these conditions, zero-valent iron is consumed stoichiometrically and serves as both a formic acid decomposition site and a hydrogen transfer agent. However, the resulting iron(II) can be used to continuously regenerate iron(0) when a potential is applied to the glassy carbon working electrode. Controlled potential electrolysis experiments show a 17\u2009% conversion of cyclohexanone (over 1000\u2005seconds) to cyclohexanol with >80\u2009% efficiency of iron deposition from an iron(II) sulfate solution containing formic or sulfuric acid. In the absence of electrodeposited iron, formation of cyclohexanol could not be detected.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e64","authors":["Gottardo, Marina","Easton, Max","Fabos, Viktoria","Guo, Si\u2010Xuan","Zhang, Jie","Perosa, Alvise","Selva, Maurizio","Bond, Alan M.","Masters, Anthony.
