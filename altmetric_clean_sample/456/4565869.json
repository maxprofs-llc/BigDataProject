Each group consists of 21 patients. The patients in the control group are treated by the normal oral drugs, while those in the observation group are intervened by acupoint massage except the normal oral drug treatment provided for the control group. Respectively test the body fat percentage content, blood fat and blood pressure indicators of the selected patients in the two groups before treatment and after 12 weeks' treatment.\nafter 12 weeks' treatment, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and blood fat indicators of the patients in the control group are improved significantly compared with those before treatment, P < 0.05, but their percentage of body fat does not change significantly, P > 0.05; systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, blood fat and body fat percentage of the patients in the observation group are significantly improved compared with those before treatment and their improvement effect is better than that of the control group, P < 0.05. Moreover, the relapse rate of the patients in the observation group, who have been cured, is also obviously lower than that of the control group.\nas for the simple obesity patients who are complicated with hypertension, if they accept acupoint massage stimulation therapy, assisted with oral drugs for treatment, their curative effect is obviously superior to that of the single drug treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8203cf058f61000bc2a","authors":["Li Guo","Xin Fu","Zheng-Ming Jiang","Ai-Guo Xu"],"first_seen_on":"2015-09-29T13:53:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1940-5901"],"issue":"7","journal":"International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1442995788,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4565394\/"],"pmid":"26380011","pubdate":"2015-09-29T20:15:00+00:00","publisher":"e-Century Publishing Corporation","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"11727","title":"Acupoint massage nursing conducive to improve curative effect of the obesity patients who are complicated with hypertension and are treated by oral drugs","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/acupoint-massage-nursing-conducive-improve-curative-effect-obesity-patients-complicated-hypertension"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6393976,"mean":5.8557284631248,"rank":5447342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6393976,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201084,"mean":9.9812033637853,"rank":160207,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201084,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":947,"mean":1.3699133192389,"rank":475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":947,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":2.894,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
