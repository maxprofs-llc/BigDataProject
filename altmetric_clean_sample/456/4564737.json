The influence of hemorrhage-induced hypovolemia, and\/or subsequent fluid resuscitation, on the time until critical oxygen desaturation is not well described. We studied the time to oxygen desaturation in a pig model of hemorrhage shock and colloid resuscitation.\nAfter anesthetic induction with isoflurane, 9 swine (mean \u00b1 SD = 25.3 \u00b1 0.6 kg) were studied with the use of a stepwise hemorrhage and fluid resuscitation model with 4 sequential stages: 600 mL hemorrhage, 600 mL hydroxyethyl starch infusion, a further 600 mL hemorrhage, and a second 600 mL hydroxyethyl starch infusion. At each stage, after 5 minutes of mechanical ventilation with 100% oxygen, we induced apnea and measured the time to oxygen desaturation (oxygen saturation [SpO2] <70%). Hemodynamic and blood gas variables were recorded, and the cerebral and peripheral tissue oxygenation indices were recorded by near-infrared spectroscopy.\nThe times \u00b1 SD to SpO2 <70% at each stage were 136 \u00b1 41 (baseline), 147 \u00b1 41 (hemorrhage), 131 \u00b1 38 (resuscitation), 147 \u00b1 38 (repeat hemorrhage), and 134 \u00b1 36 seconds (repeat resuscitation). The mean differences in times before and after hemorrhage were 11.2 (6.5 to 16.0, P = 0.0052) and 16.0 (11.0 to 21.0, P < 0.0001), respectively. PaO2 before and after apneic desaturation (at SpO2 < 70%) was not different between stages. On the basis of tissue oxygenation index findings, hypovolemia decreased oxygen consumption, and fluid resuscitation recovered this parameter.\nIn patients with acute hemorrhagic shock, a hypovolemic state increases the duration of apnea until critical oxygen desaturation. Clinicians should thus consider the relationship between fluid resuscitation and time to desaturation when performing tracheal intubation in such patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f61000571e","authors":["Kurita, Tadayoshi","Morita, Koji","Sato, Shigehito"],"doi":"10.1213\/ane.0000000000000979","first_seen_on":"2015-09-29T10:30:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1526-7598"],"journal":"Anesthesia and analgesia","last_mentioned_on":1443522007,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26414602?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26414602","pubdate":"2015-09-29T22:00:18+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["anesthesiology"],"title":"The Influence of Hypovolemia and Fluid Resuscitation During Hemorrhagic Shock on Apneic Oxygen Desaturation After Preoxygenation in a Swine Model.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-hypovolemia-fluid-resuscitation-during-hemorrhagic-shock-apneic-oxygen-desaturation-after"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6417267,"mean":5.8794758110387,"rank":5467324,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6417267,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201259,"mean":10.00817402538,"rank":160410,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201259,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3164,"mean":4.0861157129308,"rank":2595,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3164,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":3.4989361702128,"rank":74,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Lecturer":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":7}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/statuses\/648804441693360128","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4564737],"posted_on":"2015-09-29T10:20:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":439},"tweet_id":"648804441693360128"}]}}
