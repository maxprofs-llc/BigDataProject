Based on initial exome sequencing of 21 melanomas, we report frequent somatic mutations in skin cancers in a bidirectional promoter of diphthamide biosynthesis 3 (DPH3) and oxidoreductase NAD-binding domain containing 1 (OXNAD1) genes. The UV-signature mutations occurred at sites adjacent and within a binding motif for E-twenty six\/ternary complex factors (Ets\/TCF), at -8 and -9 bp from DPH3 transcription start site. Follow up screening of 586 different skin lesions showed that the DPH3 promoter mutations were present in melanocytic nevi (2\/114; 2%), melanoma (30\/304; 10%), basal cell carcinoma of skin (BCC; 57\/137; 42%) and squamous cell carcinoma of skin (SCC; 12\/31; 39%). Reporter assays carried out in one melanoma cell line for DPH3 and OXNAD1 orientations showed statistically significant increased promoter activity due to -8\/-9CC > TT tandem mutations; although, no effect of the mutations on DPH3 and OXNAD1 transcription in tumors was observed. The results from this study show occurrence of frequent somatic non-coding mutations adjacent to a pre-existing binding site for Ets transcription factors within the directional promoter of DPH3 and OXNAD1 genes in three major skin cancers. The detected mutations displayed typical UV signature; however, the functionality of the mutations remains to be determined.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Denisova, Evgeniya","Heidenreich, Barbara","Nagore, Eduardo","Rachakonda, P Sivaramakrishna","Hosen, Ismail","Akrap, Ivana","Traves, V\u00edctor","Garc\u00eda-Casado, Zaida","L\u00f3pez-Guerrero, Jos\u00e9 Antonio","Requena, Celia","Sanmartin, Onofre","Serra-Guill\u00e9n, Carlos","Llombart, Beatriz","Guill\u00e9n, Carlos","Ferrando, Jose","Gimeno, Enrique","Nordheim, Alfred","Hemminki, Kari","Kumar, Rajiv"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.5771","first_seen_on":"2015-09-30T10:04:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"issue":"34","journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1443607474,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26416425?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4742151","pmid":"26416425","pubdate":"2015-09-30T22:00:53+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Frequent DPH3 promoter mutations in skin cancers.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.oncotarget.com\/abstract\/5771","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/frequent-idph3i-promoter-mutations-skin-cancers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6420402,"mean":5.8822202367126,"rank":3027498,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1924350,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6420402,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201202,"mean":10.012241668779,"rank":108304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":72616,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201202,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5820,"mean":1.8015074755113,"rank":1627,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":3605,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5820,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":923,"mean":1.3331127982646,"rank":280,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":538,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":923,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
