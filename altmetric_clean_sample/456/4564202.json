One of the methodological approaches to unravel c-di-GMP regulatory networks involves raising the c-di-GMP intracellular levels, e.g. by expressing a diguanylate cyclase (DGC), to provoke phenotypic changes.\nWe have constructed mini-Tn7 delivery vectors for the integration and stable expression of the pleD* gene encoding a highly active DGC, which can be used to artificially increase the intracellular levels of c-di-GMP in Gram negative bacteria. The functionality of these new vectors has been validated in several plant-interacting \u03b1- and \u03b3-proteobacteria. Similarly to vector plasmid-borne pleD*, the genome-borne mini-Tn7pleD* constructs provide significant increases in intracellular c-di-GMP, provoking expected phenotypic changes such as enhanced polysaccharide production, biofilm formation and reduced motility. However, the mini-Tn7pleD* constructs resulted far more stable in the absence of antibiotics than the plasmid-based pleD* constructs. Furthermore, we have also implemented an inducible system to modulate pleD* expression and intracellular c-di-GMP rises \"on demand\".\nmini-Tn7pleD* constructs are very stable and are maintained during bacterial free-living growth as well as during interaction with eukaryotic hosts, in the absence of selective pressure. This high stability ensures experimental homogeneity in time and space with regard to enhancing c-di-GMP intracellular levels in bacteria of interest.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007c8","authors":["Lorena Romero-Jim\u00e9nez","David Rodr\u00edguez-Carbonell","Mar\u00eda T Gallegos","Juan Sanju\u00e1n","Daniel P\u00e9rez-Mendoza"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12866-015-0521-6","first_seen_on":"2015-09-29T08:18:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-2180"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1452376504,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2180\/15\/190","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26415513?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/s12866-015-0521-6.pdf","pmid":"26415513","pubdate":"2015-09-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Microscopy","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Mycology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Parasitology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Virology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"190","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Mini-Tn7 vectors for stable expression of diguanylate cyclase PleD* in Gram-negative bacteria.","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/minitn7-vectors-stable-expression-diguanylate-cyclase-pled-gramnegative-bacteria"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6922153,"mean":6.2167633701173,"rank":1285623,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":5631171,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6922153,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231856,"mean":9.2486709538289,"rank":52478,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":179137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231856,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1231,"mean":2.9392341463415,"rank":182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":1046,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1231,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71,"mean":1.1611428571429,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":69,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
