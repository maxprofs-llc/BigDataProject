As with other immunosuppressive agents, risk of infection is a key clinical concern. This review summarises safety data from 15\u00a0years of experience of rituximab in autoimmune diseases with a particular focus on opportunistic infection and class-specific complications and infection risk. Rarely, cases of progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy in rituximab-treated patients (5\/100 000) have accumulated over time although no proven causal association has yet been shown. With repeat cycles of therapy, hypogammaglobulinaemia has been observed in a larger proportion of patients and is associated with increased risk of serious infections. The infection profile of the newer B cell-targeted agent, belimumab, in patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus is also discussed. Data from registries are needed to extend insights further and also to evaluate for any impact with the difference in mode of action of belimumab and infection risk in this population.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f61000708b","authors":["Md Yusof, MY","Vital, EM","Buch, MH"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11926-015-0539-7","first_seen_on":"2015-09-30T09:41:00+00:00","funders":["dohuk"],"issns":["1534-6307"],"issue":"10","journal":"Current Rheumatology Reports","last_mentioned_on":1443605991,"links":["http:\/\/eprints.whiterose.ac.uk\/90288\/?utm_campaign=wrro&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26290110","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Rheumatology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"B Cell Therapies, Approved and Emerging: a Review of Infectious Risk and Prevention During Use","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/b-cell-therapies-approved-emerging-review-infectious-risk-prevention-during"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6419678,"mean":5.881345757739,"rank":5469238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6419678,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201198,"mean":10.0120832915,"rank":160369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201198,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260,"mean":2.7425945945946,"rank":206,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":3.6036,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
