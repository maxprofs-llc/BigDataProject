Here we perform a genome-wide association study of PCOS in up to 5,184 self-reported cases of White European ancestry and 82,759 controls, with follow-up in a further \u223c2,000 clinically validated cases and \u223c100,000 controls. We identify six signals for PCOS at genome-wide statistical significance (P<5 \u00d7 10(-8)), in\/near genes ERBB4\/HER4, YAP1, THADA, FSHB, RAD50 and KRR1. Variants in\/near three of the four epidermal growth factor receptor genes (ERBB2\/HER2, ERBB3\/HER3 and ERBB4\/HER4) are associated with PCOS at or near genome-wide significance. Mendelian randomization analyses indicate causal roles in PCOS aetiology for higher BMI (P=2.5 \u00d7 10(-9)), higher insulin resistance (P=6 \u00d7 10(-4)) and lower serum sex hormone binding globulin concentrations (P=5 \u00d7 10(-4)). Furthermore, genetic susceptibility to later menopause is associated with higher PCOS risk (P=1.6 \u00d7 10(-8)) and PCOS-susceptibility alleles are associated with higher serum anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone concentrations in girls (P=8.9 \u00d7 10(-5)). This large-scale study implicates an aetiological role of the epidermal growth factor receptors, infers causal mechanisms relevant to clinical management and prevention, and suggests balancing selection mechanisms involved in PCOS risk.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Felix R.
