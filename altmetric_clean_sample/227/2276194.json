The genetic variants altering miRNA targets have been associated with many diseases. Here we systematically mapped the human genetic polymorphisms that may affect miRNA-mRNA interactions in the autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) pathway. We also mapped the polymorphic miRNA target sites in the genes that have been linked to AITDs or other thyroid-related diseases\/phenotypes in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). These genetic polymorphisms may potentially contribute to the pathogenesis of AITDs and other thyroid diseases. The polymorphic miRNA-mRNA interactions we mapped in the AITD pathway and the GWAS-informed thyroid disease loci may provide insights into the possible miRNA-mediated molecular mechanisms through which genetic variants assert their influences on thyroid diseases and phenotypes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51e3cf058f610003991","authors":[" Yan Cui","Yan Cui","Cui Y"],"doi":"10.3109\/08916934.2014.893575","first_seen_on":"2014-04-13T09:15:12+00:00","issns":["0891-6934","1607-842X"],"issue":"5","journal":"Autoimmunity","last_mentioned_on":1397380209,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/08916934.2014.893575","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/08916934.2014.893575","http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/08916934.2014.893575?ai=1lna&mi=3jqint&af=R"],"pmid":"24611733","pubdate":"2014-03-14T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"In silico mapping of polymorphic miRNA-mRNA interactions in autoimmune thyroid diseases.","type":"article","volume":"47","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/silico-mapping-polymorphic-mirnamrna-interactions-autoimmune-thyroid-diseases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3567985,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":138148,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107370,"mean":7.7415974257004,"rank":84485,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":782,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107370,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174,"mean":1.9759306358382,"rank":102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.60714285714286,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
