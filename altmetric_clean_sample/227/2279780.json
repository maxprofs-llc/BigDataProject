In this study, the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of Carassius auratus in Qihe River has been obtained with PCR. The gene composition and arrangement of mitochondrial genome sequence of this species are similar to most of other vertebrates', which contains 22 tRNA genes, 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNA genes, and a non-coding control region with total length of 16,580\u2009bp. Most of genes are encoded on Heavy-Strand (H-strand), exclude eight tRNA and ND6 genes, which are encoded on Light-Strand (L-strand). The bias of G and C has been found in different regions\/genes and different statistic results. The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of this species would contribute to better understand population genetics, conservation, and the evolution of natural triploid.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f610004220","authors":[" Chuanjiang Zhou","Zhou C","Li B","Ma L","Zhao Y","Kong X"],"doi":"10.3109\/19401736.2014.908367","first_seen_on":"2014-04-15T03:41:48+00:00","issns":["1940-1736","1940-1744"],"issue":"1","journal":"Mitochondrial DNA: The Journal of DNA Mapping, Sequencing & Analysis","last_mentioned_on":1397533253,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/19401736.2014.908367","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/19401736.2014.908367"],"pmid":"24730610","pubdate":"2014-04-13T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"The complete mitogenome of natural triploid Carassius auratus in Qihe River","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/complete-mitogenome-natural-triploid-icarassius-auratusi-qihe-river"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3661940,"mean":4.9429078425432,"rank":2928124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":71588,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3661940,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93515,"mean":6.9876014928246,"rank":74423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93515,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":950,"mean":0.62280505795574,"rank":255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":950,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":0.54861111111111,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IHC_CellBiology\/status\/455913624884609024","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2279780,2279780],"posted_on":"2014-04-15T03:40:53+00:00","author":{"name":"Cell Biology","url":"http:\/\/informahealthcare.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1253708030\/IHC-Twitter-profile-cell-biology2_normal.png","description":"Informa Healthcare's Cell Biology portfolio consists of 19 peer-reviewed journals designed to help you find the information you need for your research.","id_on_source":"IHC_CellBiology","tweeter_id":"140452905","geo":{"lt":"51.5072759","ln":"-0.1276597","country":"GB"},"followers":515},"tweet_id":"455913624884609024"}]}}
