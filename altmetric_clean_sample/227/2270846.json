Irrespective of the sources and amounts of dietary fat, total unsaturated fatty acids were 53-60% of phospholipid fatty acids in liver and plasma, and were 70-73% in heart. In all the animals either given or not given unsaturated fatty acid in diet, the sums of polyunsaturated fatty acids with more than three double bonds such as arachidonic acid, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and endogenous omega-9 eicosatrienoic acid were always 31-35, 18-20 and 30-38% in liver, plasma and heart, respectively. Dietary omega-3 unsaturated fatty acids and arachidonic acid appeared to be comparably incorporated into the phospholipids and substituted for each other in the phospholipids. These data may suggest that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids compete with arachidonic acid for the C-2 position of the phospholipids.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa67d3cf058f6100097fa","authors":["N Iritani","S Fujikawa","Iritani, N","Fujikawa, S"],"first_seen_on":"2014-04-10T17:14:10+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["0301-4800"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Nutritional Science & Vitaminology","last_mentioned_on":1414072800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7166709"],"pmid":"7166709","pubdate":"1982-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Competitive incorporation of dietary omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids into the tissue phospholipids in rats.","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/competitive-incorporation-dietary-omega3-omega6-polyunsaturated-fatty-acids-tissue-phospholipids-rat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":14.08,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":14.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3652877,"mean":4.9349660286616,"rank":196375,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":3456423,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3652877,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93639,"mean":7.0204421495547,"rank":7480,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":86157,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93639,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":198,"mean":2.883421319797,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":195,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":198,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":6.95,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
