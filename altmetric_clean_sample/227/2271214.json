This exciting concept allows the selective and quantitative imaging of contrast media by exploiting the K-edge discontinuity in the photo-electric component of X-ray absorption. An ideal application for K-edge imaging is CT imaging of target-specific and conventional contrast agents that have been designed to be spectral-CT-visible. Current limitations in detector hardware, however, result in typically high noise levels that hamper the application of K-edge imaging. In order to battle noise and assure sufficient sensitivity, the development of dedicated K-edge contrast media in combination with advanced image processing techniques is imperative. This work attempts a comprehensive overview on how the concert of dedicated contrast media, optimized data acquisition and innovative data processing techniques improve sensitivity of K-edge imaging which will foster clinical translation of the technology.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6133cf058f610006fec","authors":["Schirra CO","Brendel B","Anastasio MA","Roessl E"],"doi":"10.1002\/cmmi.1573","first_seen_on":"2014-04-10T20:06:36+00:00","issns":["1555-4309"],"issue":"1","journal":"Contrast Media and Molecular Imaging","last_mentioned_on":1397160377,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/24470295\/"],"pmid":"24470295","pubdate":"2014-01-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Spectral CT: a technology primer for contrast agent development.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/spectral-ct-technology-primer-contrast-agent-development"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3652877,"mean":4.9336525885283,"rank":2030865,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":945866,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3652877,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93631,"mean":7.018360568194,"rank":48646,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":24289,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93631,"percentile":25},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":1.3333333333333,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.9,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
