E-cigarettes that are marketed without a therapeutic claim by the product manufacturer are currently not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In many states, there are no restrictions on the sale of e-cigarettes to minors. Although e-cigarette use is increasing among U.S. adolescents and adults, its overall impact on public health remains unclear. One area of concern is the potential of e-cigarettes to cause acute nicotine toxicity. To assess the frequency of exposures to e-cigarettes and characterize the reported adverse health effects associated with e-cigarettes, CDC analyzed data on calls to U.S. poison centers (PCs) about human exposures to e-cigarettes (exposure calls) for the period September 2010 (when new, unique codes were added specifically for capturing e-cigarette calls) through February 2014. To provide a comparison to a conventional product with known toxicity, the number and characteristics of e-cigarette exposure calls were compared with those of conventional tobacco cigarette exposure calls.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5063cf058f6100030f9","authors":["Chatham-Stephens K","Law R","Taylor E","Melstrom P","Bunnell R","Wang B","Apelberg B","Schier JG"],"first_seen_on":"2014-04-11T23:19:37+00:00","issns":["0149-2195"],"issue":"13","journal":"MMWR: Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report","last_mentioned_on":1505351310,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24699766","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24699766"],"pmid":"24699766","pubdate":"2014-04-06T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Notes from the field: calls to poison centers for exposures to electronic cigarettes - United States, september 2010-february 2014.","type":"article","volume":"63","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/notes-field-calls-poison-centers-exposures-electronic-cigarettesunited-states-september-2010february"},"altmetric_score":{"score":14,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":3,"1m":3,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":14},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":622672,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7783936,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179385,"mean":7.5245701846321,"rank":15936,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":163230,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179385,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1460,"mean":61.77827827279,"rank":574,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":883,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1460,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":21.814,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
