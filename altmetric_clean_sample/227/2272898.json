Simultaneous Vision corrections, normally delivered in the form of contact or intraocular lenses, project on the patient's retina a focused image for near vision superimposed with a degraded image for far vision, or a focused image for far vision superimposed with the defocused image of the near scene. It is expected that patients with these corrections are able to adapt to the complex Simultaneous Vision retinal images, although the mechanisms or the extent to which this happens is not known. We studied the neural adaptation to simultaneous vision by studying changes in the Natural Perceived Focus and in the Perceptual Score of image quality in subjects after exposure to Simultaneous Vision. We show that Natural Perceived Focus shifts after a brief period of adaptation to a Simultaneous Vision blur, similar to adaptation to Pure Defocus. This shift strongly correlates with the magnitude and proportion of defocus in the adapting image. The magnitude of defocus affects perceived quality of Simultaneous Vision images, with 0.5 D defocus scored lowest and beyond 1.5 D scored \"sharp\". Adaptation to Simultaneous Vision shifts the Perceptual Score of these images towards higher rankings. Larger improvements occurred when testing simultaneous images with the same magnitude of defocus as the adapting images, indicating that wearing a particular bifocal correction improves the perception of images provided by that correction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Aiswaryah Radhakrishnan","Carlos Dorronsoro","Lucie Sawides","Susana Marcos"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0093089","first_seen_on":"2014-04-11T09:57:59+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"3","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1397210269,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0093089"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0093089.pdf","pmid":"24664087","pubdate":"2014-03-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e93089","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Short-Term Neural Adaptation to Simultaneous Bifocal Images","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/shortterm-neural-adaptation-simultaneous-bifocal-images"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3652877,"mean":4.9349660286616,"rank":2030992,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":945834,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3652877,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93392,"mean":6.9753651850821,"rank":48490,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":24245,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93392,"percentile":25},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64423,"mean":8.2780581487403,"rank":35761,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":19599,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64423,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3861,"mean":9.6403984455959,"rank":2358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":735,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3861,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
