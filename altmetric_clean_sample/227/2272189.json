Selective inhibitors of the mutated BRAF kinase produce response rates of approximately 50% with median progression-free survival of 6 - 7 months. BRAF-blocking therapies work rapidly, with responses seen within 2 weeks after therapy initiation, and they are associated with generally mild toxicities. The BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib recently was approved for use in patients with BRAF V600-mutated metastatic melanoma.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073c7","authors":[" Rodabe N   Amaria ","Rodabe N Amaria","Amaria RN","Kim KB","Kevin B Kim"],"doi":"10.1517\/14656566.2014.909410","endpage":"1050","first_seen_on":"2014-04-11T04:08:41+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1465-6566","1744-7666"],"issue":"7","journal":"Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1397603422,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1517\/14656566.2014.909410","http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/full\/10.1517\/14656566.2014.909410","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24720932","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1517\/14656566.2014.909410"],"pmid":"24720932","pubdate":"2014-04-09T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"1043","subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Dabrafenib for the treatment of melanoma.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1517\/14656566.2014.909410","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dabrafenib-treatment-melanoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.95,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4753549,"mean":5.7094135454232,"rank":1741101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3004705,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4753549,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113800,"mean":8.0934137734076,"rank":33930,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":79637,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113800,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":908,"mean":1.9192348401323,"rank":243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":664,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":908,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":1.3594594594595,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
