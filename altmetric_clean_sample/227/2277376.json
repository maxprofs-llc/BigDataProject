Peptide fragments formed by cleavage at arginine, lysine, glutamic acid, and methionine were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography and sequenced by manual Edman degradation. The complete primary structure of human adenine phosphoribosyltransferase was established by sequence analysis of 19 peptide fragments. Presumed homology between the human and rodent enzymes was used to order fragments that had inadequate overlapping sequences. The enzyme has 179 residues with a calculated subunit molecular weight of 19,481. Mass spectrometry indicated that the NH2-terminal residue is acetylated. Human adenine phosphoribosyltransferase has sequence homology with xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase from Escherichia coli in 110-amino acid region encompassing the NH2-terminal section of the enzyme.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["J M Wilson","T E O'Toole","P Argos","D S Shewach","P E Daddona","W N Kelley"],"first_seen_on":"2014-04-14T06:50:22+00:00","issns":["1083-351X","0021-9258"],"journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1397457853,"links":["http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/261\/29\/13677.full.pdf","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3531209"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/261\/29\/13677.full.pdf","pmid":"3531209","pubdate":"1986-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Human adenine phosphoribosyltransferase.
