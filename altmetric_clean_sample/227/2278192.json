Data from a large cross-national epidemiologic survey are used in this study to provide a principled basis for such a definition.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023d9","doi":"10.1016\/j.biopsych.2014.03.028","first_seen_on":"2014-04-14T15:06:05+00:00","issns":["0006-3223"],"journal":"Biological Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1397556878,"links":["http:\/\/www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com\/article\/S0006-3223(14)00241-8\/abstract?rss=yes?rss=yes","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com%2Farticle%2FS0006-3223%252814%252900241-8%2Fabstract%3Frss%3Dyes%3Frss%3Dyes&code=bps-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com\/article\/S0006322314002418\/pdf","pmid":"24842116","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["psychophysiology","psychiatry"],"title":"Sub-threshold Post Traumatic Stress Disorder in the WHO World Mental Health Surveys","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/subthreshold-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-world-health-organization-world-mental-health-surveys"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":2125578,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2238431,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107008,"mean":7.7971093292965,"rank":47855,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":55010,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107008,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2017,"mean":7.8088273809524,"rank":1229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":727,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2017,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":24.412285714286,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
