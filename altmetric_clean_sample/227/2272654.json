To disseminate MBIs with fidelity, care needs to be taken with the training and supervision of MBI teachers. A wealth of literature exists describing the process and practice of supervision in a range of clinical approaches, but, as of yet, little consideration has been given to how this can best be applied to the supervision of MBI teachers. This paper articulates a framework for supervision of MBI teachers. It was informed by the following: the experience of eight experienced mindfulness-based supervisors, the literature and understandings from MBIs, and by the authors' experience of training and supervision. It sets out the nature and distinctive features of mindfulness-based supervision (MBS), representing this complex, multilayered process through a series of circles that denote its essence, form, content and process. This paper aims to be a basis for further dialogue on MBS, providing a foundation to increase the availability of competent supervision so that MBIs can expand without compromising integrity and efficacy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081a8","authors":["Alison Evans","Rebecca Crane","Lucinda Cooper","Jody Mardula","Jenny Wilks","Christina Surawy","Maura Kenny","Willem Kuyken","Evans, Alison","Crane, Rebecca","Cooper, Lucinda","Mardula, Jody","Wilks, Jenny","Surawy, Christina","Kenny, Maura","Kuyken, Willem"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12671-014-0292-4","endpage":"581","first_seen_on":"2014-04-11T07:17:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1868-8535","1868-8527"],"issue":"3","journal":"Mindfulness","last_mentioned_on":1458058108,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s12671-014-0292-4","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s12671-014-0292-4\/fulltext.html","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26000064?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/alerts.springer.com\/re?l=D0In5vzxzI6hdm5e1I3d"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs12671-014-0292-4.pdf","pmid":"26000064","pubdate":"2014-03-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Child and School Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cognitive Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pediatrics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychology, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Social Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"}],"startpage":"572","title":"A Framework for Supervision for Mindfulness-Based Teachers: a Space for Embodied Mutual Inquiry.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/framework-supervision-mindfulnessbased-teachers-space-embodied-mutual-inquiry"},"altmetric_score":{"score":14.65,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":14.65},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7997669,"mean":6.7438428511856,"rank":539192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7458235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7997669,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176938,"mean":7.3193813617279,"rank":14741,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":162180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176938,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":557,"mean":7.1465215827338,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":520,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":557,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":2.8611111111111,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":13,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":13,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Student  > Ph.
