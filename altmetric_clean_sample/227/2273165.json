However, few studies have addressed the molecular mechanisms through which such important function is exerted. Fatty acid synthase (FASN), a key enzyme that synthesizes long-chain fatty acids and is involved in both embryogenesis and cancer, has been recently proposed as a direct target of p53 family members, including p63 and p73. Here we show that knockdown of either total or DeltaN-specific p63 isoforms in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC9) or immortalized prostate epithelial (iPrEC) cells caused a decrease in cell viability by inducing apoptosis without affecting the cell cycle. p63 silencing significantly reduced both the expression and the activity of FASN. Importantly, stable overexpression of either FASN or myristoylated AKT (myr-AKT) was able to partially rescue cells from cell death induced by p63 silencing. FASN induced AKT phosphorylation and a significant reduction in cell viability was observed when FASN-overexpressing SCC9 cells were treated with an AKT inhibitor after p63 knockdown, indicating that AKT plays a major role in FASN-mediated survival. Activated AKT did not cause any alteration in the FASN protein levels but induced its activity, suggesting that the rescue from apoptosis documented in the p63-silenced cells expressing myr-AKT cells may be partially mediated by FASN. Finally, we demonstrated that p63 and FASN expression are positively associated in clinical squamous cell carcinoma samples as well as in the developing prostate. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that FASN is a functionally relevant target of p63 and is required for mediating its pro-survival effects.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2009PLoSO...4.5877S","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Sabbisetti V","Di Napoli A","Seeley A","Amato AM","O'Regan E","Ghebremichael M","Loda M","Signoretti S"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0005877","first_seen_on":"2014-04-11T11:02:16+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"6","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1461053458,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0005877"],"pmid":"19517019","pubdate":"2009-11-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e5877","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"p63 Promotes Cell Survival through Fatty Acid Synthase","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/p63-promotes-cell-survival-through-fatty-acid-synthase-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7571218,"mean":6.5337981331095,"rank":3912317,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2120155,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7571218,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174532,"mean":7.2342034022611,"rank":82423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":71465,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174532,"percentile":40},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107917,"mean":10.211196708551,"rank":62203,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":34564,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107917,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4291,"mean":12.261487179487,"rank":2536,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":1223,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4291,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
