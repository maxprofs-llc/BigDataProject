Focusing on selected central nervous system (CNS) disorders (brain cancer, epilepsy, and anxiety) and using them as examples, we discuss the value of zebrafish models in translational neuroscience. We further evaluate the contribution of zebrafish to neuroimaging, circuit level, and drug discovery research. Outlining the role of zebrafish in modeling a wide range of human brain disorders, we also summarize recent applications and existing challenges in this field. Finally, we emphasize the potential of zebrafish models in behavioral phenomics and high-throughput genetic\/small molecule screening, which is critical for CNS drug discovery and identifying novel candidate genes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036b1","authors":["Stewart AM","Braubach O","Spitsbergen J","Gerlai R","Kalueff AV"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.tins.2014.02.011","first_seen_on":"2014-04-11T16:58:16+00:00","issns":["0166-2236","01662236"],"issue":"5","journal":"Trends in Neurosciences","last_mentioned_on":1467889769,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0166223614000277","http:\/\/www.cell.com\/trends\/neurosciences\/abstract\/S0166-2236%2814%2900027-7?utm_source=ECE001&utm_campaign=&utm_content=&utm_medium=email&bid=LMSC66F","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24726051"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S0166223614000277\/pdf","pmid":"24726051","pubdate":"2014-04-07T23:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Zebrafish models for translational neuroscience research: from tank to bedside.","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/zebrafish-models-translational-neuroscience-research-tank-bedside-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8019263,"mean":6.7829620361534,"rank":1711692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":6251085,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8019263,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177112,"mean":7.3560692672959,"rank":39769,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":136409,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177112,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1089,"mean":8.3504246323529,"rank":425,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":647,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1089,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":17.628,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":5,"Professor > Associate Professor":10,"Researcher":48,"Student  > Doctoral Student":14,"Student  > Ph.
