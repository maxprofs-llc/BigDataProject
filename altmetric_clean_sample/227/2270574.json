Acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype by a carcinoma cell is known as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The membrane-anchored matrix metalloproteinase-regulator RECK is abundant in normal mesenchymal cells. In aggressive carcinomas, however, RECK expression is often downregulated. This apparent paradox prompted us to clarify the relationship between EMT and RECK. We found that TGF\u03b2-induced E-cadherin downregulation, a hallmark of EMT, is accompanied by RECK-upregulation in a non-tumorigenic epithelial cell line (MCF10A). In contrast, the loss of E-cadherin expression is uncoupled from RECK-upregulation in carcinoma-derived cell lines (MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and A549). When RECK was artificially expressed in A549 cells, it showed little effect on EMT but elevated the level of integrin \u03b15 and attenuated cell proliferation and migration. These findings implicate RECK in the regulation of proliferation and migration of normal epithelial cells after EMT and suggest how the uncoupling between EMT and RECK-upregulation impacts on the fates and behaviors of carcinoma cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Kanako Yuki","Yoko Yoshida","Ryosaku Inagaki","Hiroshi Hiai","Makoto Noda"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep04568","first_seen_on":"2014-04-10T15:22:18+00:00","issns":["xxxx-xxxx","2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1397143270,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/srep04568"],"pmcid":"PMC3972504","pmid":"24691523","pubdate":"2014-04-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cell growth","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Cell migration","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Tumour suppressors","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"E-cadherin-downregulation and RECK-upregulation are coupled in the non-malignant epithelial cell line MCF10A but not in multiple carcinoma-derived cell lines","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep04568","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ecadherindownregulation-reckupregulation-coupled-nonmalignant-epithelial-cell-line-mcf10a-not-multip"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":3554150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":836165,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123781,"mean":8.0731126030056,"rank":82997,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":22800,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123781,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15808,"mean":13.310788384893,"rank":11673,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":2518,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15808,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":705,"mean":8.0533892045455,"rank":518,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":705,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
