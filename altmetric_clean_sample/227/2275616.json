They have a highly favourable risk profile compared to penetrating surgeries, and lower intraocular pressure with variable efficacy that may depend on the extent of outflow segments accessed. Since they are highly standardised procedures that use clear corneal incisions, they can elegantly be combined with cataract and refractive procedures to improve vision in the same session. There is a growing need for surgeons to become proficient in MIGS to address the increasing prevalence of glaucoma and cataracts in a well-informed, aging population. Techniques of visualisation and instrumentation in an anatomically highly confined space with semitransparent tissues are fundamentally different from other anterior segment surgeries, and present even experienced surgeons with a substantial learning curve. Here, we provide practical tips, and review techniques and outcomes of TM bypass and ablation MIGS.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000244f","authors":["Kevin Kaplowitz","Joel S Schuman","Nils A Loewen","Kaplowitz K","Schuman JS","Loewen NA"],"doi":"10.1136\/bjophthalmol-2013-304256","first_seen_on":"2014-04-12T18:37:03+00:00","issns":["1468-2079","0007-1161"],"issue":"5","journal":"British Journal of Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1397343221,"links":["http:\/\/bjo.bmj.com\/content\/98\/5\/579.short?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bjo.bmj.com\/content\/98\/5\/579.full.pdf","pmid":"24338085","pubdate":"2014-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"579","subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Techniques and outcomes of minimally invasive trabecular ablation and bypass surgery","type":"article","volume":"98","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/techniques-outcomes-minimallyinvasive-trabecular-ablation-bypass-surgery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":2940652,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1424512,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107290,"mean":7.775251666061,"rank":70436,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":33915,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107290,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1626,"mean":2.4672246153846,"rank":974,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":564,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1626,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":2.4727021276596,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Unspecified":2,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ruizoft\/status\/455051914707992576","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2275616],"posted_on":"2014-04-12T18:36:45+00:00","author":{"name":"Clara Ruiz","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/558901352613818368\/Wz9MvsD7_normal.jpeg","description":"Oftalm\u00f3loga Marina Baixa (Alicante) y Oftalmar (Alicante-Murcia) - Ophthalmologist - (Spain) http:\/\/es.linkedin.com\/in\/clararuizbelda\/","id_on_source":"ruizoft","tweeter_id":"435965366","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":628},"tweet_id":"455051914707992576"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/eyecenterllc\/status\/455116572085202944","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2275616],"posted_on":"2014-04-12T22:53:41+00:00","author":{"name":"Eye Center","url":"http:\/\/eyecenterllc.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/355341300\/apple-touch-icon_normal.png","description":"Ophthalmologists - Eye Physicians and Surgeons.
