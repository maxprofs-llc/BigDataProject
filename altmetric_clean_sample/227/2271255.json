However, a key reaction intermediate, the CO2-coordinated Re-bipyridyl complex, which should govern the activity of CO2 reduction in the photocatalytic cycle, has never been detected in a direct way. In this study on photoreduction of CO2 catalyzed by the 4,4'-dimethyl-2,2'-bipyridine (dmbpy) complex, [Re(dmbpy)(CO)3Cl] (1), we successfully detect the solvent-coordinated Re complex [Re(dmbpy)(CO)3DMF] (2) as the light-absorbing species to drive photoreduction of CO2. The key intermediate, the CO2-coordinated Re-bipyridyl complex, [Re(dmbpy)(CO)3(COOH)], is also successfully detected for the first time by means of cold-spray ionization spectrometry (CSI-MS). Mass spectra for a reaction mixture with isotopically labeled (13)CO2 provide clear evidence for the incorporation of CO2 into the Re-bipyridyl complex. It is revealed that the starting chloride complex 1 was rapidly transformed into the DMF-coordinated Re complex 2 through the initial cycle of photoreduction of CO2. The observed induction period in the time profile of the CSI-MS signals can well explain the subsequent formation of the CO2-coordinated intermediate from the solvent-coordinated Re-bipyridyl complex. An FTIR study of the reaction mixture in dimethyl sulfoxide clearly shows the appearance of a signal at 1682 cm(-1), which shifts to 1647 cm(-1) for the (13)CO2-labeled counterpart; this is assigned as the CO2-coordinated intermediate, Re(II)-COOH. Thus, a detailed understanding has now been obtained for the mechanism of the archetypical photochemical CO2 reduction sensitized by a Re-bipyridyl complex.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Youki Kou"],"doi":"10.1021\/ja500403e","first_seen_on":"2014-04-10T20:24:19+00:00","issns":["0002-7863"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1397610250,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ja500403e"],"pmid":"24689747","pubdate":"2014-04-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Direct Detection of Key Reaction Intermediates in Photochemical CO2 Reduction Sensitized by a Rhenium Bipyridine Complex.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/direct-detection-key-reaction-intermediates-photochemical-co-2-reduction-sensitized-rhenium-bipyridi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7530840,"mean":6.5078416564171,"rank":3671721,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3668879,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7530840,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174682,"mean":7.2571145802923,"rank":76022,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":92985,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174682,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18030,"mean":5.0261876975983,"rank":11609,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":5973,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18030,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":477,"mean":6.3372058823529,"rank":225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":477,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":17,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
