This study was conducted to assess the status of CHV1 infection in bitches in proestrus or estrus and to investigate possible risk factors by a detailed questionnaire. Blood samples were collected from healthy bitches (n = 193) not vaccinated against CHV1, aged one year or older and admitted for estrus control to the Canine Reproductive Clinical Unit, Norwegian School of Veterinary Science. The serum samples were analysed by immunoperoxidase monolayer assay and serum titers were recorded as the reciprocal value of the highest dilution producing specific cell staining.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008ad","doi":"10.1186\/1751-0147-56-19","first_seen_on":"2014-04-11T06:18:27+00:00","issns":["1751-0147"],"issue":"1","journal":"Acta Veterinaria Scandinavica","last_mentioned_on":1397197100,"links":["http:\/\/www.actavetscand.com\/content\/56\/1\/19\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.actavetscand.com\/content\/pdf\/1751-0147-56-19.pdf","pmid":"24694206","pubdate":"2014-04-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"startpage":"19","title":"A serological study of canine herpesvirus-1 infection in a population of breeding bitches in Norway","type":"article","volume":"56","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/serological-study-canine-herpesvirus1-infection-population-breeding-bitches-norway"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3567914,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":138145,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107029,"mean":7.8027319393058,"rank":84217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":781,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107029,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285,"mean":2.3000352112676,"rank":240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.975,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
