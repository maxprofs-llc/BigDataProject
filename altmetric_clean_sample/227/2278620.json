This leads to a problem of multi-dimensional multiple testing. For example, in gene expression studies over ordered categories (such as time-course or dose-response experiments), interest is often in testing differential expression across several categories for each gene. In this paper, we consider a framework for testing multiple sets of hypothesis, which can be applied to a wide range of problems.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007a9","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2105-15-108","first_seen_on":"2014-04-14T18:25:46+00:00","issns":["1471-2105"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","last_mentioned_on":1400487394,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2105\/15\/108\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2105-15-108.pdf","pmid":"24731138","pubdate":"2014-04-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Computer Science"],"startpage":"108","subjects":["computationalbiology"],"title":"A Two-Step Hierarchical Hypothesis Set Testing Framework, with Applications to Gene Expression Data on Ordered Categories","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/twostep-hierarchical-hypothesis-set-testing-framework-applications-gene-expression-data-ordered-cate"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036026,"mean":5.9656490211997,"rank":3550614,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":838545,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036026,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123515,"mean":7.9884933044031,"rank":82501,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":22953,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123515,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2893,"mean":4.9366666666667,"rank":2460,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":185,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2893,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117,"mean":5.7621896551724,"rank":96,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
