Players were observed on 6 occasions during the 2008-09 and 2009-10 seasons. Three following basketball-specific field tests were administered on each occasion: the shuttle sprint test for RSA, the vertical jump for lower body explosive strength (power), and the interval shuttle run test for interval endurance capacity. Height and weight were measured; body composition was estimated (percent fat, lean body mass). Multilevel modeling of RSA development curve was used with 32 players (16.0 \u00b1 1.7 years) who had 2 or more observations. The 16 players (16.1 \u00b1 1.8 years) measured on only 1 occasion were used as a control group to evaluate the appropriateness of the model. Age, lower body explosive strength, and interval endurance capacity significantly contributed to RSA (p \u2264 0.05). Repeated sprint ability improved with age from 14 to 17 years (p \u2264 0.05) and reached a plateau at 17-19 years. Predicted RSA did not significantly differ from measured RSA in the control group (p \u2265 0.05). The results suggest a potentially important role for the training of lower body explosive strength and interval endurance capacity in the development of RSA among youth basketball players. Age-specific reference values for RSA of youth players may assist basketball coaches in setting appropriate goals for individual players.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f6100040e2","authors":["Te Wierike SC","de Jong MC","Tromp EJ","Vuijk PJ","Lemmink KA","Malina RM","Elferink-Gemser MT","Visscher C"],"doi":"10.1097\/jsc.0000000000000223","first_seen_on":"2014-04-14T04:33:44+00:00","issns":["1064-8011"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research","last_mentioned_on":1399968000,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/Abstract\/2014\/04000\/Development_of_Repeated_Sprint_Ability_in_Talented.8.aspx","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24667248","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/Fulltext\/2014\/04000\/Development_of_Repeated_Sprint_Ability_in_Talented.8.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/2014\/04000\/Development_of_Repeated_Sprint_Ability_in_Talented.8.pdf","pmid":"24667248","pubdate":"2014-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"928","subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Development of Repeated Sprint Ability in Talented Youth Basketball Players","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-repeated-sprint-ability-talented-youth-basketball-players"},"altmetric_score":{"score":17.08,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":17.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6538717,"mean":6.066075403488,"rank":352618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":6189851,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6538717,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148712,"mean":7.7529845673826,"rank":11578,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":137132,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148712,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3343,"mean":16.07557989228,"rank":845,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":2500,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3343,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116,"mean":27.627217391304,"rank":54,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":62,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":10,"researcher":2,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":11,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
