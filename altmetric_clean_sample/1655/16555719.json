Although the production of grain legumes is in general lower than that of cereals, the nutritional value of grain legumes make them important components of food security. Nevertheless, limited by severe genetic bottlenecks during domestication and human selection, grain legumes, like other crops, have suffered from a loss of genetic diversity which is essential for providing genetic materials for crop improvement programs. Illustrated by whole-genome-sequencing, wild relatives of crops adapted to various environments were shown to maintain high genetic diversity. In this review, we focused on nine important grain legumes (soybean, peanut, pea, chickpea, common bean, lentil, cowpea, lupin, and pigeonpea) to discuss the potential uses of their wild relatives as genetic resources for crop breeding and improvement, and summarized the various genetic\/genomic approaches adopted for these purposes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e6e","authors":["Nacira Mu\u00f1oz","Ailin Liu","Leo Kan","Man-Wah Li","Hon-Ming Lam"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijms18020328","first_seen_on":"2017-02-20T10:56:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1422-0067"],"issue":"2","journal":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1487573820,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/18\/2\/328","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/ijms18020328"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/18\/2\/328\/pdf","pmid":"28165413","pubdate":"2017-02-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Potential Uses of Wild Germplasms of Grain Legumes for Crop Improvement","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/18\/2\/328","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/potential-uses-wild-germplasms-grain-legumes-crop-improvement"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.072,"score_history":{"1y":7.072,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.072},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8247986,"mean":6.9694821610306,"rank":1193347,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":7054050,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8247986,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242608,"mean":13.670356032596,"rank":55044,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":187545,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242608,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5275,"mean":2.3942923777019,"rank":354,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":4921,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5275,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":586,"mean":1.751411965812,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":553,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":586,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
