The effect of dopamine was blocked by pimozide (2.2 x 10(-8) M) but not by yohimbine (2.6 x 10(-10) M) or propranolol (1.0 x 10(-7) M), suggesting a specific prejunctional inhibitory effect. Higher concentrations of dopamine (1.4 x 10(-7) M to 1.4 x 10(-4) M) elicited concentration-dependent contractions which were blocked competitively with higher concentrations of pimozide (2.2 x 10(-7) M to 1.4 x 10(-4) M) and 2.2 x 10(-6) M), suggesting a postjunctional activity. ACh in very low concentrations (2.8 x 10(-11) M to 4.4 x 10(-10) M) blocked the field stimulated contractions. Atropine (2.6 x 10(-9) M) per se augmented them and also antagonized the inhibitory effects of ACh, suggesting a prejunctional activity of ACh. Higher concentrations of ACh (5.5 x 10(-7) M to 7.0 x 10(-5) M) produced contractions which were not altered by atropine in a concentration (2.6 x 10(-9) M) which antagonized the prejunctional activity of ACh. Histamine, in a wide range (3.1 x 10(-12) M to 2.6 x 10(-8) M), did not modify field stimulated contractions. Very low concentrations of 5-HT (1.2 x 10(-11) M to 3.8 x 10(-10) M) had an inhibitory effect on field stimulated contractions. Methysergide (2.8 x 10(-9) M) enhanced the responses to electrical stimulation and antagonized the 5-HT-induced inhibitory effect. Still higher concentrations of 5-HT (1.9 x 10(-6) M to 1.0 x 10(-3) M) produced concentration-dependent contractions. Methysergide (8.5 x 10(-7) M) failed to antagonize, whereas phentolamine (1.0 x 10(-6) M) antagonized 5-HT competitively. Dopamine (8.3 x 10(-10) M), ACh (4.4 x 10(-10) M) or 5-HT (3.9 x 10(-10) M), in concentrations which produced a maximal prejunctional inhibitory effect, did not alter the EC50 value of NA, ruling out a post-junctional effect. Moreover, the concentration ratios of these agents for EC50 pre to EC50 post were less than 1, suggesting their preferential prejunctional site of action. It is concluded that multiple prejunctional site of action. It is concluded that multiple prejunctional receptor activities for DA, ACh (muscarinic) and 5-HT, which modify the release of neurotransmitter, may be operative in this preparation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9153cf058f61000cee5","authors":["Rajani, A P","Gulati, O D"],"first_seen_on":"2017-02-20T08:34:48+00:00","issns":["0003-9780"],"journal":"Archives internationales de pharmacodynamie et de th\u00e9rapie","last_mentioned_on":1487579682,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3395178"],"pmid":"3395178","pubdate":"1988-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Evidence for multiple prejunctional receptor sites in rat isolated anococcygeus muscle.","type":"article","volume":"292"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8247986,"mean":6.9694821610306,"rank":2103175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5020972,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8247986,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242609,"mean":13.670334193431,"rank":86527,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":152092,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242609,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":3.3058260869565,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Om Dutt Gulati","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=766456877#altmetric_citation_8196645f-856c-4d30-9b5a-1671c89c1bc7","license":"public","citation_ids":[16553701],"posted_on":"2017-02-20T08:34:42+00:00","summary":"Om Dutt Gulati (1927\u20132012) was an Indian pharmacologist and the Dean of the Department of pharmacology at Baroda Medical College.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=53247209","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Tachs","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Tachs"}}]}}
