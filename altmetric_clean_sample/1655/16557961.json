Besides its beautiful flower, the leaf of tree peony has also good ornamental value owing to its leaf color change in spring. So far, the molecular mechanism of leaf color change in tree peony is unclear. In this study, the pigment level and transcriptome of three different color stages of tree peony leaf were analyzed. The purplish red leaf was rich in anthocyanin, while yellowish green leaf was rich in chlorophyll and carotenoid. Transcriptome analysis revealed that 4302 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were upregulated, and 4225 were downregulated in the purplish red leaf vs. yellowish green leaf. Among these DEGs, eight genes were predicted to participate in anthocyanin biosynthesis, eight genes were predicted involved in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, and 10 genes were predicted to participate in carotenoid metabolism. In addition, 27 MYBs, 20 bHLHs, 36 WD40 genes were also identified from DEGs. Anthocyanidin synthase (ANS) is the key gene that controls the anthocyanin level in tree peony leaf. Protochlorophyllide oxido-reductase (POR) is the key gene which regulated the chlorophyll content in tree peony leaf.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422e","authors":["Jianrang Luo","Qianqian Shi","Lixin Niu","Yanlong Zhang"],"doi":"10.3390\/molecules22020324","first_seen_on":"2017-02-20T13:36:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1420-3049"],"issue":"2","journal":"Molecules","last_mentioned_on":1487952026,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/22\/2\/324?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28230761","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/molecules22020324"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/22\/2\/324\/pdf","pmid":"28230761","pubdate":"2017-02-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Transcriptomic Analysis of Leaf in Tree Peony Reveals Differentially Expressed Pigments Genes","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/22\/2\/324","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transcriptomic-analysis-leaf-tree-peony-reveals-differentially-expressed-pigments-genes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8266357,"mean":6.977935429341,"rank":6271831,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1117297,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8266357,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243054,"mean":13.674678609192,"rank":177618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":40296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243054,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3873,"mean":2.1580666322314,"rank":2018,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1238,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3873,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":427,"mean":1.1405164319249,"rank":243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":143,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":427,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/P_Doggy_Bone\/statuses\/833671510401249280","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16557961],"posted_on":"2017-02-20T13:35:51+00:00","author":{"name":"Precious Daniel\u2122","url":"http:\/\/facebook.com\/precious.ogunleye","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/891043583511470080\/FfBKDjay_normal.jpg","description":"All I want is to be RICH and FAMOUS through God's blessings.
