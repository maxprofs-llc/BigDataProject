However, the experience with the use of these drugs in Indian renal transplant recipients is limited. We retrospectively reviewed our experience with DAA-based treatment for HCV infection in such patients. Between April 2015 and December 2016, six adults (median age 41 [range 34-52] years, male 5; GT1 2, GT3 3, and GT4 1; including three with prior failed interferon-based treatment) had received genotype-guided, DAA-based anti-HCV treatment 1 to 158 (median 15) months after renal transplantation. Of them, four completed the planned 24-week treatment without any significant adverse event. One of them had increase in serum creatinine after 16\u00a0weeks of treatment with sofosbuvir and daclatasvir, with acute interstitial nephritis on kidney biopsy; his renal function improved on stopping the drugs. The other patient had preexisting mild renal dysfunction, which worsened after 8\u00a0weeks of sofosbuvir-ledipasvir treatment; this did not reverse on stopping treatment. All the six patients achieved undetectable HCV RNA after 4\u00a0weeks of treatment and also achieved sustained virologic response, i.e. lack of detectable HCV RNA in serum 12\u00a0weeks after stopping treatment. Overall, DAA-based treatment was effective in treating HCV infection in our renal transplant recipients; however, caution and monitoring of renal function during such treatment is advisable in patients who have additional factors that predispose to renal injury.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f61000774f","authors":["Goel, Amit","Bhadauria, Dharmendra Singh","Kaul, Anupma","Prasad,
