Preclinical data showed that trastuzumab increases the susceptibility of tumor cells to lysis by vaccine-generated CD8+\u00a0T cells, suggesting potential benefit of a combination immunotherapy strategy. The current trial was undertaken to demonstrate the safety of this approach.\nThis study was designed as a dose-escalation trial enrolling clinically disease-free, human leukocyte antigen A2+\u00a0or A3+\u00a0, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer patients. Patients received 6-monthly inoculations of GP2+\u00a0granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) administered concurrently with standard-of-care trastuzumab. Local and systemic toxicity, as well as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were monitored. Immunologic responses were assessed in vivo by measuring the local reaction and in vitro using an interferon-\u03b3 enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assay.\nSeventeen disease-free breast cancer patients were vaccinated. There were no dose-limiting or grade 3-5 local or systemic toxicities, and the median LVEF was unchanged from baseline after vaccination. Mean local reaction at initial inoculation was 28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\u00a0mm, increasing to 68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08\u00a0mm at the final inoculation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Mean ELISPOT response to GP2 increased from 47\u00a0\u00b1\u00a019 at baseline to 144\u00a0\u00b1\u00a060 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.13) after vaccination. Based on safety and immunologic data, the appropriate dose was determined to be 1000\u00a0\u03bcg of GP2\u00a0+\u00a0250\u00a0\u03bcg of GM-CSF.\nThe GP2\u00a0+\u00a0GM-CSF vaccine is safe and stimulates an immunologic response when administered concurrently with trastuzumab. An ongoing phase II trial is evaluating the efficacy of combining a CD8 T-cell-eliciting vaccine with trastuzumab in HER2-positive breast cancer patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a31","authors":["G.
