Plasma samples were collected from two independent populations of diagnosed FH patients and matched normocholesterolemic controls (Study population 1, N=50; Study population 2, N=24) and a population of patients with suspected CAD (Study population 3, N=50). Extracellular vesicles were isolated and characterized using standard techniques. A panel of 30 miRNAs related to vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) (patho-)physiology was analyzed using RT-qPCR.\nAtherogenic lipoproteins significantly reduced levels of miR-15b-5p, -24-3p, -29b-3p, -130a-3p, -143-3p, -146a-3p, -222-3p, -663a levels (P<0.050) in microvesicles (0.1\u03bcm-1\u03bcm in diameter) released by CASMC. Two of these miRNAs, miR-24-3p and miR-130a-3p, were reduced in circulating microvesicles from FH patients compared with normocholesterolemic controls in a pilot study (Study population 1) and in different validation studies (Study populations 1 and 2) (P<0.050). Supporting these results, plasma levels of miR-24-3p and miR-130a-3p were also downregulated in FH patients compared to controls (P<0.050). In addition, plasma levels of miR-130a-3p were inversely associated with coronary atherosclerosis in a cohort of suspected CAD patients (Study population 3) (P<0.050).\nExposure to atherogenic lipoproteins modifies the miRNA profile of CASMC-derived microvesicles and these alterations are reflected in patients with FH. Circulating miR-130a-3p emerges as a potential biomarker for coronary atherosclerosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e5b","authors":["David de Gonzalo-Calvo","Ana Cenarro","Katia Garlaschelli","Fabio Pellegatta","David Vilades","Laura Nasarre","Sandra Camino-Lopez","Javier Crespo","Francesc Carreras","Rub\u00e9n Leta","Alberico Luigi Catapano","Giuseppe Danilo Norata","Fernando Civeira","Vicenta Llorente-Cortes"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.yjmcc.2017.03.005","first_seen_on":"2017-03-29T02:52:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00222828","1095-8584"],"journal":"Journal of Molecular & Cellular Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1490755926,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28342976?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28342976","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology","cardiology"],"title":"Translating the microRNA signature of microvesicles derived from human coronary artery smooth muscle cells in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and coronary artery disease","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0022282817300603","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/translating-microrna-signature-microvesicles-derived-human-coronary-artery-smooth-muscle-cells-patie-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8430317,"mean":7.0913096536278,"rank":7284393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8430317,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249022,"mean":13.237581159821,"rank":206095,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249022,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":755,"mean":2.2118275862069,"rank":551,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":755,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":2.6142857142857,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1,"Professor":3},"by_discipline":{"Materials Science":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":3,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"NL":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/microRNA_papers\/statuses\/846917855220154368","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18206533],"posted_on":"2017-03-29T02:52:06+00:00","author":{"name":"microRNApapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/509340649733517312\/5SbSeX5X_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for microRNA papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ.
