Most efforts have focused on VCT as the primary means of encouraging people to become aware of their HIV status. However, its uptake is low in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa including Ethiopia. Provider-initiated HIV testing and counseling provides a critical opportunity to diagnose HIV infection, to begin chronic care, and to prevent mother to child transmission. However, little is known about its acceptance and associated factors among pregnant women in the country and particularly in the present study area.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d8","authors":["Marelign Tilahun Malaju","Marelign Tilahun Malaju","Getu Degu Alene"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2458-12-226","first_seen_on":"2012-03-23T11:24:51+00:00","issns":["","1471-2458"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1334210419,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/12\/226\/abstract"],"pmid":"22440018","pubdate":"2012-03-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"226","subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Assessment of utilization of provider-initiated HIV testing and counseling as an intervention for prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV and associated factors among pregnant women in Gondar town, North West Ethiopia","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/assessment-utilization-providerinitiated-hiv-testing-counseling-intervention-prevention-mother-child-7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":3556473,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":833690,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78320,"mean":4.6868849193682,"rank":49078,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":14010,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78320,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5516,"mean":6.5565504986401,"rank":4700,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":369,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5516,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":206,"mean":4.4702243902439,"rank":177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":206,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":5,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
