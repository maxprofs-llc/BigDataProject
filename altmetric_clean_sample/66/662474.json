METHODS AND RESULTS: The fumonisin level in 118 frequently consumed corn-based products was determined and dietary habits were recorded using a 7-day weighed food record. Data were then compared to those obtained for a control group. The fumonisin intake in the celiac patients was significantly higher than in controls, with mean values (\u00b1 SE) of 0.395 \u00b1 0.049 and 0.029 \u00b1 0.006 \u03bcg\/kg body weight per day, respectively. With regard to nutritional habits, celiac patients showed a preference for a high fat diet, coupled with a high intake of sweets and soft drinks and a low intake of vegetables, iron, calcium and folate. CONCLUSION: These findings may have serious health implications for the celiac population due to the widespread occurrence of fumonisins in most of the widely consumed gluten-free products, leading to continuous exposure to this particular mycotoxin. Moreover, the recorded nutritional quality of the celiac patient's diet raises concerns regarding its long-term adequacy and its potential impact on chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008ec6","doi":"10.1002\/mnfr.1732","first_seen_on":"2012-03-23T09:52:52+00:00","issns":["1613-4133"],"journal":"Molecular Nutrition & Food Research","last_mentioned_on":1332915657,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22438341","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22438341?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22438341","pubdate":"2012-03-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Dietary exposure to fumonisins and evaluation of nutrient intake in a group of adult celiac patients on a gluten-free diet.","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":2121593,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2224169,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75863,"mean":4.4043917903561,"rank":28933,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":43964,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75863,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":781,"mean":4.6557948717949,"rank":395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":781,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.9863636363636,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/avoidiabetes\/status\/184663503804710914","citation_ids":[662474],"posted_on":"2012-03-27T15:29:44+00:00","author":{"name":"Rivkah Roth","url":"http:\/\/www.rivkahroth.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/533805668709302273\/Y0ZkWeS5_normal.jpeg","description":"Natural Medicine Professional, Author \/ Lecturer with special interest in Early Diabetes Risk Recognition and Avoidance, Celiac Disease, Fibromyalgia, etc.","id_on_source":"avoidiabetes","tweeter_id":"22938815","geo":{"lt":60.10867,"ln":-113.64258,"country":"CA"},"followers":503},"tweet_id":"184663503804710914"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/QuestAnswers\/status\/183128455989313536","citation_ids":[662474],"posted_on":"2012-03-23T09:50:00+00:00","author":{"name":"Paul Whiteley","url":"http:\/\/questioning-answers.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000344449848\/35f9d576889f4cf18b0bcf1f367afa4f_normal.jpeg","description":"Autism research, research blogging & tweeting & health science stuff.
