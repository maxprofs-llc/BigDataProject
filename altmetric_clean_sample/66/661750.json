In limited studies in human and murine models, pomegranate juice has been shown to exert significant antiatherogenic, antioxidant, antihypertensive, and anti-inflammatory effects. Pomegranate juice significantly reduced atherosclerotic lesion areas in immune-deficient mice and intima media thickness in cardiac patients on medications. It also decreased lipid peroxidation in patients with type 2 diabetes, and systolic blood pressure and serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity in hypertensive patients. Thus, the potential cardioprotective benefits of pomegranate juice deserve further clinical investigation, and evidence to date suggests it may be prudent to include this fruit juice in a heart-healthy diet.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003220","authors":["Basu A","Penugonda K"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1753-4887.2008.00133.x","first_seen_on":"2012-03-22T20:55:47+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"1","journal":"Nutrition Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1438621849,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/19146506\/?i=7&from=pomegranate%20and%20heart","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19146506"],"pmid":"19146506","pubdate":"2009-01-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Pomegranate juice: a heart-healthy fruit juice.","type":"article","volume":"67","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pomegranate-juice-hearthealthy-fruit-juice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12.99,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12.99},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8041560,"mean":6.832772947133,"rank":623570,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7418047,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8041560,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93671,"mean":5.1672445820433,"rank":6701,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":86970,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93671,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":999,"mean":13.565859719439,"rank":202,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":797,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":999,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":9.8487142857143,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":24,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Student  > Ph.
