The method examines a display framework based on the distances related to a scene. The distances of objects to the walker are measured using a size perspective method which uses only one camera without any occlusion effect. The method extracts the information of the closest object to the camera and transfers a sense of distance to a blind walker. The proposed image processing method can estimate the distances of objects within 7.5 m of the walker, and alert the presence of the closest object to the person. This new method offers the advantages of information reduction and scene understanding suitable for visual prosthesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002324","authors":["Mohammadi HM","Ghafar-Zadeh E","Sawan M","Mohammadi, Hossein Mahvash","Ghafar\u2010Zadeh, Ebrahim","Sawan, Mohamad"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1525-1594.2011.01421.x","endpage":"628","first_seen_on":"2012-03-22T18:50:24+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1525-1594","0160-564X"],"issue":"7","journal":"Artificial Organs","last_mentioned_on":1426593660,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1525-1594.2011.01421.x\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1525-1594.2011.01421.x\/pdf","pmid":"22428560","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Inc","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"616","title":"An Image Processing Approach for Blind Mobility Facilitated Through Visual Intracortical Stimulation","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/image-processing-approach-blind-mobility-facilitated-through-visual-intracortical-stimulation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6287062,"mean":5.9487733079114,"rank":710749,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":5572874,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6287062,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81716,"mean":4.8763818882702,"rank":9055,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":72640,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81716,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":202,"mean":1.4677611940299,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":202,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
