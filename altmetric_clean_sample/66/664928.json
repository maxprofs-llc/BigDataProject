We present a case of heart failure in a patient who presented to our facilities for heart transplant and a prior diagnosis of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy; further evaluation revealed a massive pelvic AVM as causative for the heart failure. This case emphasizes the importance of a thorough physical examination to guide appropriate diagnostic testing.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bb8","doi":"10.2459\/jcm.0b013e328351dba3","first_seen_on":"2012-03-25T16:42:58+00:00","issns":["1558-2027"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Cardiovascular Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1339191986,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jcardiovascularmedicine\/9000\/00000\/An_unusual_cause_of_heart_failure.99327.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jcardiovascularmedicine\/9000\/00000\/An_unusual_cause_of_heart_failure.99327.pdf","pmid":"22441217","pubdate":"2012-03-21T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"","subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"An unusual cause of heart failure","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/unusual-cause-heart-failure-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":3108545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":988462,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75453,"mean":4.400349096114,"rank":46840,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":18135,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75453,"percentile":24},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":825,"mean":0.96933252427184,"rank":441,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":73,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":825,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82,"mean":0.84567901234568,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/JCardioMedicine\/status\/211212615903494144","citation_ids":[664928],"posted_on":"2012-06-08T21:46:26+00:00","author":{"name":"J Cardio Medicine","url":"http:\/\/www.jcardiovascularmedicine.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1694904724\/JCM_cover_square_normal.jpg","description":"The Journal of Cardiovascular Medicine is a monthly publication of the Italian Federation of Cardiology.","id_on_source":"JCardioMedicine","tweeter_id":"437606168","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":347},"tweet_id":"211212615903494144"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/JCardioMedicine\/status\/183954183806922755","citation_ids":[664928],"posted_on":"2012-03-25T16:31:09+00:00","author":{"name":"J Cardio Medicine","url":"http:\/\/www.jcardiovascularmedicine.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1694904724\/JCM_cover_square_normal.jpg","description":"The Journal of Cardiovascular Medicine is a monthly publication of the Italian Federation of Cardiology.","id_on_source":"JCardioMedicine","tweeter_id":"437606168","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":347},"tweet_id":"183954183806922755"}]}}
