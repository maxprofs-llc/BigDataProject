To date, however, microfluidics has not yet been able to live up to these expectations. This fact has led to the recent development of new philosophies and methodologies for microfluidic diagnostics. In this Focus article, we will discuss some of the latest breakthroughs that could significantly impact medical diagnostics in the developing world.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037ac","authors":["Xiaole Mao","Tony Jun Huang"],"doi":"10.1039\/c2lc90022j","first_seen_on":"2012-03-23T14:13:57+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1473-0189","1473-0197"],"issue":"8","journal":"Lab on a Chip - Miniaturisation for Chemistry & Biology","last_mentioned_on":1334940800,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlelanding\/2012\/lc\/c2lc90022j","http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlelanding\/2012\/lc\/c2lc90022j\/unauth"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2012\/lc\/c2lc90022j","pmid":"22406768","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1412","subjects":["chemistry","biotechnology"],"title":"Microfluidic diagnostics for the developing world","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microfluidic-diagnostics-developing-world"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":1176094,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":3847730,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78291,"mean":4.6897437986971,"rank":16092,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":61966,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78291,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1820,"mean":3.9161462341946,"rank":336,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":1481,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1820,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":4.6815,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":29,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
