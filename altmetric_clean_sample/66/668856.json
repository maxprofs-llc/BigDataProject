Coating experiments were performed at which diprophylline tablets were coated with a sustained release formulation based on Kollicoat SR 30 D. Using PLS a multivariate model was constructed by correlating Raman spectral data with the mean dissolution time as determined by dissolution testing and the coating thickness as measured by terahertz pulsed imaging. By performing in-line measurements it was possible to monitor the progress of the coating process and to detect the end point of the process, where the acquired coating amount was achieved for the desired MDT or coating thickness.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000284d","authors":["Joshua M\u00fcller","Daniela Brock","Klaus Knop","J.
