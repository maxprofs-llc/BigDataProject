The degradation of acetochlor included the formation of several degradation products that were identified using GC\/ion-trap mass spectrometry with EI and CI and HPLC\/electrospray-QqTOF mass spectrometry. Thirteen ozonation products of acetochlor have been identified. Ozonation of the deuterated herbicide combined to MS(n) and high-resolution mass measurement allowed effective characterization of the degradation products. At the exception of one of them, the product B (2-chloro-2', ethyl-6', methyl-acetanilide), none of the identified degradation products has been already reported in the literature. Post-ozonation kinetics studies revealed that the concentrations of most degradation products evolved noticeably with time, particularly during the first hours following the ozonation treatment. This raises concerns about the fate of degradation products in the effluents of treatment plants and suggests the need for a better control on these products if their toxicity was demonstrated.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d3b","authors":["Bouchonnet, St\u00e9phane","Bourcier, Sophie","Souissi, Yasmine","Genty, Christophe","Sablier, Michel","Roche, Pascal","Boireau, V\u00e9ronique","Ingrand, Val\u00e9rie"],"doi":"10.1002\/jms.2056","first_seen_on":"2012-03-28T01:29:45+00:00","issns":["1076-5174","1096-9888"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Mass Spectrometry","last_mentioned_on":1332886714,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002%2Fjms.2056?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"22689619","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"GC-MSn and LC-MS\/MS couplings for the identification of degradation products resulting from the ozonation treatment of Acetochlor","type":"article","volume":"47","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gcmsn-lcmsms-couplings-identification-degradation-products-resulting-ozonation-treatment-acetochlor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036026,"mean":5.9656490211997,"rank":4197292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036026,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78381,"mean":4.7130529216636,"rank":63911,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78381,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":705,"mean":1.3502130681818,"rank":495,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":705,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":0.87,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
