Among these, the best evidence so far is in ITP and unexplained IDA, with high-quality studies showing the improvement of IDA and ITP after H. pylori eradication. The evidence of its association with coronary artery disease is weak and many of the results may be erroneous. The role of H. pylori infection in affecting serum leptin and ghrelin levels has attracted a lot of attention recently and available data to date have been conflicting. There have also been many uncontrolled, small sample studies suggesting an association between H. pylori infection and neurological disorders or chronic urticaria. However, more studies are required to clarify such proposed causal links.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d55","authors":["Huck-Joo TAN","Khean-Lee GOH"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1751-2980.2012.00599.x","endpage":"no","first_seen_on":"2012-03-28T01:32:44+00:00","issns":["17512972"],"journal":"Journal of Digestive Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1332845775,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111%2Fj.1751-2980.2012.00599.x"],"pmid":"22713083","pubdate":"2012-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"no","title":"Extragastrointestinal manifestations of Helicobacter pylori infection: Facts or myth?
