Increasing evidence suggests that this family of neurotrophic factors influence not only the survival and function of innervating motoneurons but also the development and differentiation of myoblasts and muscle fibers. Muscle contractions (e.g., exercise) produce BDNF mRNA and protein in skeletal muscle, and the BDNF seems to play a role in enhancing glucose metabolism and may act for myokine to improve various brain disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease and major depression). In adults with neuromuscular disorders, variations in neurotrophin expression are found, and the role of neurotrophins under such conditions is beginning to be elucidated. This paper provides a basis for a better understanding of the role of these factors under such pathological conditions and for treatment of human neuromuscular disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cd1","authors":["Yamaguchi, Akihiko"],"doi":"10.1155\/2011\/201696","first_seen_on":"2012-03-25T00:50:12+00:00","issns":["1110-7243"],"journal":"Journal of Biomedicine & Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1396791827,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/jbb\/2011\/201696\/","http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/bmri\/2011\/201696\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/jbb\/2011\/201696.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3179880","pmid":"21960735","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","biotechnology"],"title":"The Recent Understanding of the Neurotrophin's Role in Skeletal Muscle Adaptation","type":"article","volume":"2011","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/recent-understanding-neurotrophins-role-skeletal-muscle-adaptation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":3350318,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1481286,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77877,"mean":4.7107994247265,"rank":45292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":29120,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77877,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":353,"mean":3.6511420454545,"rank":216,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":353,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.9305333333333,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
