Mean resting metabolic rate of patients was significantly lower than that of controls (5162 +\/- 928 vs 5636 +\/- 449 kJ\/24 h [1229 +\/- 221 vs 1342 +\/- 107 kcal\/24 h]), as was mean fasting blood glucose level (4.0 +\/- 0.6 vs 4.6 +\/- 0.6 mmol\/L). Mean basal thyrotropin level was significantly lower in patients than controls, but other thyroid indexes did not differ. There were no group differences in body fat mass, fat cell size, or lipoprotein lipase activity. These data suggest that there is a disturbance in energy regulation in bulimia nervosa. However, the origins and role of this disturbance in the pathophysiology of bulimia are unclear.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fd3cf058f610006105","authors":["Devlin, M J","Walsh, B T","Kral, J G","Heymsfield, S B","Pi-Sunyer, F X","Dantzic, S"],"first_seen_on":"2012-03-28T01:29:06+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0003-990X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Archives of General Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1332861827,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2302026"],"pmid":"2302026","pubdate":"1990-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Metabolic abnormalities in bulimia nervosa.","type":"article","volume":"47","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metabolic-abnormalities-bulimia-nervosa-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628883,"mean":4.937418267118,"rank":2016405,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":938363,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628883,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73145,"mean":4.1064791097013,"rank":31385,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":27921,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73145,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1459,"mean":7.4271783264746,"rank":1017,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":271,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1459,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":9.5443076923077,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
