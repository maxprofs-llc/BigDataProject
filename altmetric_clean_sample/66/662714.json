The purpose of this prospective study was to determine the incidence of a postoperative leak, to propose a classification and to evaluate the results of conservative or surgical treatment. All patients submitted to gastric bypass either laparotomic or laparoscopic were included in a prospective protocol. In all radiological evaluation at 4(th) day after surgery was performed. The presence of a leak was evaluated according to the day of appearance, its location and its severity. Results of medical or surgical treatment were analyzed. From 1764 patients submitted to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, 60 had a postoperative leak (3.4%). This leak appeared early after surgery (before 4 days) in 20%. It was a localized subclinical leak in 20% and clinical - septic in 80%. There were 7 possible anatomic location of a leak, being the gastrojejunal anastomosis the most frequent location (53%) followed by gastric pouch. The highest mortality was associated to the jejuno-jejunal anastomosis. Conservative treatment was employed in near 65% of the patients: The mean time of closure of a leak was 34 days. The appearance of a postoperative leak is a major and serious complication. It can be classified according to the day of appearance, its severity and its location. Conservative or surgical treatment can be employed properly if these 3 parameters are carefully evaluated.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f610008357","doi":"10.1007\/s11695-011-0519-6","first_seen_on":"2012-03-23T12:18:08+00:00","issns":["1708-0428"],"journal":"Obesity Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1345544732,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22438218?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/content\/j6703q517v123g48\/?utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed"],"pmid":"22438218","pubdate":"2012-03-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["metabolism","generalsurgery"],"title":"Classification and Management of Leaks after Gastric Bypass for Patients with Morbid Obesity: A Prospective Study of 60 Patients.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/classification-management-leaks-after-gastric-bypass-patients-morbid-obesity-prospective-study-60-pa-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506051,"mean":5.113311188876,"rank":2980453,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1394033,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506051,"percentile":30},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75862,"mean":4.3687378231238,"rank":44924,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":28433,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75862,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1218,"mean":2.0334248151191,"rank":570,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":580,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1218,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":1.4375,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":12,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/cirugiaF\/status\/183165117842731008","citation_ids":[662714],"posted_on":"2012-03-23T12:15:41+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":439},"tweet_id":"183165117842731008"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/obesitynetwork\/status\/184052926065541120","citation_ids":[662714],"posted_on":"2012-03-25T23:03:31+00:00","author":{"name":"Obesity Network","url":"http:\/\/www.obesitynetwork.net","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3196974750\/2529f0aea793692d1e5b0883ead0f0af_normal.png","description":"Online resource for healthcare about obesity and its management.","id_on_source":"obesitynetwork","tweeter_id":"44465992","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":7644},"tweet_id":"184052926065541120"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/statuses\/237857966097833984","license":"public","citation_ids":[662714],"posted_on":"2012-08-21T10:25:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":439},"tweet_id":"237857966097833984"}]}}
