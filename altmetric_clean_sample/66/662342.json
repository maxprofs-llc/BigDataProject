This disease is often associated with preceding or successive lymphoproliferative malignancies, especially Mycosis Fungoides (MF) and Hodgkin's Disease (HD). Whether Granulomatous Slack Skin Disease is a benign disorder, an unusual host reaction or a precursor of malignant lymphoma or an indolent Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL) in itself, is still a controversy. This article reviews its literature on the etiology, clinical findings, and treatment of Granulomatous Slack Skin Disease. It also concentrates on its association with Hodgkin's disease and its comparison with Mycosis Fungoides and Sezary Syndrome.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f63","authors":["Shah, A.","Safaya, A."],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1468-3083.2012.04513.x","endpage":"1478","first_seen_on":"2012-03-23T07:14:21+00:00","issns":["1468-3083","0926-9959"],"issue":"12","journal":"Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology & Venereology","last_mentioned_on":1332486385,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/j.1468-3083.2012.04513.x"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1468-3083.2012.04513.x\/pdf","pmid":"22435618","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1472","subjects":["dermatology","sexuallytransmitteddiseases"],"title":"Granulomatous slack skin disease: a review, in comparison with mycosis fungoides","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/granulomatous-slack-skin-disease-review-comparison-mycosis-fungoides"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8204802,"mean":6.9465179116402,"rank":4358336,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2278622,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8204802,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93604,"mean":5.2567782442871,"rank":43860,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":36710,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93604,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1608,"mean":3.4823074051027,"rank":813,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":455,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1608,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":2.035,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
