Although LBP is a common problem among cyclists, studies investigating the causes of LBP during cycling are scarce and are mainly focussed on geometric bike-related variables. Until now no cycling field studies have investigated the relationship between maladaptive lumbar kinematics and LBP during cycling. Eight cyclists with NS-CLBP classified as having a 'Flexion Pattern' (FP) disorder and nine age- and gender-matched asymptomatic cyclists were tested. Subjects performed a 2 h outdoor cycling task on their personal race bike. Lower lumbar kinematics was measured with the BodyGuard\u2122 monitoring system. Pain intensity during and after cycling was measured using a numerical pain rating scale. The NS-CLBP (FP) subjects were significantly more flexed at the lower lumbar spine during cycling compared to healthy controls (p = 0.018), and reported a significant increase in pain over the 2 h of cycling (p < 0.001). One-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant main effect for group (p = 0.035, F = 5.546) which remained just significant when adding saddle angle as a covariate (p = 0.05, F = 4.747). The difference in posture between groups did not change over time. These findings suggest that a subgroup of cyclists with NS-CLBP (FP) demonstrate an underlying maladaptive motor control pattern resulting in greater lower lumbar flexion during cycling which is related to a significant increase in pain.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b0f","authors":["Dankaerts, Wim","Van Hoof W","Volkaerts K","O'Sullivan K","Verschueren S","Dankaerts W","Wannes Van Hoof","Koen Volkaerts","Kieran O'Sullivan","Sabine Verschueren","Wim Dankaerts"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.math.2012.02.012","endpage":"317","first_seen_on":"2012-03-22T15:52:45+00:00","issns":["1356-689X","1356689X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Manual Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1401186079,"links":["http:\/\/www.manualtherapyjournal.com\/article\/PIIS1356689X12000422\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22436688","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22436688?dopt=Citation","http:\/\/www.manualtherapyjournal.com\/article\/S1356-689X(12)00042-2\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.manualtherapyjournal.com\/article\/S1356-689X(12)00042-2\/pdf","pmid":"22436688","pubdate":"2012-03-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"312","subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine"],"title":"Comparing lower lumbar kinematics in cyclists with low back pain (flexion pattern) versus asymptomatic controls \u00e2\u0080\u0093 field study using a wireless posture monitoring system","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1356689X12000422","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparing-lower-lumbar-kinematics-cyclists-low-back-pain-flexion-pattern-versus-asymptomatic-control"},"altmetric_score":{"score":17.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":17.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7399542,"mean":6.4309289116677,"rank":398143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7000882,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7399542,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91072,"mean":4.9266615937016,"rank":4354,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":86711,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91072,"percentile":95},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1002,"mean":9.8862117882118,"rank":113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":889,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1002,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":5.562,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":18,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":18,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
