We report an analysis exploring relationships among baseline QOL assessments and candidate genetic variations in a large cohort of patients with lung cancer.\nQOL data were provided by 1,299 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer observed at the Mayo Clinic between 1997 and 2007. Overall QOL and subdomains were assessed by either Lung Cancer Symptom Scale or Linear Analog Self Assessment measures; scores were transformed to a scale of 0 to 10, with higher scores representing better status. Baseline QOL scores assessed within 1 year of diagnosis were dichotomized as clinically deficient (CD) or not. A total of 470 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 56 genes of three biologic pathways were assessed for association with QOL measures. Logistic regression with training\/validation samples was used to test the association of SNPs with CD QOL.\nSix SNPs on four genes were replicated using our split schemes. Three SNPs in the MGMT gene (adjusted analysis, rs3858300; unadjusted analysis, rs10741191 and rs3852507) from DNA repair pathway were associated with overall QOL. Two SNPs (rs2287396 [GSTZ1] and rs9524885 [ABCC4]) from glutathione metabolic pathway were associated with fatigue in unadjusted analysis. In adjusted analysis, two SNPs (rs2756109 [ABCC2] and rs9524885 [ABCC4]) from glutathione metabolic pathway were associated with pain.\nWe identified three SNPs in three glutathione metabolic pathway genes and three SNPs in two DNA repair pathway genes associated with QOL measures in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a18","authors":["Sloan, Jeff A","de Andrade, Mariza","Decker, Paul","Wampfler, Jason","Oswold, Curtis","Clark, Matthew","Yang, Ping","Jeff A.
