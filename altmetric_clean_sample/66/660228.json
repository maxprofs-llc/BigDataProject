Grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV) causes fanleaf degeneration disease, a major threat to grapevine production. Transgenic approaches exploiting the RNA silencing machinery have proven suitable for engineering viral resistance in several crop species. However, the artificial microRNA (amiRNA)-based strategy has not yet been reported in grapevine. We developed two amiRNA precursors (pre-amiRNAs) targeting the coat protein (CP) gene of GFLV and characterised their functionality in grapevine somatic embryos. To create these pre-amiRNAs, natural pre-miR319a of Arabidopsis thaliana was modified by overlapping PCR in order to replace miR319a with two amiRNAs targeting different regions of the CP gene: amiR(CP)-1 or amiR(CP)-2. Transient expression of these two pre-amiRNA constructs was tested in grapevine somatic embryos after co-cultivation with Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Expression of amiR(CP)-1 and amiR(CP)-2 was detected in plant tissues by an endpoint stem-loop RT-PCR as early as 1 day after a 48-h co-cultivation, indicating active processing of pre-amiRNAs by the plant machinery. In parallel, GUS-sensor constructs (G(CP)-1 and G(CP)-2) were obtained by fusing the target sequence of amiR(CP)-1 or amiR(CP)-2 to the 3' terminus of the GUS gene. Co-transformation assays with GUS-sensors and the pre-amiRNA constructs provided evidence for in vivo recognition and cleavage of the 21-nt target sequence of GUS-sensors by the corresponding amiRNA. This is the first report of amiRNA ectopic expression in grapevine. The constructs we developed could be useful for engineering GFLV-resistant grapes in the future.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f610006761","authors":["Jelly NS","Schellenbaum P","Walter B","Maillot P"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11248-012-9611-5","first_seen_on":"2012-03-22T03:09:49+00:00","issns":["0962-8819"],"issue":"","journal":"Transgenic Research","last_mentioned_on":1355675903,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22427113?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22427113","pubdate":"2012-03-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Transient expression of artificial microRNAs targeting Grapevine fanleaf virus and evidence for RNA silencing in grapevine somatic embryos.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transient-expression-artificial-micrornas-targeting-grapevine-fanleaf-virus-evidence-rna-silencing-g"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627536,"mean":4.9480380313392,"rank":2747902,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":721615,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627536,"percentile":19},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73069,"mean":4.0894942519297,"rank":47245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":20354,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73069,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180,"mean":4.1861675977654,"rank":125,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.09375,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Ph.
