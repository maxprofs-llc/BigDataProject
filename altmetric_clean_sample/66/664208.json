However, the dose-dependent neurodevelopmental consequences of linear stunting in this population have not previously been assessed. Understanding this relationship is important because organ growth and differentiation are more tightly linked to lean body mass and thus linear growth.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f61000317b","authors":["Sara E.
