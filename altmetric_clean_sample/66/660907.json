Though seroincidence is decreased, in the negative partner of HIV-discordant couples after joint testing and counseling in the Zambia Emory HIV Research Project (ZEHRP) cohort, the annual infection rate remains relatively high at 7-8%. Based on sequencing within the gp41 region of each partner's virus, 24% of new infections between 2004 and 2008 were the result of transmission from a non-spousal partner. Since these seroconvertors and their spouses have disparate epidemiologically-unlinked viruses, there is a risk of superinfection within the marriage. We have, therefore, investigated the incidence and viral origin of superinfection in these couples.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000893","authors":["Colleen S Kraft","Colleen S Kraft","Debby Basu","Paulina A Hawkins","Peter T Hraber","Elwyn Chomba","Joseph Mulenga","William Kilembe","Naw H Khu","Cynthia A Derdeyn","Susan A Allen","Olivier Manigart","Eric Hunter"],"doi":"10.1186\/1742-4690-9-22","first_seen_on":"2012-03-22T14:15:56+00:00","funders":["niaid"],"issns":["","1742-4690"],"issue":"1","journal":"Retrovirology","last_mentioned_on":1335986067,"links":["http:\/\/www.retrovirology.com\/content\/9\/1\/22\/abstract"],"pmid":"22433432","pubdate":"2012-03-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"22","title":"Timing and source of subtype-C HIV-1 superinfection in the newly infected partner of Zambian couples with disparate viruses","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/timing-source-subtypec-hiv1-superinfection-newly-infected-partner-zambian-couples-disparate-viruses"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":3557629,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":832525,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78315,"mean":4.6734687539903,"rank":49098,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":13963,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78315,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280,"mean":3.9464086021505,"rank":227,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":0.8975,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
