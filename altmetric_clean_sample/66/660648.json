Successfully implementing innovations in complex organisations, such as the UK's National Health Service (NHS), is often challenging as multiple contextual dynamics mediate the process. Research studies have explored the challenges of introducing innovations into healthcare settings and have contributed to a better understanding of why potentially useful innovations are not always implemented in practice, even if backed by strong evidence. Mediating factors include health policy and health system influences, organisational factors, and individual and professional attitudes, including decision makers' perceptions of innovation evidence. There has been limited research on how different forms of evidence are accessed and utilised by organisational decision makers during innovation adoption. We also know little about how diverse healthcare professionals (clinicians, administrators) make sense of evidence and how this collective sensemaking mediates the uptake of innovations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000834","doi":"10.1186\/1748-5908-7-22","first_seen_on":"2012-03-22T11:46:25+00:00","funders":["mrc","dohuk"],"issns":[],"issue":"1","journal":"Implementation Science","last_mentioned_on":1332416388,"links":["http:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/7\/1\/22\/abstract"],"pmid":"22436094","pubdate":"2012-03-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"22","title":"Making sense of evidence in management decisions: the role of research-based knowledge on innovation adoption and implementation in healthcare.
