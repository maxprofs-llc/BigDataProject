The role of physical activity consultations in such interventions is unclear. The purpose of this study was to assess the sustainability of pedometer-based interventions and empirically examine the role of physical activity consultations using long-term results of a community-based walking study.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d8","authors":["Fitzsimons CF","Baker G","Gray SR","Nimmo MA","Mutrie N","Claire F Fitzsimons","Graham Baker","Stuart R Gray","Myra A Nimmo","Nanette Mutrie","Fitzsimons, Claire F.","Baker, Graham","Gray, Stuart R.","Nimmo, Myra A.","Mutrie, Nanette"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2458-12-206","first_seen_on":"2012-03-24T12:40:15+00:00","issns":["","1471-2458"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1495493187,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/12\/206\/abstract","http:\/\/strathprints.strath.ac.uk\/38710\/"],"pmid":"22429600","pubdate":"2012-03-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"206","subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Does physical activity counselling enhance the effects of a pedometer-based intervention over the long-term: 12-month findings from the Walking for Wellbeing in the West study","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2458-12-206","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/physical-activity-counselling-enhance-effects-pedometerbased-intervention-longterm-12month-findings"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0.85,"6m":0.85,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8250529,"mean":6.9707556030289,"rank":3422267,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4783640,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8250529,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93733,"mean":5.2639017197969,"rank":31454,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":61796,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93733,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6967,"mean":9.0238888888889,"rank":3752,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":3132,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6967,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":210,"mean":5.8032344497608,"rank":102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":210,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":20,"Student  > Ph.
