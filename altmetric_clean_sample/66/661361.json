Men who have sex with men (MSM) are the group most affected by HIV in the UK and their sexual risk taking behaviour is reported to be increasing. One-to-one behavioural interventions, such as motivational interviewing (MI) have been recommended to reduce HIV in high risk groups. The Information, Motivation and Behavioral skills (IMB) model has been shown to provide a good basis for understanding and predicting HIV-relevant health behaviour and health behaviour change, however the IMB has yet to be applied to PEP after risky sexual exposure. The primary aim of this trial is to examine the impact of MI augmented with information provision and behavioural skills building (informed by the IMB Model), over and above usual care, on risky sexual behaviour in MSM prescribed PEP after potential sexual exposure. A secondary aim of this research is to examine the impact of the intervention on adherence to PEP. This study will also provide estimates of the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007bd","authors":["Carrie Llewellyn","Charles Abraham","Alec Miners","Helen Smith","Alex Pollard","Paul Benn","Martin Fisher","Llewellyn C","Abraham C","Miners A","Smith H","Pollard A","Benn P","Fisher M"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2334-12-70","first_seen_on":"2012-03-22T17:28:57+00:00","funders":["dohuk"],"issns":["","1471-2334"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1358808251,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2334\/12\/70\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3362782\/","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/1471-2334-12-70"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/1471-2334-12-70?site=bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"22440090","pubdate":"2012-03-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"70","subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Multicentre RCT and economic evaluation of a psychological intervention together with a leaflet to reduce risk behaviour amongst men who have sex with men (MSM) prescribed post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV following sexual exposure (PEPSE): A protocol","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2334-12-70","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multicentre-rct-economic-evaluation-psychological-intervention-together-leaflet-reduce-risk-behaviou"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4953684,"mean":5.8712951551441,"rank":2022020,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2906485,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4953684,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77737,"mean":4.6593667541422,"rank":23287,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":54138,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77737,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2640,"mean":3.1565782493369,"rank":928,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":1686,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2640,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":2.658875,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
