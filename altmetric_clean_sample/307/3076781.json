In this review, we have summarized the findings of previous investigations that have focused on anticancer or anti-inflammatory properties of NACOS and COS. Moreover, we have introduced recent evaluation of NACOS and COS as functional foods against cancer and inflammatory disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90e3cf058f61000cbfd","authors":["Kazuo Azuma"],"doi":"10.3390\/jfb6010033","first_seen_on":"2015-01-19T13:15:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2079-4983",""],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of functional biomaterials","last_mentioned_on":1446053695,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2079-4983\/6\/1\/33","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2079-4983\/6\/1\/33\/htm"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2079-4983\/6\/1\/33\/pdf","pmid":"25594943","pubdate":"2015-01-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","title":"Anticancer and Anti-Inflammatory Properties of Chitin and Chitosan Oligosaccharides","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/anticancer-antiinflammatory-properties-chitin-chitosan-oligosaccharides"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.95,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8305554,"mean":7.001193090928,"rank":1884340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":6411835,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8305554,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241220,"mean":8.1460902831037,"rank":59511,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":181316,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241220,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":1.4387671232877,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":69,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.19,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
