Here we describe in mice a form of long-term behavioral habituation to visual grating stimuli that is selective for stimulus orientation. Orientation-selective habituation (OSH) can be observed both in exploratory behavior in an open arena and in a stereotyped motor response to visual stimuli in head-restrained mice. We found that the latter behavioral response, termed a 'vidget', requires V1. Parallel electrophysiological recordings in V1 revealed that plasticity, in the form of stimulus-selective response potentiation (SRP), occurred in layer 4 of V1 as OSH developed. Local manipulations of V1 that prevented and reversed electrophysiological modifications likewise prevented and reversed memory demonstrated behaviorally. These findings suggest that a form of long-term visual recognition memory is stored via synaptic plasticity in primary sensory cortex.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f610003167","authors":["Sam F Cooke","Robert W Komorowski","Eitan S Kaplan","Jeffrey P Gavornik","Mark F Bear"],"doi":"10.1038\/nn.3920","endpage":"271","first_seen_on":"2015-01-19T21:23:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1097-6256","1546-1726"],"issue":"2","journal":"Nature Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1445627580,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/neuro\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/nn.3920.html","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/nn.3920","http:\/\/www.readcube.com\/articles\/10.1038\/nn.3920?shared_access_token=c3oem9YmxmcjDFgwq8kMPNRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0NOg2NECOOy7j_PzXhuy2_xn_3djj-7xiKKtDFQiGh9zy-bIJA54tPsagm8rQesvOvAxkvkKtxW8dsq7loSCBg3yL4ykh1lPFQQkGn7rL39Za2xB-X6uG3MFUwVb_xuMXR_azRhQ6BqAm6AlNNV-sSmuaJfiEpEZD0_Z1f7rb_TpA%3D%3D","http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/neuro\/rss\/aop\/~3\/pAFh_jfpNVo\/nn.3920","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/neuro\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/pdf\/nn.3920.pdf","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/neuro\/journal\/v18\/n2\/full\/nn.3920.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/nn.3920","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25599221?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25599221"],"pmid":"25599221","pubdate":"2015-01-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cortex","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Synaptic plasticity","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Visual system","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"262","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Visual recognition memory, manifested as long-term habituation, requires synaptic plasticity in V1","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/visual-recognition-memory-manifested-longterm-habituation-requires-synaptic-plasticity-v1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":85.374,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":85.374},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6391435,"mean":5.9810902648762,"rank":64841,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":6327306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6391435,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":203334,"mean":8.2826134173991,"rank":3414,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":199920,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":203334,"percentile":98},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3146,"mean":25.575714467409,"rank":230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":2916,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3146,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":52.736984126984,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":18,"researcher":3,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":18,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":65,"Student  > Doctoral Student":12,"Student  > Ph.
