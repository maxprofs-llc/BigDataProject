Parallel arrangement of AuNRs relative to the geometric confinement generated by selective removal of one block domain was achieved. Deposition of AuNRs with aspect ratios from 3.3 to 5.8 was accomplished and the alignment of the NRs within the channels was controlled primarily by capillary forces and the channel geometry. Ordered AuNR assembly in the BCP pattern can be achieved at high surface coverages, >30%, though the surface coverage depends on the aspect ratio of the NRs. Larger NRs align in the channels more readily, but pack at slightly lower densities.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003146","authors":["Lai F","Borca-Tasciuc T","Plawsky J"],"doi":"10.1088\/0957-4484\/26\/5\/055301","first_seen_on":"2015-01-17T08:31:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0957-4484"],"issue":"5","journal":"Nanotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1421150890,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25580876?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25580876","pubdate":"2015-01-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Controlling directed self-assembly of gold nanorods in patterned PS-b-PMMA thin films.","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/controlling-directed-selfassembly-gold-nanorods-patterned-psbpmma-thin-films"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4729227,"mean":5.5465942099605,"rank":3850185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":127771,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4729227,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159706,"mean":8.642155261263,"rank":127088,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":726,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159706,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1043,"mean":5.4504184261036,"rank":908,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1043,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":3.4739607843137,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
