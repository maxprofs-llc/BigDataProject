Histological images provide important tumor features unavailable in molecular profiling or omics data- the spatial context of tumor and stromal cells at single-cell resolution. Methods to map the spatial and morphological patterns of cancer and normal cells can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the highly heterogeneous tumor microenvironment. This review focuses on methods that help expand our knowledge of intra-tumoral spatial heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment and their potential synergies with molecular profiling technologies.Laboratory Investigation advance online publication, 19 January 2015; doi:10.1038\/labinvest.2014.155.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007fd6","authors":["Andreas Heindl","Sidra Nawaz","Yinyin Yuan"],"doi":"10.1038\/labinvest.2014.155","first_seen_on":"2015-01-19T21:54:51+00:00","funders":["niehs","wellcome"],"issns":["0023-6837","1530-0307"],"journal":"Laboratory Investigation","last_mentioned_on":1428082572,"links":["http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/labinvest\/rss\/aop\/~3\/JhMdz4G_EaY\/labinvest.2014.155","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/labinvest\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/labinvest2014155a.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/labinvest\/journal\/v95\/n4\/full\/labinvest2014155a.html?WT.ec_id=LABINVEST-201504"],"pmid":"25599534","pubdate":"2015-01-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cancer","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Cancer microenvironment","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Cancer imaging","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Tumour heterogeneity","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques","pathology"],"title":"Mapping spatial heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment: a new era for digital pathology","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mapping-spatial-heterogeneity-tumor-microenvironment-new-era-digital-pathology"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4953575,"mean":5.8708535421125,"rank":415331,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":4535170,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4953575,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174725,"mean":8.4761754653055,"rank":20195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":154391,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174725,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":561,"mean":4.9674107142857,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":515,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":561,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":9.2015151515152,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":20,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
