The long-term effects of antiretroviral use are still being discovered and have been associated with a number of comorbidities. Stigma presents challenges for those in need of services and health care, and can significantly affect mental health and treatment adherence. The training of elder service providers and health care providers in meeting the needs of HIV-positive older adults, including gay and transgender people, is needed as the population ages. HIV-related and antigay stigma should be challenged by social marketing campaigns. Continued research and key policy changes could greatly improve health outcomes for HIV-positive elderly persons by increasing access to treatment and support.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000221a","authors":["Sean Cahill","Cahill S","Valad\u00e9z R","Robert Valad\u00e9z"],"doi":"10.2105\/ajph.2012.301161","first_seen_on":"2015-01-20T00:42:46+00:00","issns":["0090-0036","1541-0048"],"issue":"3","journal":"American Journal of Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1488672792,"links":["http:\/\/ajph.aphapublications.org\/doi\/abs\/10.2105\/AJPH.2012.301161?journalCode=ajph","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3673522\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23327276","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.2105\/AJPH.2012.301161"],"pmid":"23327276","pubdate":"2013-01-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Growing Older With HIV\/AIDS: New Public Health Challenges.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/ajph.aphapublications.org\/doi\/10.2105\/AJPH.2012.301161","volume":"103","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/growing-older-hivaids-new-public-health-challenges"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.25,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8314034,"mean":7.0059620328577,"rank":1346040,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":6961876,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8314034,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241149,"mean":8.1625298903577,"rank":45835,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":195135,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241149,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8907,"mean":15.184249494723,"rank":2842,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":6042,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8907,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161,"mean":24.7236375,"rank":61,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":12,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Ph.
