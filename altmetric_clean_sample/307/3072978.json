To this end, a cellular transcriptional repressor, DR1, was identified from a genome-wide RNAi screen. Knockdown (KD) of DR1 resulted in reduction of the viral RNA and protein production, demonstrating that DR1 acts as a positive host factor in IAV replication. Genome-wide transcriptomic analysis showed that there was strong induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) expression after prolonged DR1 KD. We found that IFN\u03b2 was induced by DR1 KD, thereby activating the JAK-STAT pathway to turn on ISGs expression, which led to strong inhibition of IAV replication. This result suggests that DR1 in normal cells suppresses IFN induction probably to prevent undesired cytokine production, but this suppression could create a milieu that favors IAV replication once cells are infected. Furthermore, biochemical assays of the viral RNA replication showed that DR1 KD suppressed the viral RNA replication. We also showed that DR1 associated with all three subunits of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex, indicating that DR1 may be through interacting with individual components of the viral RdRp complex to enhance the viral RNA replication. Thus, DR1 could be considered a novel host susceptibility gene for IAV replication via dual mechanisms, which not only suppresses host defense to indirectly favor IAV replication but also directly facilitates the viral RNA replication.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f92","authors":["Shih-Feng Hsu","Wen-Chi Su","King-Song Jeng","Michael M C Lai"],"doi":"10.1128\/jvi.03610-14","first_seen_on":"2015-01-16T16:50:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1098-5514"],"journal":"Journal of Virology","last_mentioned_on":1432417536,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25589657?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25589657","pubdate":"2015-01-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"A host susceptibility gene, DR1, Facilitates Influenza A Virus Replication via Suppressing Host Innate Immunity and Enhancing Viral RNA Replication.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/journal-virology-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5133432,"mean":6.0721600422813,"rank":4269052,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5133432,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":183053,"mean":8.4423482507704,"rank":145727,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":183053,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5430,"mean":3.5286936820777,"rank":4663,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5430,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148,"mean":3.4120680272109,"rank":111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":26,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
