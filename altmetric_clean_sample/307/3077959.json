It was originally developed using data from the CaPSURE (Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor) registry. To calculate the score, which ranges from 0 to 10, 5 clinical variables are needed, ie prostate specific antigen, Gleason sum, clinical tumor grade, percentage of positive biopsies and patient age. To date, the only external validation of the CAPRA score has been conducted using the SEARCH (Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital) database. The present study uses a German database to contribute to existing validation work and to test transferability of the CAPRA score to a sample that differs fundamentally from the SEARCH sample in terms of clinical features.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f12","authors":["May M","Knoll N","Siegsmund M","Fahlenkamp D","Vogler H","Hoschke B","Gralla O"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.juro.2007.07.043","first_seen_on":"2015-01-19T20:12:21+00:00","issns":["0022-5347"],"issue":"5","journal":"The Journal of Urology","last_mentioned_on":1233041750,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.juro.2007.07.043","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17868719"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jurology.com\/article\/S002253470701779X\/pdf","pmid":"17868719","pubdate":"2007-01-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Validity of the CAPRA Score to Predict Biochemical Recurrence-Free Survival After Radical Prostatectomy.
