Understanding the mechanisms by which bupropion promotes smoking cessation may lead to more effective treatment. To the extent that reduced smoking reinforcement is one such mechanism, a longer duration of pre-quit bupropion treatment should promote extinction of smoking behavior. We evaluated whether four weeks of pre-quit bupropion (extended run-in) results in greater pre-quit reductions in smoking rate and cotinine and, secondarily, greater short-term abstinence, than standard one week of pre-quit bupropion (standard run-in). Methods. Adult smokers (n=95; 48 females) were randomized to a standard run-in group (n=48; 3 weeks placebo, then 1 week bupropion pre-quit) or an extended run-in group (4 weeks pre-quit bupropion; n=47). Both groups received group behavioral counseling and 7 weeks of post-quit bupropion. Smoking rate (and craving, withdrawal, and subjective effects) were collected daily during the pre-quit period; biochemical data (cotinine and CO) were collected at study visits. Results. During the pre-quit period, the extended run-in group exhibited a greater decrease in smoking rate, compared to the standard run-in group, interaction p=0.03. Cigarette craving and salivary cotinine followed a similar pattern, though the latter was evident only among women. Biochemically verified 4-week continuous abstinence rates were higher in the extended run-in group (53%) than the standard run-in group (31%), p=0.033.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50f3cf058f6100031e0","authors":["Hawk L.W.","Ashare R.L.","Rhodes J.D.","Oliver J.A.","Cummings K.M.","Mahoney M.C.","L W H Jr","R L A","J D R","J A O","K M C","M C M"],"doi":"10.1093\/ntr\/ntu347","endpage":"1384","first_seen_on":"2015-01-16T01:52:15+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1469-994X","1462-2203"],"issue":"11","journal":"Nicotine & Tobacco Research","last_mentioned_on":1446503558,"links":["http:\/\/ntr.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/01\/13\/ntr.ntu347.short?rss=1","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25589680?dopt=Citation","http:\/\/ntr.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/01\/13\/ntr.ntu347.short?rss=1&utm_content=buffere52ae&utm_medium=social&utm_source=plus.google.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/ntr\/ntu347","http:\/\/ntr.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/01\/13\/ntr.ntu347.full.pdf+html","http:\/\/ntr.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/01\/13\/ntr.ntu347.abstract","http:\/\/ntr.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/17\/11\/1377.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ntr.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/01\/13\/ntr.ntu347.full.pdf","pmid":"25589680","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Marketing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1377","subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Does Extended Pre Quit Bupropion Aid in Extinguishing Smoking Behavior?","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/extended-pre-quit-bupropion-aid-extinguishing-smoking-behavior"},"altmetric_score":{"score":17.65,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":17.65},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6520864,"mean":6.0390053006769,"rank":339092,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":6181420,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6520864,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207845,"mean":8.2847035757589,"rank":15616,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":192210,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207845,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1033,"mean":13.190093023256,"rank":111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":922,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1033,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":20.387894736842,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Scientists":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
