Ampakines Enhance Weak Endogenous Respiratory Drive (ATS Journals)"],"citation":{"abstract":"Rationale: Apnea of prematurity, which is prevalent amongst infants born at less than 34 weeks gestation, is treated with caffeine, theophylline or aminophylline. However, not all newborns respond adequately to, or tolerate, methylxanthine administration and thus alternative pharmacological therapies are required. Objectives: Rodent models are used to test the hypothesis that the ampakine CX1739, a positive allosteric modulator of amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate receptors, strengthens perinatal respiratory drive and reduces apneas. We also provide a systematic study of the effects of caffeine for comparison. Methods: Respiratory neural activity was recorded from brainstem-spinal cord in vitro perinatal rat preparations and minute ventilation was recorded in newborn rat pups using whole body plethysmography under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Measurements and Main Results: Using in vitro brainstem-spinal cord preparations, we found that CX1739 (10-100 \u03bcM) dose-dependently increases the frequency of respiratory activity generated by fetal and newborn rat preparations under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Plethysmographic recordings in vivo from postnatal day 0 rats demonstrated that CX1739 (40 \u03bcM) increases the frequency and regularity of ventilation, reduces apneas and protects against hypoxia-induced respiratory depression. Conclusions: The net effect of ampakine enhancement of respiratory drive in perinatal rodents is a marked increase in ventilation and the regularity of respiratory patterns in perinatal rat preparations. Importantly, from the perspective of clinical applications, CX1739 readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, is metabolically stable, and has passed through Phase I and II clinical trials in adults. Key words: apnea of prematurity, respiration, newborn, caffeine, breathing.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005716","authors":["Jun Ren","Xiuqing Ding","John J Greer"],"doi":"10.1164\/rccm.201410-1898oc","first_seen_on":"2015-01-17T14:11:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1535-4970"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory & Critical Care Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1427314531,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25594679?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.atsjournals.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1164\/rccm.201410-1898OC","http:\/\/www.atsjournals.org\/doi\/full\/10.1164\/rccm.201410-1898OC"],"pmid":"25594679","pubdate":"2015-01-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["criticalcare","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Ampakines Enhance Weak Endogenous Respiratory Drive and Alleviate Apnea in Perinatal Rats.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ampakines-enhance-weak-endogenous-respiratory-drive-alleviate-apnea-perinatal-rats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4921996,"mean":5.8458217409833,"rank":2267843,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2529453,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4921996,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175409,"mean":8.401770078902,"rank":74269,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":95509,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175409,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2691,"mean":6.0238743494424,"rank":1521,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":1083,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2691,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124,"mean":7.4021138211382,"rank":79,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":9,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"AT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hypoxiapapers\/status\/556405923594248193","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3076001],"posted_on":"2015-01-17T11:01:24+00:00","author":{"name":"Hypoxia Adaptation","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/491585034201989120\/716F2y0d_normal.png","description":"A feed for hypoxia related papers published in NCBI, ArXiv, bioArxiv, and PeerJ","id_on_source":"hypoxiapapers","tweeter_id":"2669362848","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":407},"tweet_id":"556405923594248193"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/pedsleep\/status\/577888071418580992","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3076001],"posted_on":"2015-03-17T17:43:47+00:00","author":{"name":"Rakesh Bhattacharjee","url":"http:\/\/www.rchsd.org\/doctors\/rakesh-bhattacharjee-md\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000156789568\/86a14590ed84f623fc7c280c653bbfbf_normal.jpeg","description":"Sleep Disorders in Children.
