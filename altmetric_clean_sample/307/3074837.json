Although CKD and ESRD are usually associated with adulthood, it is likely that the initial stages of CKD begin early in life. Many of these pathways are associated with low birth weight and disadvantaged socioeconomic status (SES) in childhood, translating childhood risk into later-life CKD and kidney failure. Social factors are thought to be fundamental causes of disease. Although the relationship between adult SES and CKD has been well established, the role of early childhood SES for CKD risk remains obscure. This review provides a rationale for examining the association between early-life SES and CKD. By collecting data on early-life SES and CKD, the interaction with other periods in the life course could also be studied, allowing for examination of whether SES trajectories (eg, poverty followed by affluence) or cumulative burden (eg, poverty at multiple time points) are more relevant to lifetime CKD risk.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f6100056cd","authors":["Brophy PD","Shoham DA"],"doi":"10.1053\/j.ackd.2014.06.006","first_seen_on":"2015-01-17T07:52:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["15485595"],"issue":"1","journal":"Advances in chronic kidney disease (Print)","last_mentioned_on":1442326919,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1548559514001013","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25573508"],"pmid":"25573508","pubdate":"2015-01-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nephrology"],"title":"Early-Life Course Socioeconomic Factors and Chronic Kidney Disease.","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/earlylife-course-socioeconomic-factors-chronic-kidney-disease-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6343916,"mean":5.8376241094019,"rank":2215167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4093229,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6343916,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194851,"mean":8.480564896074,"rank":66395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":126923,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194851,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172,"mean":2.750865497076,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":119,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":2.24952,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
