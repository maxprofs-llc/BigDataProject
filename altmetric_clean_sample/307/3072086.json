To investigate the mechanism of increased pathogenicity for H9N2 AIV PB2 627K, we analyzed the difference in mouse lung proteins expression response to PB2 K627E. By iTRAQ method, we found that the mutated K627E contributed to a set of differentially expressed lung proteins, including five upregulated proteins and nine downregulated proteins at 12 h post infection; ten upregulated proteins and twenty five downregulated proteins at 72 h post infection. These proteins were chiefly involved within the cytoskeleton and motor proteins, antiviral proteins, regulation of glucocorticoids signal-associated proteins, pro- and anti-inflammatory proteins. Alteration of moesin, FKBP4, Hsp70, ezrin and sp-A may play important roles in increasing virulence and decreasing lungs antiviral response. Further, three upregulated proteins (moesin, ezrin and sp-A) caused by PB2 K627E were also confirmed in A549 cells. Moreover, overexpression of sp-A in A549 inhibited virus replication and downregulation promoted virus replication. In this study, sp-A as a potential virulence determinant associated H9N2 AIV PB2 E627K mutation was identified using comparative proteomics. This article is protected by copyright.
