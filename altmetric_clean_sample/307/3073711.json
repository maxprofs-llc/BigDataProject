The same is true of addiction to videogames (Hellman, Schoenmakers, Nordstrom, & Van Holst 2013; Coulombe 2010); or to Facebook (Andreassen et al., 2012; Levard & Soulas, 2010). While certain researchers wished to see this condition included in the DSM-5 (Block, 2008), others question the operational and practical bases for the diagnostic criteria. Some see cyberaddiction as a problem linked more to time management, to brain deficits, to an impulse-control disorder or to psychosocial conditions while others consider it to be a pre-existing comorbidity. Considering that most addiction problems are generally understood more as individual and pathological problems rather than the result of psychosocial conditions (poverty, unemployment, weak social ties, social exclusion, hyper individualism, etc), the aim of this article is to propose a psychosocial perspective for this emerging trend in cyberaddictions. To what extent social conditions and cyberaddiction behaviors constitute a potential pathology? Can we include a psychosocial approach to gain a more general picture of this contemporary issue? In response to these questions, a contextualization and an attempt to define cyberaddiction will be followed by an analysis of some major issues in the development of this type of addiction. A demonstration of the cycle of addiction on how people develop addictions, including cyberaddictions, will be done within a psychosocial perspective in order to seize the multifactorial aspects of this addiction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002176","authors":["Suissa AJ"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.addbeh.2014.09.020","first_seen_on":"2015-01-16T23:16:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Addictive Behaviors","last_mentioned_on":1442997004,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25541291","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25541291?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25541291","pubdate":"2014-12-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Social Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Psychology"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences","substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"Cyber addictions: toward a psychosocial perspective.","type":"article","volume":"43C","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cyber-addictions-toward-psychosocial-perspective"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.176,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.176},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6381123,"mean":5.8517482508552,"rank":730648,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":5650504,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6381123,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195451,"mean":8.49254781274,"rank":30942,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":164506,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195451,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1390,"mean":5.1517724982001,"rank":163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":1227,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1390,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":3.3777307692308,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":11,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
