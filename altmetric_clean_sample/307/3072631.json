A reference dairy farm system representative of Wisconsin was compared with a system that produces dairy and bioenergy products. This integrated system investigates the effects at the farm level when the cow diet and manure management practices are varied. The diets evaluated were supplemented with varying amounts of dry distillers grains with solubles and soybean meal and were balanced with different types of forages. The manure-management scenarios included manure land application, which is the most common manure disposal method in Wisconsin, and manure anaerobic digestion (AD) to produce biogas. A partial life cycle assessment from cradle to farm gate was conducted, where the system boundaries were expanded to include the production of biofuels in the analysis and the environmental burdens between milk and bioenergy products were partitioned by system expansion. Milk was considered the primary product and the functional unit, with ethanol, biodiesel, and biogas considered co-products. The production of the co-products was scaled according to milk production to meet the dietary requirements of each selected dairy ration. Results indicated that land use was 1.6 m(2), NEI was 3.86 MJ, and GHG emissions were 1.02 kg of CO2-equivalents per kilogram of fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM) for the reference system. Within the integrated dairy and bioenergy system, diet scenarios that maximize dry distillers grains with solubles and implement AD had the largest reduction of GHG emissions and NEI, but the greatest increase in land use compared with the reference system. Average land use ranged from 1.68 to 2.01 m(2)\/kg of FPCM; NEI ranged from -5.62 to -0.73 MJ\/kg of FPCM; and GHG emissions ranged from 0.63 to 0.77 kg of CO2-equivalents\/kg of FPCM. The AD contributed 65% of the NEI and 77% of the GHG emission reductions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d4a","authors":["Aguirre-Villegas HA","Passos-Fonseca TH","Reinemann DJ","Armentano LE","Wattiaux MA","Cabrera VE","Norman JM","Larson R"],"doi":"10.3168\/jds.2014-8850","first_seen_on":"2015-01-16T14:11:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0022-0302"],"journal":"Journal of Dairy Science","last_mentioned_on":1436400440,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.journalofdairyscience.org%2Farticle%2FS0022-0302%252815%252900025-9%2Fabstract%3Frss%3Dyes&code=jods-site","http:\/\/www.journalofdairyscience.org\/article\/S0022-0302(15)00025-9\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.journalofdairyscience.org\/article\/S0022030215000259\/pdf","pmid":"25597974","pubdate":"2015-01-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Green cheese: Partial life cycle assessment of greenhouse gas emissions and energy intensity of integrated dairy production and bioenergy systems","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/green-cheese-partial-life-cycle-assessment-greenhouse-gas-emissions-energy-intensity-integrated-dair"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5328866,"mean":6.2435257016281,"rank":3530498,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1577154,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5328866,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186383,"mean":8.5226287838956,"rank":118040,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":59746,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186383,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2391,"mean":2.4346661087866,"rank":1753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":564,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2391,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":461,"mean":2.0007739130435,"rank":398,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":461,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
