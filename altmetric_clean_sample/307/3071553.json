Knocking out MALT1 leads to impaired NF-\u03baB signaling and failure to mount an effective immune response. However, it is unclear to which degree it is the scaffolding function versus the proteolytic activity of MALT1 that is essential. Previous work involving a MALT1 inhibitor with low selectivity suggests that the enzymatic function plays an important role in different cell lines. To help elucidate this proteolytic role of MALT1, we have designed activity-based probes that inhibit its proteolytic activity. The probes selectively label active enzyme and can be used to inhibit MALT1 and trace its activity profile, helping to create a better picture of the significance of the proteolytic function of MALT1.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024f0","authors":["Hachmann J","Edgington-Mitchell LE","Poreba M","Sanman LE","Drag M","Bogyo M","Salvesen GS"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.chembiol.2014.11.011","endpage":"147","first_seen_on":"2015-01-16T07:50:27+00:00","funders":["nci","nigms","niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["1074-5521","10745521"],"issue":"1","journal":"Chemistry & Biology","last_mentioned_on":1421020800,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.chembiol.2014.11.011"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S1074552114004190\/pdf","pmid":"25556944","pubdate":"2014-12-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"139","subjects":["chemistry","biology","biochemistry"],"title":"Probes to Monitor Activity of the Paracaspase MALT1","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/probes-monitor-activity-paracaspase-malt1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4720959,"mean":5.4442706765358,"rank":2426008,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1676967,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4720959,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159281,"mean":8.5948039176295,"rank":81608,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":58665,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159281,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":946,"mean":4.6494835978836,"rank":559,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":946,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":11.138,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
