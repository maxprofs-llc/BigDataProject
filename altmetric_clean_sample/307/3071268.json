Background Acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) pathology is reported to be present in up to 30% of all patients complaining of shoulder dysfunction. The operative approach to treating ACJ disease often includes a distal clavicle excision (DCE) and in circumstances of ACJ instability, reconstruction of the coracoclavicular ligament and\/or the acromioclavicular ligament. Surgical complica\u00actions for these procedures are rare, but potentially include suprascapular neuropathy secondary to the course of the suprascapular nerve posterior to the clavicle prior to entering the supraspinatus fossa. Diagnosis A 28-year-old Caucasian female reported directly to an outpatient physical therapy clinic with a complaint of right shoulder weakness. Three years prior, the patient underwent a DCE and coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction. A detailed examination, including diagnostic imaging, identified infraspinatus atrophy and weakness increasing the suspicion for suprascapular nerve injury. Electromyography was ordered to confirm the clinical and imaging diagnosis of suprascapular neuropathy and to rule out other nerve lesions, especially considering the selective atrophy of the infraspinatus muscle without mechanical explanation. Discussion The clinical decision making and systematic use of diagnostic testing resulted in identifying a rare case of suprascapular neuropathy, selective to the infraspinatus, in a patient who previously underwent a DCE and coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction. Without a spinoglenoid cyst or other suprascapular nerve lesion identified on advanced imaging, it is likely that the suprascapular neuropathy identified in this case was related to the surgical procedure. Timely differential diagnosis is important to help direct patient care and management. Level of Evidence Differential Diagnosis, level 4.
