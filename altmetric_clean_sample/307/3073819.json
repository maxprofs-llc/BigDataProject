This is a potentially serious illness, with lethality between 5 and 40% of cases. The most effective preventive vaccine is constituted by the attenuated virus strain 17D, developed in 1937. It is considered safe and effective, conferring protection in more than 90% in 10 years. Adverse effects are known as mild reactions (allergies, transaminases transient elevation, fever, headache) and severe (visceral and neurotropic disease related to vaccine). However, little is known about its potential to induce autoimmune responses. This systematic review aims to identify the occurrence of autoinflammatory diseases related to 17D vaccine administration. Six studies were identified describing 13 possible cases. The diseases were Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, multiple sclerosis, multiple points evanescent syndrome, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, autoimmune hepatitis, and Kawasaki disease. The data suggest that 17D vaccination may play a role in the mechanism of loss of self-tolerance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51e3cf058f610003990","authors":["Ana Cristina Vanderley Oliveira","Licia Maria Henrique da Mota","Leopoldo Luiz dos Santos-Neto","Joz\u00e9lio Freire De Carvalho","Iramaya Rodrigues Caldas","Olindo Assis Martins Filho","Pedro Luis Tauil"],"doi":"10.1155\/2014\/473170","first_seen_on":"2015-01-16T23:58:30+00:00","issns":["2090-0422"],"journal":"Autoimmune Diseases (2090-0422)","last_mentioned_on":1436729468,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4227414\/","http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/ad\/2014\/473170\/"],"pmid":"25405025","pubdate":"2015-01-16T20:14:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","title":"Occurrence of Autoimmune Diseases Related to the Vaccine against Yellow Fever","type":"article","volume":"2014","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/occurrence-autoimmune-diseases-related-vaccine-against-yellow-fever"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5342946,"mean":6.2520786839487,"rank":2465817,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2743182,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5342946,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186598,"mean":8.5229599511248,"rank":79098,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":101646,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186598,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102,"mean":3.8156831683168,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.3181818181818,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
