The activation of downstream signaling pathways led by IFN-\u03b2 promoter stimulator-1 (IPS-1), an adaptor, is known to culminate in the activation of IRFs and the expression of type I interferons. However, the role of Src-family-tyrosine kinases (STKs) in the RIG-I signaling pathway has not been fully evaluated. Through a combined approach of immunoprecipitation and micro reversed phase liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (RPLC-MS\/MS) analysis, we established that Lyn, one of the STKs, is associated with RIG-I in macrophages. The association of Lyn and RIG-I was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation study with 293T cells overexpressing Lyn and RIG-I. Suppression of Lyn by siRNA knockdown or a pharmacological inhibitor (PP2) resulted in the attenuation of IRF3 activation and IFN-\u03b2 expression induced by short poly I:C, a RIG-I agonist, in macrophages. Lyn activation, as determined by phosphorylation of Tyr396 residue, was observed upon short poly I:C stimulation in the mitochondria of macrophages. Short poly I:C induced the formation of speckle-like aggregates of Lyn, which are prominent in mitochondria. Lyn associated with IPS-1, an adaptor protein of RIG-I, which resides on mitochondria membrane. Helicase domain of RIG-I and CARD of IPS-1 are responsible for the interaction with Lyn while SH3 and SH2 domains in Lyn are required for the association with RIG-I and IPS-1. Collectively, our results indicate that Lyn plays a positive regulatory role in RIG-I-mediated interferon expression as a downstream component of IPS-1. They provide further information as to how tyrosine kinases such as STKs play a role in the regulation of antiviral immunity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c4","authors":["Young Ju Lim","Jung Eun Koo","Eun-Hee Hong","Zee-Yong Park","Kyung-Min Lim","Ok-Nam Bae","Joo Young Lee"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cyto.2014.12.008","first_seen_on":"2015-01-16T01:50:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1096-0023"],"issue":"1","journal":"Cytokine","last_mentioned_on":1421372952,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25585356?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25585356","pubdate":"2015-01-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"A Src-family-tyrosine kinase, Lyn, is required for efficient IFN-\u03b2 expression in pattern recognition receptor, RIG-I, signal pathway by interacting with IPS-1.","type":"article","volume":"72","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/srcfamilytyrosine-kinase-lyn-required-efficient-ifn-expression-pattern-recognition-receptor-rigi-sig"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4742359,"mean":5.4864603665373,"rank":3864504,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":122907,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4742359,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160192,"mean":8.6122790793491,"rank":127370,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":630,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160192,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":634,"mean":1.6634439178515,"rank":426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":634,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":2.0122142857143,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
