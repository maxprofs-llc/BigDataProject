Humans with SDB are prone to develop hypertension. Studies on rodents established that exposure to chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) alone is sufficient to induce hypertension similar to that seen in patients with SDB. Available evidence from studies on experimental animals suggests that catecholamines secreted from adrenal medulla (AM), an end-organ of the sympathetic nervous system is a major contributor to CIH-induced hypertension. In this article, we present an overview of our current understanding on how CIH reconfigures AM function and highlight recent findings on the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003472","authors":["Ganesh K Kumar","Jayasri Nanduri","Ying-Jie Peng","Nanduri R Prabhakar"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.resp.2015.01.001","first_seen_on":"2015-01-16T04:29:33+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["1878-1519"],"journal":"Respiratory Physiology & Neurobiology","last_mentioned_on":1421382521,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25583660?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25583660","pubdate":"2015-01-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Neuromolecular Mechanisms Mediating the Effects of Chronic Intermittent Hypoxia on Adrenal Medulla.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neuromolecular-mechanisms-mediating-effects-chronic-intermittent-hypoxia-adrenal-medulla"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4742359,"mean":5.4864603665373,"rank":3864510,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":122896,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4742359,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160192,"mean":8.612294685719,"rank":127372,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":627,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160192,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":373,"mean":2.3642096774194,"rank":248,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":373,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.4115384615385,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Psychology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hypoxiapapers\/status\/555944706551463937","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3071148],"posted_on":"2015-01-16T04:28:41+00:00","author":{"name":"Hypoxia Adaptation","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/491585034201989120\/716F2y0d_normal.png","description":"A feed for hypoxia related papers published in NCBI, ArXiv, bioArxiv, and PeerJ","id_on_source":"hypoxiapapers","tweeter_id":"2669362848","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":416},"tweet_id":"555944706551463937"}]}}
