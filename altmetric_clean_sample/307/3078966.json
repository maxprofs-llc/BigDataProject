In addition to obtaining clinical history and exam findings, diagnostic testing may be required, including hematological assessments. This article describes common blood collection methods, including venipuncture sites, the volume of blood that can be safely collected, and handling of the blood. Hematological parameters for normal guinea pigs are provided for comparison with in-house or commercial test results. A description of the morphology of guinea pig leukocytes is provided to assist in performing a differential count.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008c6c","doi":"10.1016\/j.cvex.2014.09.002","first_seen_on":"2015-01-19T22:36:40+00:00","issns":["10949194"],"journal":"Veterinary Clinics of North America: Exotic Animal Practice","last_mentioned_on":1421707265,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1094919414000589"],"pmid":"25421024","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Hematological Assessment in Pet Guinea Pigs (Cavia porcellus) Blood Sample Collection and Blood Cell Identification","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hematological-assessment-pet-guinea-pigs-cavia-porcellus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036026,"mean":5.9656490211997,"rank":2165972,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":2800993,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036026,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177900,"mean":8.5057148831641,"rank":69098,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":106149,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177900,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":1.5575757575758,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.85,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
