An imbalance between peptide production at the neuronal level and their elimination across the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) results in peptide accumulation inside the brain. The identification and functional characterization of the transport systems in the BBB with the capacity to transport A\u03b2 is crucial for the understanding of A\u03b2 peptide traffic from the brain to the blood. In this context, it has been suggested that the P-glycoprotein (P-gp), expressed in endothelial cells of the BBB, plays a role in the elimination of A\u03b2. However, there is little, if any, experimental evidence to support this; therefore, the aim of this investigation was to determine whether P-gp is capable of transporting A\u03b2 peptides. Our results show that ATPase activity measured in plasma membrane vesicles of K562 cells overexpressing P-gp is not increased by the presence of A\u03b242, suggesting that A\u03b242 is not a P-gp substrate. Similarly, P-gp of pirarubicin was unaffected by A\u03b242. Moreover, the overexpression of P-gp does not protect cells against A\u03b242 toxicity. Taken together, our results support the conclusion that A\u03b242 is not transported by P-gp.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e20","authors":["Ivan Bello","Milena Salerno"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12192-014-0566-8","first_seen_on":"2015-01-17T13:06:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1466-1268"],"journal":"Cell Stress and Chaperones","last_mentioned_on":1421493305,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25591827?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25591827","pubdate":"2015-01-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Evidence against a role of P-glycoprotein in the clearance of the Alzheimer's disease A\u03b21-42 peptides.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evidence-against-role-pglycoprotein-clearance-alzheimers-disease-a142-peptides"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4744682,"mean":5.4880204995978,"rank":2453917,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1663840,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4744682,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160381,"mean":8.5926881032548,"rank":82986,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":57611,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160381,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167,"mean":1.4028313253012,"rank":57,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":92,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.65,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
