The massage therapy and relaxation groups reported less depressed mood, anxiety, and pain immediately after their first and last sessions. By the end of the study, however, only the massage therapy group reported being less depressed and less angry and having more vigor. Dopamine levels, Natural Killer cells, and lymphocytes also increased from the first to the last day of the study for the massage therapy group. These findings highlight the benefit of these complementary therapies, most particularly massage therapy, for women with breast cancer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e78","authors":["Hernandez-Reif M","Field T","Ironson G","Beutler J","Vera Y","Hurley J","Fletcher MA","Schanberg S","Kuhn C","Fraser M","MARIA HERNANDEZ-REIF","TIFFANY FIELD","GAIL IRONSON","JULIA BEUTLER","YANEXY VERA","JUDITH HURLEY","MARY ANN FLETCHER","SAUL SCHANBERG","CYNTHIA KUHN","MONICA FRASER"],"doi":"10.1080\/00207450590523080","endpage":"510","first_seen_on":"2015-01-16T14:35:55+00:00","issns":["0020-7454","1543-5245"],"issue":"4","journal":"International Journal of Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1501860154,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15809216","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/00207450590523080","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15809216","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/00207450590523080?journalCode=ines20&utm_content=buffer42684&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/00207450590523080?journalCode=ines20&utm_content=bufferafab8&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmid":"15809216","pubdate":"2005-04-05T23:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"495","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"NATURAL KILLER CELLS AND LYMPHOCYTES INCREASE IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER FOLLOWING MASSAGE THERAPY","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/00207450590523080","volume":"115","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/natural-killer-cells-lymphocytes-increase-women-breast-cancer-following-massage-therapy-7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":19.75,"score_history":{"1y":12,"6m":11,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":19.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8320311,"mean":7.0122256031246,"rank":440989,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7878567,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8320311,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242922,"mean":8.1089192865171,"rank":16190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":226699,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242922,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":734,"mean":4.6664556616644,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":712,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":734,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":0.73214285714286,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
