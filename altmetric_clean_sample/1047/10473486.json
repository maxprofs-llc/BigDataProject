Acrp30 is structurally similar to complement factor C1q and to a hibernation-specific protein isolated from the plasma of Siberian chipmunks; it forms large homo-oligomers that undergo a series of post-translational modifications. Like adipsin, secretion of Acrp30 is enhanced by insulin, and Acrp30 is an abundant serum protein. Acrp30 may be a factor that participates in the delicately balanced system of energy homeostasis involving food intake and carbohydrate and lipid catabolism. Our experiments also further corroborate the existence of an insulin-regulated secretory pathway in adipocytes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Scherer, P E","Williams, S","Fogliano, M","Baldini, G","Lodish, H F"],"first_seen_on":"2016-08-13T10:24:42+00:00","issns":["0021-9258"],"issue":"45","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1471083879,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7592907"],"pmid":"7592907","pubdate":"1995-11-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"A novel serum protein similar to C1q, produced exclusively in adipocytes.","type":"article","volume":"270","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-serum-protein-similar-c1q-produced-exclusively-adipocytes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8208063,"mean":6.9506291146371,"rank":2089075,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4996931,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8208063,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":256897,"mean":12.007360643996,"rank":83428,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":169432,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":256897,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31087,"mean":3.2646878337515,"rank":3588,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":11456,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31087,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":422,"mean":5.5418052256532,"rank":105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":285,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":422,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":22,"Researcher":50,"Student  > Doctoral Student":30,"Student  > Ph.
