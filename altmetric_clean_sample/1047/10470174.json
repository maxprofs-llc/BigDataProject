Neuropathologically, FTLD is characterized by abnormal protein deposits and almost all cases can now be classified into three major molecular subgroups based on specific accumulating proteins with the most common being FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP (accounting for ~40% and 50%, respectively) and FTLD-FET (accounting for ~5-10%). In this special issue, the molecular and genetic basics as well as clinical approaches and therapeutics are reviewed in a series of articles. This article is part of the\u00a0Frontotemporal Dementia special issue.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e72","authors":["Haass, Christian","Neumann, Manuela"],"doi":"10.1111\/jnc.13619","endpage":"5","first_seen_on":"2016-08-13T06:09:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1471-4159"],"issue":"S1","journal":"Journal of Neurochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1472253440,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jnc.13619\/full","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/getIdentityKey?redirectTo=http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jnc.13619\/full?wol1URL%3D\/doi\/10.1111\/jnc.13619\/full&userIp=192.228.197.54&doi=10.1111\/jnc.13619","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27502123"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jnc.13619\/pdf","pmid":"27502123","pubdate":"2016-08-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"3","subjects":["chemistry","neurology"],"title":"Frontotemporal dementia: from molecular mechanisms to therapy","type":"article","volume":"138","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/frontotemporal-dementia-molecular-mechanisms-therapy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8282830,"mean":6.9841686085689,"rank":843058,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7404919,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8282830,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258123,"mean":11.998473008887,"rank":38656,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":218560,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258123,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2704,"mean":3.8044136145024,"rank":209,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":2473,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2704,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":4.952027027027,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
