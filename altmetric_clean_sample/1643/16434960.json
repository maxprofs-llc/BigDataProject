The most common lung cancer is non-small cell, which can consist of adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and large cell lung carcinoma. As per all solid tumours, the changes that occur for the initiation and metastasis of lung cancer can be described using the EMT (epithelial mesenchymal transition). Cells progressing through EMT lose their epithelial cell characteristics, expressing more mesenchymal markers and are phenotypically different. The transition can be controlled by changes in various pathways, such as TGF-\u03b2, PI3K, MAPK, Hedgehog and Wnt. The changes in those pathways can be controlled epigenetically, via DNA methylation, histone modifications or changes in small\/non-coding RNA. We will describe the epigenetic changes that occur in these pathways and how we can consider novel methods to generate a synthetic lethality target in an epigenetically regulated pathway in EMT.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002661","authors":["O'Leary, Karen","Shia, Alice","Schmid, Peter"],"doi":"10.2174\/1568009617666170203162556","first_seen_on":"2017-02-15T21:40:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-5576"],"journal":"Current Cancer Drug Targets","last_mentioned_on":1487122394,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28176646"],"pmid":"28176646","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms","antineoplasticagents"],"title":"Epigenetic Regulation of EMT in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epigenetic-regulation-emt-nonsmall-cell-lung-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8213437,"mean":6.9553152651275,"rank":7107749,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8213437,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":293421,"mean":12.575636895917,"rank":242553,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":293421,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":204,"mean":4.3377044334975,"rank":133,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":204,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.35,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"reddit":[{"title":"Epigenetic Regulation of EMT in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.","url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nsclc\/comments\/5u4iyp\/epigenetic_regulation_of_emt_in_nonsmall_cell\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[16434960],"posted_on":"2017-02-15T01:33:14+00:00","author":{"name":"montaukwhaler","url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nsclc","id_on_source":"nsclc","followers":1,"subreddit":"non small cell lung cancer"}}]}}
