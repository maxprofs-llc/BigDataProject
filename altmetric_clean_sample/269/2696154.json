While contextual challenges associated with improvement in primary care have been documented previously, we still know relatively little about how the intentional, theory-informed facilitation of evidence-based change is shaped by contextual factors within this healthcare setting. Hence, a qualitative study was conducted to address the question: How is the process of facilitating evidence-based practice affected by the context of primary care?","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b6","authors":["Tierney S","Kislov R","Deaton C","Stephanie Tierney","Roman Kislov","Christi Deaton"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2296-15-153","first_seen_on":"2014-09-19T00:20:22+00:00","issns":["1471-2296",""],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Family Practice","last_mentioned_on":1416741482,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2296\/15\/153\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2296-15-153.pdf","pmid":"25231215","pubdate":"2014-09-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"153","subjects":["primaryhealthcare"],"title":"A qualitative study of a primary-care based intervention to improve the management of patients with heart failure: the dynamic relationship between facilitation and context","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmcfampract.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2296-15-153","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/qualitative-study-primarycare-based-intervention-improve-management-patients-heart-failure-dynamic-r-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6926454,"mean":6.2203445183248,"rank":908940,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":6011771,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6926454,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185671,"mean":7.5552996499168,"rank":28513,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":156926,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185671,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":924,"mean":5.4462080173348,"rank":180,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":742,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":924,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":7.212,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":4,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
