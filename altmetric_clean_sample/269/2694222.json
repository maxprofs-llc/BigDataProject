This provides an assessment of nutrient adequacy and the prevalence of excessive intake, as well as the response with respect to biomarkers. Cod liver oil (CLO) is the most frequently consumed supplement in the UK, containing nutrients that might have varying influences on health. We calculated TNI for vitamins A, D and E, as well as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and assessed associations with the respective blood concentrations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002de6","authors":["M A H Lentjes","A A Mulligan","A A Welch","A Bhaniani","R N Luben","K-T Khaw","Lentjes MA","Mulligan AA","Welch AA","Bhaniani A","Luben RN","Khaw KT","Lentjes, M.
