Pregnancies in these patients carry several complications such as prematurity. Maternal IgG antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) can cross the placenta but they don't generally cause any neonatal thrombotic event. Because of the incompleteness of the fetal blood-brain barrier, aPL could theoretically reach the fetal brain. Whether this can have an effect on brain development is still under investigation. Some studies performed in children of patients with SLE and\/or APS showed an increased number of learning disabilities without impairment in intelligence level.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4fe3cf058f61000303a","authors":["C Nalli","A Iodice","L Andreoli","A Lojacono","M Motta","E Fazzi","A Tincani","Nalli C","Iodice A","Andreoli L","Lojacono A","Motta M","Fazzi E","Tincani A"],"doi":"10.1177\/0961203314538109","endpage":"1248","first_seen_on":"2014-09-17T10:01:01+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1477-0962","0961-2033"],"issue":"12","journal":"Lupus","last_mentioned_on":1411481798,"links":["http:\/\/lup.sagepub.com\/content\/23\/12\/1246.full?ijkey=FMLnIdCwcJHuE&keytype=ref&siteid=splup","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25228716","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25228716?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/lup.sagepub.com\/content\/23\/12\/1246.full.pdf","pmid":"25228716","pubdate":"2014-10-14T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1246","subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"Children born to SLE and APS mothers.","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/children-born-sle-aps-mothers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5482323,"mean":6.3664465294072,"rank":981442,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":4497025,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5482323,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":144591,"mean":8.5744908776542,"rank":30567,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":113862,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":144591,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":620,"mean":3.9349660743134,"rank":74,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":545,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":620,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":1.9143,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
