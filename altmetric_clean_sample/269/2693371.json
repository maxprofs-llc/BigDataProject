Does it change how you eat AT HOME?"],"citation":{"abstract":"Information regarding associations between types of away-from-home family meal sources and obesity and other chronic diseases could help guide dietetics practitioners. The present study describes the purchase frequency of away-from-home food sources for family dinner (fast food, other restaurant purchases, home delivery, and takeout foods) and associations with weight status and percent body fat among adolescents (n=723) and parents (n=723) and related biomarkers of chronic disease among adolescents (n=367). A cross-sectional study design was used with baseline parent surveys and anthropometry\/fasting blood samples from two community-based obesity studies (2006-2008) in Minnesota. Logistic regression and general linear modeling assessed associations between frequency of family dinner sources (weekly vs none in past week) and outcomes (parent and adolescent overweight\/obesity and percent body fat; adolescent metabolic risk cluster z score, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, fasting glucose, insulin, and systolic blood pressure. Models accounted for clustering and adjusted for study allocation, baseline meal frequency, and demographic characteristics. The odds of overweight\/obesity were considerably greater when families reported at least one away-from-home dinner purchase in the past week (odds ratio=1.2 to 2.6). Mean percent body fat, metabolic risk cluster z scores, and insulin levels were significantly greater with weekly purchases of family dinner from fast-food restaurants (P<0.05). Mean percent body fat, metabolic risk cluster z scores, and high-density lipoprotein levels were significantly higher for families who purchased weekly family dinner from takeout sources (P<0.05). Although frequent family dinners may be beneficial for adolescents, the source of dinners is likely as important in maintaining a healthy weight. Interventions should focus on encouragement of healthful family meals.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f6100040f7","authors":["Fulkerson JA","Farbakhsh K","Lytle L","Hearst MO","Dengel DR","Pasch KE","Kubik MY"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jada.2011.09.035","endpage":"1897","first_seen_on":"2014-09-18T05:22:02+00:00","funders":["nci","nhlbi"],"issns":["0002-8223","00028223"],"issue":"12","journal":"Journal of the American Dietetic Association","last_mentioned_on":1426550588,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0002822311016579","http:\/\/www.andjrnl.org\/article\/S0002-8223%2811%2901657-9\/fulltext","http:\/\/www.andjrnl.org\/article\/S0002-8223(11)01657-9\/fulltext"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.andjrnl.org\/article\/S0002822311016579\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC3230299","pmid":"22117665","pubdate":"2011-01-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Nursing","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"1892","subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Away-from-Home Family Dinner Sources and Associations with Weight Status, Body Composition, and Related Biomarkers of Chronic Disease among Adolescents and Their Parents","type":"article","volume":"111","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/awayfromhome-family-dinner-sources-associations-weight-status-body-composition-related-biomarkers-ch"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4873362,"mean":5.8020748091545,"rank":2245297,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2504666,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4873362,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":131386,"mean":8.4452068348748,"rank":55551,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":71302,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":131386,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":662,"mean":7.8962995461422,"rank":403,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":662,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":3,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
