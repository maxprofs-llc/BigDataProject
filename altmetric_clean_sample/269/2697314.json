Psychiatric symptoms may be the direct result of PD, its co-morbid pathologies, or occur as a side effect of its pharmacotherapy. Pramipexole, like other dopamine agonists for treating Parkinson's disease , has a tendency to induce psychotic and manic symptoms due to central dopaminergic stimulation. In this article, mania with psychotic feature induced by the use of dopamine agonists which is not observed frequently in the literature will be discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fd3cf058f61000607e","authors":["Meri\u00e7 C","Pirdo\u011fan E","G\u00fcnday Toker O","Tekin A","Bak\u0131m B","Celik S"],"first_seen_on":"2014-09-19T09:59:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":[],"issue":"3","journal":"Turk Psikiyatri Dergisi","last_mentioned_on":1411128960,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25219695?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25219695","pubdate":"2014-09-17T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"[Mania with Psychotic Feature Induced by the use of Pramipexole in Parkinson's Disease: A Case Report].","type":"article","volume":"25"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":2294603,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1620845,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118259,"mean":8.1465973041995,"rank":57085,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":48369,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118259,"percentile":40},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":1.1518987341772,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.75,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Bipolar_Blogs\/status\/512903554734891008","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2697314],"posted_on":"2014-09-19T09:58:31+00:00","author":{"name":"Bipolar Blogs","url":"http:\/\/www.pathsoflight.us\/bipolarwinds","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3605210516\/e9da8d6cabf3994c6ec4ab42483804b9_normal.png","description":"Blogs & news from the minds of people living with bipolar and researchers.
