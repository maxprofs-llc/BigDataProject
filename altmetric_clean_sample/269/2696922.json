However, it still remains unclear how the contemporary translation apparatus evolved from primitive prebiotic systems and at which stage of the evolution peptide synthesis emerged. Using simple molecular architectures, in which aminoacyl transfer of phenylalanine occurs either between two ends of a PNA stem loop structure, between two PNAs in a duplex, or between two PNAs assembled on a PNA template, we show that bona fide template instructed phenylalanine transfer can take place. Thus, we have identified conditions which allow template assisted intermolecular aminoacyl transfer using simple ester aminolysis chemistry primitively analogous to the ribosomal peptidyl transferase reaction in the absence of anchimeric assistance from ribose and ribosome catalysis. These results help define the minimum chemical boundary conditions for the translation process and also give insight into the possibilities for the prebiotic emergence of RNA-independent translation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006811","authors":["Abhishek Singhal"],"doi":"10.1021\/cb5005349","first_seen_on":"2014-09-19T06:42:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":[],"journal":"ACS Chemical Biology","last_mentioned_on":1411108923,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/cb5005349"],"pmid":"25192412","pubdate":"2014-09-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology","biochemistry"],"title":"Towards Peptide Nucleic Acid (PNA) Directed Peptide Translation Using Ester Based Aminoacyl Transfer.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/toward-peptide-nucleic-acid-pna-directed-peptide-translation-using-ester-based-aminoacyl-transfer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4508925,"mean":5.2085143105191,"rank":3033624,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":905402,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4508925,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118278,"mean":8.4016247960299,"rank":77407,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":26394,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118278,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1027,"mean":3.7516140350877,"rank":692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1027,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":5.856,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
