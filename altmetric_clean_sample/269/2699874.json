However, exclusion of animal products in vegetarian diets may affect the cobalamin status and cause an elevation of the plasma homocysteine level. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of vegetarian diets on serum concentrations of homocysteine, folate, vitamin B12 and total antioxidant status (TAS) in children.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5183cf058f610003833","authors":["Ambroszkiewicz J","Klemarczyk W","Che\u0142chowska M","Gajewska J","Laskowska-Klita T"],"first_seen_on":"2014-09-20T08:30:53+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Advances in Medical Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1411201828,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/17357323\/?i=2&from=\/22006487\/related"],"pmid":"17357323","pubdate":"2007-03-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Serum homocysteine, folate, vitamin B12 and total antioxidant status in vegetarian children.","type":"article","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/serum-homocysteine-folate-vitamin-b12-total-antioxidant-status-vegetarian-children-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":3553577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":836941,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":135357,"mean":8.56449330654,"rank":91899,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":26541,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":135357,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98,"mean":1.0045360824742,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.7,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
