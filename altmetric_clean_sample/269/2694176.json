Bicompartmental replacement has been considered lately as an alternative for combined medial and patellofemoral arthritis. The main idea behind these resurfacing solutions is tissue preservation with conservation of bone stock and both cruciate ligaments. Tricompartmental replacement with selective resurfacing of all three compartments with different modular implants is exceptional.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fc0","doi":"10.1016\/j.knee.2014.03.008","first_seen_on":"2014-09-18T10:55:23+00:00","issns":["0968-0160"],"issue":"4","journal":"Knee","last_mentioned_on":1411037643,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0968016014000635"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.thekneejournal.com\/article\/S0968016014000635\/pdf","pmid":"24811190","pubdate":"2014-01-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"875","subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Tricompartmental resurfacing arthroplasty with a follow-up of more than 30\u2005years","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tricompartmental-resurfacing-arthroplasty-followup-more-30years"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":4199254,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":134979,"mean":8.5358069018657,"rank":108506,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":134979,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":305,"mean":2.6064934210526,"rank":254,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":305,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":2.8222222222222,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
