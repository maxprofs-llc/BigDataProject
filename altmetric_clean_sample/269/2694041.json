Approximately 1\/5 of Danish adults have MS, which has an etiological relation to nutritional factors, sleep patterns, work-related stress, fatigue, and physical activity - all of which are critical issues at sea.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9243cf058f61000db65","authors":["M\u00f8ller Pedersen SF","Jepsen JR"],"first_seen_on":"2014-09-18T10:26:58+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"4","journal":"International maritime health","last_mentioned_on":1411035999,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24408138?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24408138","pubdate":"2014-01-12T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["militarymedicine"],"title":"The metabolic syndrome among Danish seafarers.","type":"article","volume":"64","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metabolic-syndrome-among-danish-seafarers-followup-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4272066,"mean":5.0492039646496,"rank":3396967,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":123105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4272066,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113073,"mean":8.0834753962078,"rank":89824,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":671,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113073,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":1.984,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
