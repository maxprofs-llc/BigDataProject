In addition, comparisons between the costs of CW facilities based on various alternative construction materials, i.e., reinforced concrete and earth structures (covered with either high density polyethylene or clay), are presented in relation to the required area. The results show that earth structures are economically advantageous. The derived equations can be used for providing a preliminary cost estimate of CW facilities for domestic wastewater treatment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53c3cf058f610004715","authors":["Gkika D","Dimitra Gkika","Georgios D.
