The plantations were located in Youxian County, Hunan Province in central China. The trees in these plantations were of different ages (3, 13, and 26 years) and belonged to different ecological successions (first, second, and third successions). The total dataset comprised 94922 high quality sequences with an average length of 436 bp. The dominant taxonomic groups across all samples were Chordata, Annelida, Arthropoda, Nematoda, Rotifera and Platyhelminthes with each accounting for 60.8%, 24.0%, 7.4%, 3.6%, 1.5% and 1.2% of the sequences, respectively. There were significant differences in ACE index and Shannon index among the five plantations. The lowest diversity of soil microfauna was in the 13-year old plantation of the first ecological succession. The correlation analysis showed that both ACE and available potassium concentration were negatively correlated to the Chaol index. However, there were no significant correlations between the Shannon, Simpson indices and the physical-chemical properties of soil. Overall, the Jaccard's similarity coefficient was less than 0.4 among samples at each site, and significant differences were found among plantations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067ac","authors":["Sheng-Jie Wang","Jun-Ang Liu","Yuan-Hao He","Guo-Ying Zhou","Yi-Min Tan","Jie-Chen Zhou"],"first_seen_on":"2014-09-17T10:36:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1001-9332"],"issue":"6","journal":"Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao","last_mentioned_on":1445110811,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25223021?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25223021","pubdate":"2014-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"[Soil microfauna diversity among Cunninghamia lanceolata plantations based on pyrosequencing].","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/competition-diversification-effects-supply-chains-supplier-default-risk"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6278272,"mean":5.9867156995941,"rank":2761962,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3349701,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6278272,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":152448,"mean":8.3403612534194,"rank":70346,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":76120,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":152448,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":388,"mean":0.5478811369509,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":355,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":388,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":0.61034482758621,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
