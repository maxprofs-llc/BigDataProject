The microbiological quality of 11 types of fresh, raw vegetables (romaine lettuce, sesame leaves, crown daisy, garlic chives, iceberg lettuce, cabbage, broccoli, leek, chili pepper, capsicum, and zucchini) purchased at retail markets in Iksan, Korea as affected by cultivation method (environmentally friendly vegetables [organic, pesticide-free, and low-pesticide vegetables] and conventionally grown vegetables) and harvest season was determined. Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella were not detected in all samples of vegetables tested. Aerobic mesophiles (>6 log cfu\/g) were detected in environmentally friendly romaine lettuce and crown daisy and environmentally friendly and conventionally grown garlic chives, which also contained coliforms (>3 log cfu\/g). Sesame leaf and crown daisy (regardless of cultivation method), as well as conventionally grown romaine lettuce and leek, contained >1 log cfu\/g of E. coli. The overall microbiological quality of environmentally friendly and conventionally grown vegetables was not significantly different (P > 0.05). However, there were seasonal effects on populations of coliforms and generic E. coli on vegetables. The greatest numbers of microorganisms were isolated from environmentally friendly or conventionally grown vegetables purchased in winter. The vegetables, regardless of cultivation method or season, should be subjected to appropriate antimicrobial treatment to enhance their microbial safety.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fe9","authors":["Ryu, Jee\u2010Hoon","Kim, Minju","Kim, Eun\u2010Gyeong","Beuchat, Larry R.","Kim, Hoikyung"],"doi":"10.1111\/1750-3841.12531","endpage":"M1744","first_seen_on":"2014-09-19T09:01:07+00:00","issns":["1750-3841","0022-1147"],"issue":"9","journal":"Journal of Food Science","last_mentioned_on":1411117217,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1750-3841.12531\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1750-3841.12531\/pdf","pmid":"25124136","pubdate":"2014-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"M1739","subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Comparison of the Microbiological Quality of Environmentally Friendly and Conventionally Grown Vegetables Sold at Retail Markets in Korea","type":"article","volume":"79","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-microbiological-quality-environmentally-friendly-conventionally-grown-vegetables-sold-ret"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6650235,"mean":6.1594803042994,"rank":4919950,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":975916,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6650235,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184489,"mean":7.507002168163,"rank":119277,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":37395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184489,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1331,"mean":6.7383654135338,"rank":863,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":316,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1331,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":2.6441694915254,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
