Direct relationship between PD and various single nuclear polymorphisms of \u03b1Syn further displays an inherent significance of mutated \u03b1Syn in increasing the risk for developing PD. So far, various theories have emerged to explain \u03b1Syn mediated neuronal cell toxicity seen in patients with PD, including interaction of \u03b1Syn aggregates with biomolecules, vesicle dystrafficking, augmented oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and disruption of synaptic function. Despite the advances in understanding of PD pathophysiology, current available treatments are still aimed at giving symptomatic relief. Lately PD vaccines against \u03b1Syn aggregates are also being considered. However, various other avenues (e.g. post-translational and conformational modifications of \u03b1Syn, effect of cellular small molecules such as polyamines and osmolytes on \u03b1Syn aggregation) still remains unexplored and we believe that therapeutics directed at these ignored targets will surface as a successful combinational therapy for PD. Additionally, understanding mechanisms behind the interplay between PD and other health conditions, such as Gaucher's disease, Cardiovascular disorders, Hypertension, Homocystinuria, Type-II Diabetes, and Cancer; are also speculated to provide great insight for novel therapeutic interventions. In the current review, we have precisely discussed all these ignored avenues with their possible clinical implications. Link between PD and other associated diseases have also been extensively reviewed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002584","authors":["R K Chowhan","S Mittal","T A Dar","M A Kamal","L R Singh"],"first_seen_on":"2014-09-18T10:21:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1996-3181"],"journal":"CNS & Neurological Disorders - Drug Targets","last_mentioned_on":1411035663,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25230221?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25230221","pubdate":"2014-09-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Ignored Avenues in Alpha-Synuclein Associated Proteopathy.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ignored-avenues-alphasynuclein-associated-proteopathy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":2294555,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1620921,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118013,"mean":8.0996242077079,"rank":56963,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":48259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118013,"percentile":40},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":318,"mean":2.3978107255521,"rank":130,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":158,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":318,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":2.534,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Ph.
