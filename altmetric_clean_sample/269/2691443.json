Cells of strain EGI 80099T were Gram-positive, non-motile, non-endospore-forming cocci. The predominant menaquinones were MK-7, MK-8 and MK-9. The major cellular fatty acids (> 10 %) were anteiso-C15:0 and anteiso-C17:0. Analysis of the cell wall showed the presence of peptidoglycan of the type L-Lys-Gly-L-Glu, variation A4\u03b1. Cells of the isolate contained phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, an unknown phospholipid and an unidentified glycolipid as polar lipids. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 63.4 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain EGI 80099T belongs to the genus Nesterenkonia, sharing 95.68-97.37% sequence similarities with the type strains of recognized species within this genus. DNA-DNA hybridization of strain EGI 80099T with the type strains of species that showed the highest sequence similarities, Nesterenkonia aethiopica DSM 17733T (97.37%), Nesterenkonia flava CAAS251T (97.23%) and Nesterenkonia xinjiangensis YIM 70097T (97.02%), gave relatedness values of 8.7-62.2%. Data from DNA-DNA hybridizations and physiological and biochemical tests indicated that strain EGI 80099T represents a novel species of the genus Nesterenkonia, for which the name Nesterenkonia rhizosphaerae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is EGI 80099T (=BCRC 16947T =JCM 19129T).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079fb","authors":["Hong-Fei Wang","Yong-Guang Zhang","Ji-Yue Chen","Wael N Hozzein","Li Li","Mohammed A M Wadaan","Yuan-Ming Zhang","Wen-Jun Li"],"doi":"10.1099\/ijs.0.066894-0","first_seen_on":"2014-09-17T14:40:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1466-5034"],"journal":"International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1425148145,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25225260?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25225260","pubdate":"2014-09-15T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Nesterenkonia rhizosphaerae sp. nov., a novel alkaliphilic actinobacterium isolated from rhizosphere soil of Reaumuria soongorica in saline-alkaline desert.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nesterenkonia-rhizosphaerae-sp-nov-alkaliphilic-actinobacterium-isolated-rhizosphere-soil-salinealka"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4814322,"mean":5.7520175995776,"rank":2388458,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2280707,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4814322,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127773,"mean":8.5305784365903,"rank":59940,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":62435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127773,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2285,"mean":2.5158239929947,"rank":1389,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":843,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2285,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85,"mean":0.78333333333333,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
