This review focuses on behavioral parent training interventions for school-age children in the home setting and adjunctive treatments developed to extend effects across settings. Empirical support includes numerous randomized clinical trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses showing positive effects of these interventions on child compliance, ADHD symptoms and impairments, parent-child interactions, parenting and parenting stress. These studies support categorization of behavior management treatment as a well-established, evidence-based treatment of ADHD. Factors for consideration in clinical decision making and directions for research are provided.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e6c","authors":["Pfiffner LJ","Haack LM","Linda J.
