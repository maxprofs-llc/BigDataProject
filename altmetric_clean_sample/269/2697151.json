In particular a lot of attention has been directed towards its high pressure behavior, where an isostructural volume collapse (\u03b3 phase \u2192 \u03b1 phase) has been observed. Two main models of the electronic aspect of this transformation have been proposed; one where the 4f electron undergoes a change from being localized into an itinerant metallic state, and one where the focus is on the interaction between the 4f electron and the conduction electrons, often referred to as the Kondo volume collapse model. However, over the years it has been repeatedly questioned whether the cerium collapse really is isostructural. Most recently, detailed experiments have been able to remove this worrisome uncertainty. Therefore the isostructural aspect of the \u03b1-\u03b3 transition has now to be seriously addressed in the theoretical modeling, something which has been very much neglected. A study of this fundamental characteristic of the cerium volume collapse is made in present paper and we show that the localized [rlhar2 ] delocalized 4f electron picture provides an adequate description of this unique behavior. This agreement makes it possible to suggest that an appropriate crossroad position for cerium in The Periodic Table.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["B\u00f6rje Johansson","Wei Luo","Sa Li","Rajeev Ahuja"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep06398","first_seen_on":"2014-09-19T08:33:04+00:00","issns":["xxxx-xxxx","2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1469428647,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/srep\/2014\/140917\/srep06398\/full\/srep06398.html","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/srep06398"],"pmid":"25227991","pubdate":"2014-09-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Electronic properties and materials","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Electronic structure","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"6398","subjects":["science"],"title":"Cerium; Crystal Structure and Position in The Periodic Table","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cerium-crystal-structure-position-periodic-table"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082038,"mean":6.8946982576228,"rank":1887622,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6158854,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082038,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191190,"mean":7.8875769108058,"rank":47696,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":142553,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191190,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33555,"mean":14.904648149252,"rank":11127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":22261,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33555,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":571,"mean":12.150389473684,"rank":185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":382,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":571,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
