The group was aimed at addressing eating disorder symptoms associated with body dissatisfaction in the later stages of outpatient treatment.\n33 adults with a DSM-5 diagnosis of an eating disorder participated in the ERP group. Participants completed pre- and post-ERP group measures of depression, anxiety, self-evaluation based on body image, restraint, eating concern, weight concern, shape concern, upward and downward appearance comparisons, and patient satisfaction.\nInvolvement in the ERP group was associated with significant decreases in self-evaluation based on body image, restraint, eating concern, weight concern, shape concern, and upward physical appearance comparisons post-group treatment. This adjunct treatment group was well received and viewed as being helpful by participants.\nERP in a group therapy format for addressing body dissatisfaction may represent a complimentary approach to current evidence-based treatments for an eating disorder, and warrant further investigation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6153cf058f6100071b4","authors":["Brad A.
