The main points considered in the study's design and challenges faced in its application are detailed.\nThis observational, longitudinal, prospective study involved collection of gastrointestinal biopsy specimens, faeces, urine, and blood from 25 obese women with T2DM who were candidates for RYGB (20 patients for omics assessment and 5 for omics validation). These collections were performed preoperatively and 3 and 24 months postoperatively. Gastrointestinal transcriptomics; faecal metagenomics and metabolomics; plasma proteomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics; and biochemical, nutritional, and metabolic data were assessed to identify their short- and long-term correlations with T2DM remission.\nData were collected from 20 patients before and 3 months after RYGB. These patients have nearly completed the 2-year follow-up assessments. The five additional patients are currently being selected for omics data validation.\nThe multi-integrated pan-omics approach of the SURMetaGIT study enables integrated analysis of data that will contribute to the understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in T2DM remission after RYGB.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cf4","authors":["Priscila Sala","Giliane Belarmino","Natasha Mendon\u00e7a Machado","Camila Siqueira Cardinelli","Karina Al Assal","Mariane Marques Silva","Danielle Cristina Fonseca","Robson Kiyoshi Ishida","Marco Aur\u00e9lio Santo","Eduardo Guimar\u00e3es Hourneaux de Moura","Paulo Sakai","Ismael Francisco Mota Siqueira Guarda","Ismael Dale Cotrim Guerreiro da Silva","Agatha Sacramento Rodrigues","Carlos Alberto de Bragan\u00e7a Pereira","Steven Heymsfield","Joel Dor\u00e9","Raquel Susana Matos de Miranda Torrinhas","Daniel Giannella-Neto","Dan Linetzky Waitzberg"],"doi":"10.1177\/0300060516667862","first_seen_on":"2016-11-12T21:17:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1473-2300"],"journal":"Journal of International Medical Research","last_mentioned_on":1479227580,"links":["http:\/\/imr.sagepub.com\/lookup\/doi\/10.1177\/0300060516667862","http:\/\/imr.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2016\/11\/09\/0300060516667862.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/imr.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2016\/11\/09\/0300060516667862.full.pdf","pmid":"27834300","pubdate":"2016-11-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"The SURMetaGIT study: Design and rationale for a prospective pan-omics examination of the gastrointestinal response to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/surmetagit-study-design-rationale-prospective-panomics-examination-gastrointestinal-response-rouxeny"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.33,"score_history":{"1y":7.33,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.33},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7695823,"mean":6.6062009433119,"rank":1033245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":6659878,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7695823,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229934,"mean":12.971643304789,"rank":47630,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":181765,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229934,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":480,"mean":2.9339916492693,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":449,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":480,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":6.5558181818182,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
