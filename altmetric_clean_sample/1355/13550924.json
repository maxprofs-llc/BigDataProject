Indirect evidence suggests that thiamine may contribute to these pathologies by controlling the activities of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3\u03b2. While decreased GSK-3\u03b2 activity appears to impair memory, increased GSK-3\u03b2 activity is associated with the distressed\/depressed state. However, hitherto direct evidence for the effects of thiamine on GSK-3\u03b2 function has not been reported. Here, we administered thiamine or, the more bioavailable precursor, benfotiamine at 200mg\/kg\/day for 2weeks to C57BL\/6J mice, to determine whether treatment might affect behaviours that are known to be sensitive to GSK-3\u03b2 activity and whether such administration impacts on GSK-3\u03b2 expression within the brain. The mice were tested in models of contextual conditioning and extinction, a 5-day rat exposure stress test, and a modified swim test with repeated testing. The tricyclic antidepressant imipramine (7.5mg\/kg\/day), was administered as a positive control for the effects of thiamine or benfotiamine. As for imipramine, both compounds inhibited the upregulation of GSK-3\u03b2 induced by predator stress or repeated swimming, and reduced floating scores and the predator stress-induced behavioural changes in anxiety and exploration. Coincident, thiamine and benfotiamine improved learning and extinction of contextual fear, and the acquisition of the step-down avoidance task. Our data indicate that thiamine and benfotiamine have antidepressant\/anti-stress effects in na\u00efve animals that are associated with reduced GSK-3\u03b2 expression and conditioning of adverse memories. Thus thiamine and benfotiamine may modulate GSK-3\u03b2 functions in a manner that is dependent on whether the contextual conditioning is adaptive or maladaptive.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033b5","authors":["Markova, Nataliia","Bazhenova, Nataliia","Anthony, Daniel C","Vignisse, Julie","Svistunov, Andrey","Lesch, Klaus-Peter","Bettendorff, Lucien","Strekalova, Tatyana","Nataliia Markova","Nataliia Bazhenova","Daniel C.
