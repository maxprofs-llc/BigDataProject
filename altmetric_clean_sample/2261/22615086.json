Despite these two enzymes share a 49% sequence identity and present a very similar three-dimensional structure, they show profound differences when comparing the specific activity for CO2 hydration reaction, with CA VII being much more active than CA III. Recently, CA III and CA VII have been proposed to play a new role as scavenger enzymes in cells where oxidative damage occurs. Here, we will examine functional and structural features of these two isoforms giving insights into their newly proposed protective role against oxidative stress.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fd5","authors":["Daria M.
