Few naturally occurring NA noncompetitive inhibitors were docked in the regulatory site of H5N1-NA and the binding interactions of endogenous ligand sialic acid in the active site was probed using molecular dynamics (MD) studies. Docking and MD simulation studies demonstrated that the sialic acid was docked in non-native pose owing to change in active site. The alteration in active site was due to change in orientation of Arg 371, one of the critical residues involved in binding of sialic acid. Based on the above-developed model newer analogs of the natural inhibitors were designed. Furthermore, a representative chalcone and flavone derivative was synthesized and evaluated for NA noncompetitive inhibition. The activity of synthesized chalcone derivative was similar to natural analog (isoliquiritgenin). Lineweaver-Burk plots for these synthesized representative derivatives confirmed their noncompetitive inhibition as illustrated by computational studies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5233cf058f610003b2f","authors":["Chintakrindi, Anand S","Martis, Elvis A F","Gohil, Devanshi J","Kothari, Sweta T","Chowdhary, Abhay S","Coutinho, Evans C","Kanyalkar, Meena A"],"first_seen_on":"2016-07-16T08:55:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1875-6697"],"journal":"Current Computer-Aided Drug Design","last_mentioned_on":1468659316,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27412704?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27412704?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pmid":"27412704","pubdate":"2016-07-16T22:03:13+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicalinformatics","pharmacology"],"title":"A Computational Model for Docking of Noncompetitive Neuraminidase Inhibitors and Probing their Binding Interactions with Neuraminidase of Influenza Virus H5N1.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/computational-model-docking-noncompetitive-neuraminidase-inhibitors-probing-binding-interactions-neu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8078414,"mean":6.8578859978971,"rank":6134990,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1084702,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8078414,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259425,"mean":11.759471536943,"rank":182938,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":41004,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259425,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":5.0467213114754,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":4,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
