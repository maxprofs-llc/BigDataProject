All oils were found to inhibit adduct formation very significantly and in a dose-dependent manner. The adduct formation appeared to be modulated through the action on microsomal enzymes, because an effective inhibition on the formation of activated metabolite was observed with each oil. The enzymatic modulation is perhaps due to the chemical constituents of the oils, and this could form a basis for their potential anticarcinogenic roles.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f61000149f","authors":["Hashim, S","Aboobaker, V S","Madhubala, R","Bhattacharya, R K","Rao, A R","Shehla Hashim","V.
