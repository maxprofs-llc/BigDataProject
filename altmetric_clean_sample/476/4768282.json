We are reporting a first case of asymptomatic bacteriuria caused by Chromobacterium violaceum in a 16-year-old male. With the reporting of the C. violaceum which is notorious for its high propensity for hematogenous dissemination causing fatal sepsis (with reported mortality rate up to 65-80%) if prompt proper treatment is not given, as causative agent of asymptomatic bacteriuria, it is recommended to treat the asymptomatic bacteriuria caused by this organism.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5203cf058f610003a3e","authors":["Narayan Dutt Pant","Manisha Sharma","Saroj Khatiwada"],"doi":"10.1155\/2015\/652036","first_seen_on":"2015-11-16T20:33:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1687-9627"],"journal":"Case Reports in Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1447705998,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4609412\/"],"pmid":"26504464","pubdate":"2015-11-16T20:15:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","title":"Asymptomatic Bacteriuria Caused by Chromobacterium violaceum in an Immunocompetent Adult","type":"article","volume":"2015","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-caused-ichromobacterium-violaceumi-immunocompetent-adult"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6574363,"mean":6.0951058539218,"rank":4863255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":966224,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6574363,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193049,"mean":10.264899434338,"rank":132726,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":39348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193049,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":449,"mean":2.0231160714286,"rank":213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":163,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":449,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.95,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
