Recent progress in understanding the molecular biology of GC and the related signaling pathways offers, from the clinical point of view, promising advances for selected groups of patients. In the past, targeted therapies have significantly impacted the treatment strategy of several common solid tumors such as breast, colorectal, and lung cancers. Unfortunately, translational and clinical research shows fewer encouraging targeted treatments with regards to the GC. To date, only two monoclonal antibodies (mAb), named trastuzumab and ramucirumab, are approved for the treatment of advanced GC, suggesting that in GC, maybe more than in other cancers, effective targeted therapy requires patient selection based on precise predictive molecular biomarkers. The aim of this review is to summarize the available data on the clinical advantages offered by the use of mAbs in the treatment of advanced\/metastatic GC. Future perspective is also discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008c15","authors":["Giandomenico Roviello","Karol Polom","Roberto Petrioli","Luigi Marano","Daniele Marrelli","Giovanni Paganini","Vinno Savelli","Daniele Generali","Lorenzo De Franco","Andrea Ravelli","Franco Roviello"],"doi":"10.1007\/s13277-015-4408-9","first_seen_on":"2015-11-14T16:01:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1423-0380"],"journal":"Tumor Biology","last_mentioned_on":1447586883,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs13277-015-4408-9","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26566626?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs13277-015-4408-9.pdf","pmid":"26566626","pubdate":"2015-11-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Monoclonal antibodies-based treatment in gastric cancer: current status and future perspectives.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/monoclonal-antibodiesbased-treatment-gastric-cancer-current-status-future-perspectives"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6569769,"mean":6.0903787716706,"rank":5604242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6569769,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208333,"mean":10.102730094273,"rank":165887,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208333,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1683,"mean":0.95309631391201,"rank":875,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1683,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285,"mean":0.64260563380282,"rank":118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/665853767737176064","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4762299],"posted_on":"2015-11-15T11:28:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":722},"tweet_id":"665853767737176064"}]}}
