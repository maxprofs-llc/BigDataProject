The disruption in the tight balance of neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective processes in an immune-privileged site like retina is proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of AMD. One of the main neuroprotective mediators in the central nervous system is BDNF with its serum level notably affected in several neurodegenerative disorders.\nThirty-six patients with AMD and 36 age-matched controls were enrolled in this study. The serum level of BDNF was measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Results were analyzed to compare case and control values. Comparisons were also made between the BDNF level of wet- vs dry-AMD, and male vs female patients and controls. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Student's t-test were employed to analyze the data.\nThe mean BDNF levels in AMD group were significantly higher than the control group. Furthermore, our analysis revealed greater BDNF values in all AMD subgroups compared to controls (P=0.004, 0.005, 0.001 and 0.02 for male wet-AMD, male dry-AMD, female wet-AMD and female dry-AMD vs controls, respectively). The BDNF level however did not vary between wet- and dry-AMD patients (P=0.74). While within-group comparisons in males and females of AMD and control groups did not show any difference in BDNF (P=0.16, 0.64 and 0.85 for wet-AMD, dry-AMD and control groups, respectively), between-group data showed a higher mean BDNF in both male and female AMD subjects than their peer controls.\nThis study demonstrated that the serum BDNF level is different in patients with AMD as compared to subjects without AMD. Future attempts should be done to unravel beneficial or deleterious effect of this neurotrophin in the pathogenesis of AMD.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef752a83ee09648b51cd","authors":["Afarid, Mehrdad","Torabi-Nami, Mohammad","Nemati, Alijan","Khosravi, Amir","Malekzadeh, Mahyar"],"doi":"10.3980\/j.issn.2222-3959.2015.05.25","first_seen_on":"2015-11-14T00:15:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2222-3959"],"issue":"5","journal":"International Journal of Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1447456614,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26558215"],"pmid":"26558215","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor in patients with advanced age-related macular degeneration.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/brainderived-neurotrophic-factor-patients-advanced-agerelated-macular-degeneration-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6564711,"mean":6.0829954575298,"rank":875425,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":5634705,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6564711,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208284,"mean":10.100616699395,"rank":40607,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":165768,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208284,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":149,"mean":1.2773648648649,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":143,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":149,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Student  > Ph.
