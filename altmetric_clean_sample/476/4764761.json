Understanding the molecular biology of survival and proliferation of cancer cells led to a new molecular classification of lung cancer and the development of targeted therapies with promising results. With the advances of image-guided biopsy techniques, tumor samples are becoming smaller, and the molecular testing techniques have to overcome the challenge of integrating the characterization of a panel of abnormalities including gene mutations, copy-number changes, and fusions in a reduced number of assays using only a small amount of genetic material. This article reviews the current knowledge about the most frequent actionable molecular abnormalities in non-small cell lung carcinoma, the new approaches of molecular analysis, and the implications of these findings in the context of clinical practice.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100057c7","authors":["Ileana, Ecaterina E","Wistuba, Ignacio I","Izzo, Julie G"],"doi":"10.1097\/ppo.0000000000000150","first_seen_on":"2015-11-15T23:06:01+00:00","issns":["1540-336X","1528-9117"],"issue":"5","journal":"Cancer Journal","last_mentioned_on":1447628739,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/journalppo\/Abstract\/2015\/09000\/From_Uniplex_to_Multiplex_Molecular_Profiling_in.10.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/journalppo\/2015\/09000\/From_Uniplex_to_Multiplex_Molecular_Profiling_in.10.pdf","pmid":"26389767","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"413","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"From Uniplex to Multiplex Molecular Profiling in Advanced Non\u2013Small Cell Lung Carcinoma","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/uniplex-multiplex-molecular-profiling-advanced-nonsmall-cell-lung-carcinoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6569769,"mean":6.0903787716706,"rank":4859579,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":965529,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6569769,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208010,"mean":10.065767106231,"rank":142645,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":42439,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208010,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":414,"mean":1.8538159806295,"rank":213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":414,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":2.5833333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PPO_journal_lww\/statuses\/666029322067513344","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4764761],"posted_on":"2015-11-15T23:05:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Journal","url":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/journalppo\/pages\/default.aspx","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1119215853\/Untitled-3_normal.jpg","description":"Provides an integrated view of modern oncology across all disciplines & publishes original research & reviews, & keeps readers current.","id_on_source":"PPO_journal_lww","tweeter_id":"188008773","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":38},"tweet_id":"666029322067513344"}]}}
