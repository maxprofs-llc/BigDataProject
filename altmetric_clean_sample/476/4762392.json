Through Internet and telephone queries, we identified 1054 team physicians from 362 institutions, including 120 randomly selected high schools and colleges and 122 professional teams (baseball, basketball, football, hockey). For all physicians included in the study, we performed a comprehensive search of the Internet and of a citation database to determine academic affiliations, number of publications, and h-index values. Of the 1054 physicians, 678 (64%) were orthopedic surgeons. Percentage of orthopedic team physicians affiliated with an academic medical center was highest in professional sports (64%; 173\/270) followed by collegiate sports (36%; 98\/275) and high school sports (20%; 27\/133). Median number of publications per orthopedic team physician was significantly higher in professional sports (30.6) than in collegiate sports (10.7) or high school sports (6). Median number of publications by orthopedic physicians also varied by sport, with the highest number in Major League Baseball (37.9; range, 0-225) followed by the National Basketball Association (32.0; range, 0-227) and the National Football League (30.4; range, 0-460), with the lowest number within the National Hockey League (20.7; range, 0-144). Academic affiliation and research productivity of orthopedic team physicians vary by competition level and professional sporting league.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f610006987","authors":["Makhni, Eric C","Buza, John A","Byram, Ian","Ahmad, Christopher S"],"first_seen_on":"2015-11-14T16:34:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1934-3418"],"issue":"11","journal":"The American Journal of Orthopedics","last_mentioned_on":1447581669,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26566551"],"pmid":"26566551","pubdate":"2015-11-14T22:00:06+00:00","subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Academic Characteristics of Orthopedic Team Physicians Affiliated With High School, Collegiate, and Professional Teams.","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/academic-characteristics-orthopedic-team-physicians-affiliated-high-school-collegiate-professional-t"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6569769,"mean":6.0903787716706,"rank":1347382,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":5210588,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6569769,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208333,"mean":10.102712094158,"rank":56952,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":150789,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208333,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125,"mean":1.7998064516129,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":2.05,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Decision Sciences":1,"Sports and Recreations":1,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":5,"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RetractionWatch\/statuses\/665568283630792704","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4762392],"posted_on":"2015-11-14T16:33:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Retraction Watch","url":"http:\/\/retractionwatch.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643054201438793729\/U_YUjFeu_normal.jpg","description":"Tracking retractions as a window into the scientific process.
