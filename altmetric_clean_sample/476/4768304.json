We examined whether local physicians followed this recommendation and what types of imaging examinations were ordered in a cohort of patients with local prostate cancer.\nThe Rochester Epidemiology Project, a research consortium that collects, links, and stores medical record information of Olmsted County, Minnesota, residents, was used to capture the complete medical history of treated patients with prostate cancer from 2000 through 2011. Clinical information and imaging examinations performed were retrieved by chart review. Suspected recurrence was defined as treatment-specific prostate-specific antigen level elevations, bone pain, or abnormal digital rectal examination findings.\nOf the 670 treated patients with prostate cancer who were included in the final analysis, 129 (19%) underwent posttreatment imaging. After excluding imaging related to retreatment or another cancer, 13 patients (i.e., 2% of the entire cohort and 10% of imaged patients) underwent imaging in the absence of suspected recurrence. A total of 90 patients (70% of imaged patients) underwent imaging after suspected recurrence. Of these 90 patients, 62 (69%) underwent a bone scan as their first imaging modality either alone or in combination with other imaging modalities. Of the providers who ordered a bone scan first, 27% were urologists, 23% were radiation oncologists, and 24% were primary care physicians.\nMost patients in this study did not undergo imaging in the absence of suspected recurrence. Various types of imaging examinations were ordered for patients with suspected recurrence.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f61000698d","authors":["Jennifer S.
