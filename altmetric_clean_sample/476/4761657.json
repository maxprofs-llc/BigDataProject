Previous studies have identified a decreased elastin to collagen ratio in hypertrophic LF. Among the extracellular matrix remodeling endopeptidases, MMP-2 and MMP-9 are known to have elastolytic activity. The hypothesis that activated LF cells exposed to inflammation would secrete MMP-2 and MMP-9, thereby resulting in elastin degradation, was examined. METHODS To examine MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in human LF, cells were isolated and cultured from LF tissues that were obtained during lumbar disc surgery. Isolated LF cells were equally divided into 3 flasks and subcultured. Upon cellular confluency, the LF cells were treated with TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, or none (as a control) and incubated for 48 hours. The conditioned media were collected and assayed for MMP-2 and MMP-9 using gelatin zymography and Western blot analysis. The electrophoresis bands were compared on densitometric scans using ImageJ software. RESULTS The conditioned media from the isolated human LF cells naturally expressed 72-kD and 92-kD gelatinolytic activities on gelatin zymography. The IL-1\u03b2-treated LF cells presented sustained increases in the proenzyme\/zymogen forms of MMP-2 and -9 (proMMP-2 and proMMP-9), and activeMMP-9 expression (p = 0.001, 0.022, and 0.036, respectively); the TNF\u03b1-treated LF cells showed the most elevated proMMP9 secretion (p = 0.006), as determined by Western blot analyses. ActiveMMP-2 expression was not observed on zymography or the Western blot analysis. CONCLUSIONS TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 promote proMMP-2 and proMMP-9 secretion. IL-1\u03b2 appears to activate proMMP-9 in human LF cells. Based on these findings, selective MMP-9 blockers or antiinflammatory drugs could be potential treatment options for LF hypertrophy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d9a","authors":["Kim, Bum-Joon","Hur, Junseok W","Park, Jong Soo","Kim, Joo Han","Kwon, Taek-Hyun","Park, Youn-Kwan","Moon, Hong Joo"],"doi":"10.3171\/2015.6.spine141271","first_seen_on":"2015-11-14T12:20:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1547-5646"],"journal":"Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine","last_mentioned_on":1447508922,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26565765?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26565765?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26565765","pubdate":"2015-11-14T22:01:06+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurosurgery"],"title":"Expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 in human ligamentum flavum cells treated with tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-1\u03b2.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expression-matrix-metalloproteinase2-9-human-ligamentum-flavum-cells-treated-tumor-necrosis-factor%CE%B1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6566187,"mean":6.0857394292517,"rank":4856775,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":964941,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6566187,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208298,"mean":10.101526752666,"rank":142851,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":42435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208298,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":687,"mean":3.3715247813411,"rank":350,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":268,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":687,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72,"mean":1.3535211267606,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Neuroscience":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Strep_papers\/statuses\/665495031243915264","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4761657],"posted_on":"2015-11-14T11:42:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Strep_papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513367728158044160\/4aRFryWr_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot of #Streptomyces papers in #Pubmed\r\ncreated and curated by @paulhoskisson","id_on_source":"Strep_papers","tweeter_id":"2822299628","geo":{"lt":55.86515,"ln":-4.25763,"country":"GB"},"followers":321},"tweet_id":"665495031243915264"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/665526773837201409","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4761657],"posted_on":"2015-11-14T13:48:42+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":965},"tweet_id":"665526773837201409"}]}}
