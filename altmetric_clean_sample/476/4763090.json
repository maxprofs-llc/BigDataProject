While X-ray PDF analysis is discussed, the focus is on neutron diffraction results because of the greater extent of the data and the sensitivity of the neutron to oxygen atoms, the behaviour of which is important in PZN. The PDF was shown to be sensitive to many effects not apparent in the average crystal structure, including variations in the B-site-O separation distances and the fact that \u3008110\u3009 Pb(2+) displacements are most likely. A qualitative comparison between SCDS and the PDF shows that some features apparent in SCDS were not apparent in the PDF. These tended to pertain to short-range correlations in the structure, rather than to interatomic separations. For example, in SCDS the short-range alternation of the B-site cations was quite apparent in diffuse scattering at (\u00bd \u00bd \u00bd), whereas it was not apparent in the PDF.","altmetric_jid":"56b367f42a83eea9718b45b9","authors":["Whitfield, R.E.","Goossens, D.J.","Welberry, T.R.","Whitfield, Ross E","Goossens, Darren J","Welberry, T
