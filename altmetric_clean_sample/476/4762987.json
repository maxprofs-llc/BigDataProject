This together with the higher sun protection factor and the differences in the quality of the skin and soft tissue create a profound effect on their aging process. Understanding of these differences and their effects in the aging process in Asians is crucial in determining effective utilization and placement of injectable products to ensure optimal aesthetic outcomes.\nFor younger Asian women, the main treatment goal is to address the inherent structural deficits through reshaping and the provision of facial support. Facial injectables are used to provide anterior projection, to reduce facial width, and to lengthen facial height. In the older group, the aim is for rejuvenation and also to address the underlying structural issues that has compounded due to age-related volume loss.\nAsian women requesting cosmetic procedures do not want to be Westernized but rather seeking to enhance and optimize their Asian ethnic features.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f61000854c","authors":["Liew, Steven"],"doi":"10.1097\/prs.0000000000001728","first_seen_on":"2015-11-14T23:33:03+00:00","issns":["1529-4242","0032-1052"],"issue":"5S","journal":"Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1447543628,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/plasreconsurg\/Fulltext\/2015\/11001\/Ethnic_and_Gender_Considerations_in_the_Use_of.5.aspx?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/plasreconsurg\/2015\/11001\/Ethnic_and_Gender_Considerations_in_the_Use_of.5.pdf","pmid":"26441103","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"22S","subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Ethnic and Gender Considerations in the Use of Facial Injectables: Asian Patients","type":"article","volume":"136","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/facial-injectables-asian-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6566187,"mean":6.0857394292517,"rank":5601261,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6566187,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208298,"mean":10.101501308228,"rank":165864,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208298,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4177,"mean":6.1359521072797,"rank":3353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4177,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150,"mean":10.449234899329,"rank":114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
