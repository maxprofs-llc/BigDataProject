Diagnostic reference levels of the volumetric computed tomography dose index (CTDIvol) are available for dedicated CT procedures of selected body regions but similar reference levels for whole-body CT employed in PET\/CT exams are limited. This work reports CTDIvol values from sites that conduct whole-body oncology PET\/CT exams and participated in the SNMMI CTN scanner validation program.\nFrom 2010 to 2014, a total of 154 sites submitted CT acquisition parameters used in their clinical [(18)F]FDG PET\/CT oncology protocols. From these parameters, the CTDIvol was estimated using the ImPACT CTDI dosimetry tables. Histograms of CTDIvol values were created for each year and descriptive statistics, including mean, median and 75th percentile were reported. A repeated measures ANOVA was performed to determine whether significant differences occurred between reporting years.\nA wide range of technical parameters were reported, most notably in tube current. The median CTDIvol ranged from 4.9 to 6.2 mGy and 75th percentile from 9.7 to 10.0 mGy between 2010 and 2014, respectively. There was no significant change in CTDIvol between reporting years (RM-ANOVA, P = 0.985).\nThe 75th percentile CTDIvol reported in this work was 9.8 mGy averaged over all reporting years. These data provide a resource for establishing CTDIvol reference values specific to performing computed tomography in PET\/CT whole-body examinations. The wide ranges of CT acquisition parameters reported by sites suggest that CTDIvol reference levels may be beneficial for optimization of CT protocols.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007da6","authors":["Jallow, Ngoneh","Christian, Paul E","Sunderland, John","Graham, Michael M","Hoffman, John M","Nye, Jonathon A"],"doi":"10.2967\/jnumed.115.160465","first_seen_on":"2015-11-14T11:58:26+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1535-5667","2159-662X","0161-5505"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Nuclear Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1466141043,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26564326?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26564326?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/jnm.snmjournals.org\/content\/57\/2\/238"],"pmid":"26564326","pubdate":"2015-11-14T22:02:55+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"Diagnostic Reference Levels of CT Radiation Dose in Whole-Body PET\/CT","type":"article","volume":"57","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diagnostic-reference-levels-ct-radiation-dose-wholebody-petct"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7909849,"mean":6.6937446400934,"rank":3266262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4593493,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7909849,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240886,"mean":9.4979608277808,"rank":85005,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":153276,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240886,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2132,"mean":4.3055551384327,"rank":655,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":1456,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2132,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":4.9961111111111,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Physics and Astronomy":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/petctimaging\/statuses\/665488358722809856","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4761466],"posted_on":"2015-11-14T11:16:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Tom","url":"http:\/\/www.usmolecular.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2411402290\/ms2zbkt4yzm2bbe4j7vi_normal.jpeg","description":"PET\/CT imaging.","id_on_source":"petctimaging","tweeter_id":"228235116","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2888},"tweet_id":"665488358722809856"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/molecularimging\/statuses\/665494256270843904","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4761466],"posted_on":"2015-11-14T11:39:29+00:00","author":{"name":"Molecular Imaging","url":"http:\/\/www.medjournal.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1081930767\/fdg_normal.PNG","description":"PET\/CT, MRI, CT, and other molecular imaging news and updates.
