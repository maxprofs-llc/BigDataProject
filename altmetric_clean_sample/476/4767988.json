The veridical or telepathic hallucination was one of these objects, constituting a field both of division and exchange between nascent psychology and disciplines known as 'psychic sciences' in France, and 'psychical research' in the Anglo-American context. In France, Leon Marillier (1862-1901) was the main protagonist in discussions concerning the concept of the veridical hallucination, which gave rise to criticisms by mental specialists and psychopathologists. After all, not only were these hallucinations supposed to occur in healthy subjects, but they also failed to correspond to the Esquirolian definition of hallucinations through being corroborated by their representation of external, objective events.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4dd3cf058f610001bf1","authors":["Pascal Le Mal\u00e9fan","Andreas Sommer","Le Mal\u00e9fan, Pascal","Sommer, Andreas"],"doi":"10.1177\/0957154x14562756","endpage":"432","first_seen_on":"2015-11-16T18:28:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1740-2360","0957-154X"],"issue":"4","journal":"History of Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1448106108,"links":["http:\/\/hpy.sagepub.com\/content\/26\/4\/418.abstract?rss=1","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26574058?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/hpy.sagepub.com\/content\/26\/4\/418.full.pdf","pmid":"26574058","pubdate":"2015-11-18T22:00:55+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Literary Studies","scheme":"era"},{"name":"History And Philosophy Of Specific Fields","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"418","title":"L\u00e9on Marillier and the veridical hallucination in late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century French psychology and psychopathology.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/10.1177\/0957154X14562756","volume":"26"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6589635,"mean":6.1154988547167,"rank":2270696,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4269420,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6589635,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193228,"mean":10.264972824709,"rank":68031,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":123499,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193228,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":364,"mean":3.0731625344353,"rank":163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":201,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":364,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.125,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"MX":1,"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ThihaSwe_dr\/statuses\/666321942153183232","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4767988],"posted_on":"2015-11-16T18:28:25+00:00","author":{"name":"Psychiatry Updates","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/PsychiatryUpdates.by.DrThihaSwe","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3471096253\/6b7bd3fc313986902cd1574474364bae_normal.jpeg","description":"[RSS Updates from Psychiatry Journals globally, plus some mental health related news] \/ Should follow only if you are interested in Mental Health","id_on_source":"ThihaSwe_dr","tweeter_id":"1259166031","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":975},"tweet_id":"666321942153183232"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Neuro_Skeptic\/statuses\/667346803587723264","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4767988],"posted_on":"2015-11-19T14:20:51+00:00","author":{"name":"Neuroskeptic","url":"http:\/\/blogs.discovermagazine.com\/neuroskeptic\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/703637604181393409\/iCflIKVK_normal.jpg","description":"Neuroscience, psychology and psychiatry through a skeptical lens.
