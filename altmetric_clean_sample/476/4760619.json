However, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here we show that LGX818 potently decreased ERK phosphorylation and inhibited proliferation in BRAFV600E melanoma cell lines. Moreover, LGX818 downregulated CyclinD1 in a glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2-independent manner and induced cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, Surprisingly, LGX818 triggered cellular senescence in BRAFV600E melanoma cells, as evidenced by increased \u03b2-galactosidase staining, while no appreciable induction of apoptosis was detected, as determined by Annexin V and propidium iodide staining and immunoblot analysis of caspase-3 processing and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Increased p27KIP1 expression and retinoblastoma protein activation was detected during LGX818-induced senescence. Additionally, inhibition of dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1B by AZ191 reversed LGX818-induced CyclinD1 turnover and senescence. Interestingly, autophagy is triggered through inhibition of the mTOR\/70S6K pathway during LGX818-induced senescence. Moreover, autophagy inhibition by pharmacological and genetic regulation attenuates LGX818-induced senescence. Notably, combining LGX818 with autophagy modulators have anti-proliferative effect in LGX818-resistant BRAF mutant melanoma cells. Altogether, we uncovered a mechanism by which LGX818 exerts its anti-tumor activity in BRAFV600E melanoma cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000249e","authors":["Li, Zhen","Jiang, Ke","Zhu, Xiaofang","Lin, Guibin","Song, Fei","Zhao, Yongfu","Piao, Yongjun","Liu, Jiwei","Cheng, Wei","Bi, Xiaolin","Gong, Peng","Song, Zhiqi","Meng, Songshu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.canlet.2015.11.015","first_seen_on":"2015-11-14T03:52:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0304-3835","1872-7980","03043835"],"journal":"Cancer Letters","last_mentioned_on":1462356307,"links":["http:\/\/www.cancerletters.info\/article\/S0304-3835(15)00689-8\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.cancerletters.info\/article\/S0304-3835(15)00689-8\/abstract?rss=yes","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26586345?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0304383515006898&_version=1&md5=d49ca6853678128b3935a5b2786a9f9f","http:\/\/www.cancerletters.info\/article\/S0304-3835(15)00689-8\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cancerletters.info\/article\/S0304383515006898\/pdf","pmid":"26586345","pubdate":"2015-11-21T11:13:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Encorafenib (LGX818), a potent BRAF inhibitor, induces senescence accompanied by autophagy in BRAFV600E melanoma cells","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/encorafenib-lgx818-potent-braf-inhibitor-induces-senescence-accompanied-autophagy-brafv600e-melanoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7651252,"mean":6.5763358914726,"rank":3504642,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":3973898,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7651252,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239785,"mean":9.4513828362192,"rank":102565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":128526,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239785,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1799,"mean":3.2784905450501,"rank":810,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":939,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1799,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":3.0438648648649,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
