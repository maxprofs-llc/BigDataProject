Gene expression profiling has been used extensively to investigate the regulation processes of grapevine-P. viticola interaction, but all studies to date have involved the use of whole leaves. However, only a small fraction of host cells is in contact with the pathogen, so highly localized transcriptional changes of infected cells may be masked by the large portion of non-infected cells when analyzing the whole leaf. In order to understand the transcriptional regulation of the plant reaction at the sites of pathogen infection, we optimized a laser microdissection protocol and analyzed the transcriptional changes in stomata cells and surrounding areas of grapevine leaves at early stages of P. viticola infection. The results indicate that the expression levels of seven P. viticola responsive genes were greater in microdissected cells than in whole leaves, highlighting the site-specific transcriptional regulation of the host response. The gene modulation was restricted to the stomata cells and to the surrounding areas of infected tissues, indicating that the host response is mainly located at the infection sites and that short-distance signals are implicated. In addition, thanks to the high sensitivity of the laser microdissection technique, significant modulations of three genes that were completely masked in the whole tissue analysis were detected. The protocol validated in this study could greatly increase the sensitivity of further transcriptomic studies of the grapevine-P. viticola interaction.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003330","authors":["Lenzi, Luisa","Caruso, Carla","Bianchedi, Per Luigi","Pertot, Ilaria","Perazzolli, Michele"],"doi":"10.1093\/pcp\/pcv166","first_seen_on":"2015-11-16T16:09:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-9053"],"journal":"Plant & Cell Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1447686511,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26546320?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26546320","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","botany"],"title":"Laser microdissection of grapevine leaves reveals site-specific regulation of transcriptional response to Plasmopara viticola.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/laser-microdissection-grapevine-leaves-reveals-sitespecific-regulation-transcriptional-response-plas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6574363,"mean":6.0951058539218,"rank":4863260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":966225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6574363,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193050,"mean":10.264896249139,"rank":132727,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":39349,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193050,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":639,"mean":2.3958056426332,"rank":412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":157,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":639,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":2.1071428571429,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
