Asbestos fibers have been identified too, and more than 100,000 fibers per gram of dry weight were detected in subjects with occupational exposure; this concentration is internationally accepted as suggesting high probability of past occupational exposure to asbestos.Instead, when the ABs burden is low or moderate (such as in subjects with absent or probable asbestos exposure), the correlation between ABs concentration determined by OM and those determined by SEM is lost. Therefore, when the ABs value in OM is borderline, the SEM investigation became essential. Furthermore, the mineralogical analysis by SEM-EDS (identification and quantification of inorganic fibers in general and asbestos in particular) of the fibers detected in the lung tissues is very useful, if not necessary, to complete the pathological diagnosis of asbestos-related malignancies in medicolegal field.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f610006975","authors":["Capella, Silvana","Bellis, Donata","Belluso, Elena"],"doi":"10.1097\/paf.0000000000000206","first_seen_on":"2015-11-14T11:45:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0195-7910","1533-404X"],"journal":"The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1447499004,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/amjforensicmedicine\/9000\/00000\/Diagnosis_of_Asbestos_Related_Diseases__The.99413.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/amjforensicmedicine\/9000\/00000\/Diagnosis_of_Asbestos_Related_Diseases__The.99413.pdf","pmid":"26566053","pubdate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology","jurisprudence"],"title":"Diagnosis of Asbestos-Related Diseases: The Mineralogist and Pathologist's Role in Medicolegal Field.","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diagnosis-asbestosrelated-diseases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6566187,"mean":6.0857394292517,"rank":4856766,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":964949,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6566187,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208298,"mean":10.101520991661,"rank":142847,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":42440,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208298,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":525,"mean":3.0203625954198,"rank":366,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":525,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":2.0271666666667,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/amjforensicmed\/statuses\/665485175560671232","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4761291],"posted_on":"2015-11-14T11:03:24+00:00","author":{"name":"AMJ ForensicMedicine","url":"http:\/\/www.amjforensicmedicine.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1464487726\/ajfmp_normal.jpg","description":"The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology presents up-to-date coverage of forensic medical practices worldwide.","id_on_source":"amjforensicmed","tweeter_id":"334230697","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":328},"tweet_id":"665485175560671232"}]}}
