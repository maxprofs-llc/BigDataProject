The number of cells was lower than that in typical anoxic habitats. Spores did not always dominate the population of sulfate-reducing bacteria. In all soils, the methanogenic population displayed a long lag phase after anoxic conditions were imposed before methane production began.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022c6","authors":["Peters, V","Conrad, R"],"first_seen_on":"2015-11-15T00:35:40+00:00","issns":["0099-2240"],"issue":"4","journal":"Applied & Environmental Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1447547576,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16535011","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1388429"],"pmcid":"PMC1388429","pmid":"16535011","pubdate":"1995-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Methanogenic and Other Strictly Anaerobic Bacteria in Desert Soil and Other Oxic Soils","type":"article","volume":"61","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/methanogenic-other-strictly-anaerobic-bacteria-desert-soil-other-oxic-soils"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6569769,"mean":6.0903787716706,"rank":1519410,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":4413489,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6569769,"percentile":67},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208010,"mean":10.065754606772,"rank":64607,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":140472,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208010,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4756,"mean":6.0346166140904,"rank":1214,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":2641,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4756,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148,"mean":7.3815102040816,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":20,"Student  > Ph.
