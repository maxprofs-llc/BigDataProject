Of particular concern, A. baumannii strains exhibiting resistance to carbapenems, which were previously considered the treatment of choice for infected patients, have dramatically increased worldwide, leaving a few antibacterial choices. Tigecycline, a broad-spectrum modified minocycline derivative, isconsidered as a last resort drug against multidrug-resistant A. baumannii. Though, resistance to tigecycline has emerged and is growing notably following increasing tigecycline usage. Comparative evaluation of the tigecycline resistance rates reported worldwide is challenging due to the absence of official interpretative criteria for in vitro susceptibility testing and the discrepancies among the different susceptibility methodologies used, with broth microdilution being considered the reference method. Tigecycline resistance is mainly associated with resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND)-type transporters, mainly the AdeABC, AdeFGH and AdeIJK efflux pumps, but other resistance mechanisms have also been implicated. Tigecycline is still an attractive choice for A. baumannii , but further investigations are warranted so that treatment of MDR \u0391. baumannii could be guided by validated in vitro data.","aggregated_in":[15113424],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9283cf058f61000dd24","authors":["Pournaras, Spyros","Koumaki, Vasiliki","Gennimata, Vasiliki","Kouskouni, Evangelia","Tsakris, Athanassios","Spyros Pournaras","Vasiliki Koumaki","Vasiliki Gennimata","Evangelia Kouskouni","Athanassios Tsakris"],"book":{"isbns":["9783319263199","9783319263205"],"uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/book\/10.1007%2F978-3-319-26320-5","title":"Advances in Microbiology, Infectious Diseases and Public Health"},"doi":"10.1007\/5584_2015_5001","first_seen_on":"2015-11-16T07:49:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0065-2598","2214-8019"],"journal":"Advances in experimental medicine and biology","last_mentioned_on":1471604944,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26563303?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/chapter\/10.1007\/5584_2015_5001"],"ordinal_number":5001,"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2F5584_2015_5001.pdf","pmid":"26563303","pubdate":"2015-11-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"series":{"title":"Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology","issn":"0065-2598"},"subjects":["medicine","biology"],"title":"In Vitro Activity of Tigecycline Against Acinetobacter baumannii: Global Epidemiology and Resistance Mechanisms","type":"chapter","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/chapter\/10.1007%2F5584_2015_5001","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vitro-activity-tigecycline-against-acinetobacter-baumannii-global-epidemiology-resistance-mechanisms"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8247986,"mean":6.9694821610306,"rank":3420811,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4782450,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8247986,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":226419,"mean":9.7463118744976,"rank":78506,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":146190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":226419,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2410,"mean":3.518096305521,"rank":769,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":1633,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2410,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":5.2525263157895,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
