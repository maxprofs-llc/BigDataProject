We describe complications associated with vascular chronic Q fever as found in the largest cohort of chronic Q fever patients so far.\nPatients with proven or probable chronic Q fever with a focus of infection in an aortic aneurysm or vascular graft were included in this study, using the Dutch national chronic Q fever database.\nA total of 122 patients were diagnosed with vascular chronic Q fever between April 2008 and June 2012. The infection affected a vascular graft in 62 patients (50.8%) and an aneurysm in 53 patients (43.7%). Seven patients (5.7%) had a different vascular focus. Thirty-six patients (29.5%) presented with acute complications, and 35 of these patients (97.2%) underwent surgery. Following diagnosis and start of antibiotic treatment, 26 patients (21.3%) presented with a variety of complications requiring surgical treatment during a mean follow-up of 14.1\u00a0\u00b1 9.1\u00a0months. The overall mortality rate was 23.7%. Among these patients, mortality was associated with chronic Q fever in 18 patients (62.1%).\nThe management of vascular infections with C.\u00a0burnetii tends to be complicated. Diagnosis is often difficult due to asymptomatic presentation. Patients undergo challenging surgical corrections and long-term antibiotic treatment. Complication rates and mortality are high in this patient cohort.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f17","authors":["Broos, Pieter P H L","Hagenaars, Julia C J P","Kampschreur, Linda M","Wever, Peter C","Bleeker-Rovers, Chantal P","Koning, Olivier H J","Teijink, Joep A W","Wegdam-Blans, Marjolijn C A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jvs.2015.06.217","first_seen_on":"2015-11-14T14:44:03+00:00","issns":["1097-6809","0741-5214"],"journal":"Journal of Vascular Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1447056125,"links":["http:\/\/www.jvascsurg.org\/article\/S0741-5214(15)01484-6\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jvascsurg.org\/article\/S0741521415014846\/pdf","pmid":"26365665","pubdate":"2015-01-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Vascular complications and surgical interventions after world's largest Q fever outbreak","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vascular-complications-surgical-interventions-after-worlds-largest-q-fever-outbreak"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6549866,"mean":6.0697548813592,"rank":5588171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6549866,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208075,"mean":10.105101963725,"rank":165642,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208075,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1448,"mean":3.0045874222529,"rank":1085,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1448,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":1.1763157894737,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
