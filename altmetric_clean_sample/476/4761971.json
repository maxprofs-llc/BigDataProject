In this work, we investigated in these patients, the Default Mode Network and Somatomotor connectivity changes at rest longitudinally, in the subacute and late phase after brain injury. The aim of the study is to characterize such connectivity patterns and relate the observed changes to clinical and neuropsychological outcomes of these patients after a period of intensive neuro-rehabilitation. Our findings show within the Default Mode Network a disruption of connectivity of medial prefrontal regions and a significant change of amplitude of internal connections. Notably, strongest changes in functional connectivity significantly correlated to consistent clinical and cognitive recovery. This evidence seems to indicate that the re-organization of the Default mode network may represent a valid biomarker for the cognitive recovery in severe acquired brain injury patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e7b","authors":["Falletta Caravasso, Chiara","de Pasquale, Francesco","Ciurli, Paola","Catani, Sheila","Formisano, Rita","Sabatini, Umberto","Falletta CaravassoChiara","de PasqualeFrancesco","CiurliPaola","CataniSheila","FormisanoRita","SabatiniUmberto"],"doi":"10.1089\/neu.2015.4003","first_seen_on":"2015-11-14T13:38:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1557-9042","0897-7151"],"journal":"Journal of Neurotrauma","last_mentioned_on":1447507747,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26559732\/","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1089\/neu.2015.4003"],"pmid":"26559732","pubdate":"2015-11-14T22:08:48+00:00","publisher":" Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.  140 Huguenot Street, 3rd Floor New Rochelle, NY 10801 USA  ","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"The Default Mode Network connectivity predicts cognitive recovery in severe acquired brain injured patients: a longitudinal study.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/default-mode-network-connectivity-predicts-cognitive-recovery-severe-acquired-brain-injured-patients-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6566187,"mean":6.0857394292517,"rank":4856775,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":964943,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6566187,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208298,"mean":10.101528913043,"rank":142850,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":42436,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208298,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":834,"mean":7.2551332533013,"rank":592,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":130,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":834,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":5.2776666666667,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
