Healthy adult dogs were prepared with a tracheostomy and with implanted electroencephalographic and nuchal electromyographic recording electrodes. A silent occlusion valve was attached to the outer end of the endotracheal tube. The electroencephalogram and electromyogram were monitored continuously by a computer that determined sleep-wake state using software developed in our laboratory. At a predetermined time (e.g., 12 s) after each sleep onset, a signal was transmitted from the computer to the valve controller, resulting in airway occlusion. When the dog aroused from sleep, the occlusion was released. These events therefore mimic those that occur in human OSA. Successful operation of the model was confirmed during 5-day continuous trials in two dogs. During the trials, the dogs became increasingly somnolent both by behavioral observation and objective measurement. The frequency of occlusions increased, and measures of apnea severity, including apnea duration and end-apneic arterial oxygen saturation, worsened. We conclude that this experimental model of repeated airway occlusion during sleep provides a potentially powerful tool for investigating the sequelae of OSA.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b71","authors":["Kimoff, R J","Makino, H","Horner, R L","Kozar, L F","Lue, F","Slutsky, A S","Phillipson, E A"],"first_seen_on":"2015-11-15T07:08:04+00:00","issns":["8750-7587"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Applied Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1447571266,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8045863"],"pmid":"8045863","pubdate":"1994-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Canine model of obstructive sleep apnea: model description and preliminary application.","type":"article","volume":"76","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/canine-model-obstructive-sleep-apnea-model-description-preliminary-application-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6569769,"mean":6.0903787716706,"rank":2542020,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3949202,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6569769,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208010,"mean":10.065746434049,"rank":84985,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":120054,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208010,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3054,"mean":9.0008955126105,"rank":1666,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":1355,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3054,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":11.386911764706,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Neuroscience":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/meangrape\/statuses\/665788196291153920","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4763467],"posted_on":"2015-11-15T07:07:30+00:00","author":{"name":"Jay.","url":"https:\/\/goodreads.com\/meangrape","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/910994212010774528\/zoqPfP9N_normal.jpg","description":"bellum se ipsum alet. @Sentenai @HarvardLIL @OFA.
