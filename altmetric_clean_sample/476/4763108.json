In the crystal, neighbouring mol-ecules are linked into centrosymmetric R 2 (2)(8) dimers by pairs of N-H\u22efO inter-actions and into a three-dimensional network by C-H\u22ef\u03c0 inter-actions. The dimers are arranged into layers parallel to (010).","authors":["Akkurt, M.","Akkurt, M.","Jasinski, J.P.","Mohamed, S.K.","El-Emary, T.I.","Albayati, M.R."],"doi":"10.1107\/s2056989015020770","first_seen_on":"2015-11-15T01:01:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2056-9890"],"issue":"Pt 12","journal":"Acta Crystallographica Section E: Crystallographic Communications","last_mentioned_on":1447549208,"links":["http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?S2056989015020770"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.iucr.org\/e\/issues\/2015\/12\/00\/qm2112\/qm2112.pdf","pmid":"26870537","pubdate":"2015-11-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"International Union of Crystallography","title":"Crystal structure of 3-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)-N\u2032-[(E)-4-chloro\u00adbenzyl\u00adidene]propano\u00adhydrazide","type":"article","volume":"71","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/crystal-structure-39-ihi-carbazol9yl-ini-iei-4chlorobenzylidenepropanohydrazide"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ActaCrystE\/statuses\/665695746830770176","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4763108],"posted_on":"2015-11-15T01:00:08+00:00","author":{"id_on_source":"ActaCrystE","tweeter_id":"587565184","geo":{"lt":53.1905,"ln":-2.89189,"country":"GB"}},"tweet_id":"665695746830770176"}]}}
