Measurements of the incoherent decay rate as a function of flux bias revealed a Gaussian-shaped profile that is not peaked at the resonance point but is shifted to a bias at which the initial well is higher than the target well. The rms amplitude of the noise, which is proportional to the dephasing rate 1\/tauphi, was observed to be weakly dependent on temperature below 70 mK. Analysis of these results indicates that the dominant source of low energy flux noise in this device is a quantum mechanical environment in thermal equilibrium.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2008PhRvL.101k7003H","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008519","arxiv_id":"0712.0838","authors":["R.
