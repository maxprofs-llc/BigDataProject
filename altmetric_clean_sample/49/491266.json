This article highlights some of the emerging applications of photodegradable polymers in the form of homopolymers, particles and self-assembled constructs in solution, hydrogels for tissue engineering, and photolabile polymers for biopatterning applications. Novel photochemistries have been combined with controlled polymerization methods, which result in well-defined photodegradable materials that exhibit light mediated and often controlled fragmentation processes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f610008096","authors":["Pasparakis, George","Manouras, Theodore","Argitis, Panagiotis","Vamvakaki, Maria"],"doi":"10.1002\/marc.201100637","endpage":"198","first_seen_on":"2011-12-13T15:17:20+00:00","issns":["1521-3927","1022-1336"],"issue":"3","journal":"Macromolecular Rapid Communications","last_mentioned_on":1346336797,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/marc.201100637","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/marc.201100637\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/marc.201100637\/pdf","pmid":"22162153","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u00e2\u0080\u0090VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"startpage":"183","subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Photodegradable Polymers for Biotechnological Applications","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/photodegradable-polymers-biotechnological-applications"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630978,"mean":4.9279868812221,"rank":2741144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":731977,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630978,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229155,"mean":3.9046881049428,"rank":145456,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":65173,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229155,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1010,"mean":1.4083845391477,"rank":212,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":637,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1010,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244,"mean":1.2404526748971,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
