Which are endogeneous cellular short RNA molecules found in the cytoplasm as well as in various serum fluids. miRNAs are transcriptional and translational regulatory molecules active in cell division, growth, and apoptosis (1). Dysregulated expression of miRNAs has been implicated in various disease states and has been tested as biomarker candidates (2-4). miRNAs are endogeneous cellular short RNA molecules found in the cytoplasm as well as in various serum fluids. miRNAs are transcriptional and translational regulatory molecules active in cell division, growth, and apoptosis (Bartel, Cell 116:281-97, 2004). Dysregulated expression of miRNAs has been implicated in various disease states and has been tested as biomarker candidates (He et al., Nature 435:828-833, 2005; Lu et al., Nature 435:834-838, 2005; O'Donnell, et al., Nature 435:839-843, 2005). In this chapter, we describe the methods using \u03bcParaflo(\u00ae) microfluidic oligonucleotide microarray technology for applications in miRNA profiling. One unique feature of this technology is the flexibility that provides users with the freedom to select sequence content either for focused studies wherein only the most relevant sequences are included or for discovery studies wherein the most updated sequence content such as those newly derived from deep sequencing. This chapter provides detailed information from experimental design to sample preparation, as well as data analysis for a miRNA array experiment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd3b","authors":["Zhou X","Zhu Q","Eicken C","Sheng N","Zhang X","Yang L","Gao X"],"doi":"10.1007\/978-1-61779-427-8_11","first_seen_on":"2011-12-14T08:46:29+00:00","funders":["nci","nigms"],"issns":["1940-6029","1064-3745"],"journal":"Methods in molecular biology","last_mentioned_on":1323851639,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22144198?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22144198","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"MicroRNA Profiling Using \u00b5Paraflo Microfluidic Array Technology.","type":"article","volume":"822","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microrna-profiling-using-paraflo-microfluidic-array-technology"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506214,"mean":5.1186469373082,"rank":3107956,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":993795,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506214,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232857,"mean":4.1823101659397,"rank":146045,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":55738,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232857,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3194,"mean":1.3520050109615,"rank":1457,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":1377,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3194,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269,"mean":1.3365447761194,"rank":102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":129,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
