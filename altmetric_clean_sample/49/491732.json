Diagnosis of the disease is generally based on clinical and radiological findings. Evaluation of pulmonary disorders by flexible bronchoscopy (FOB) is a rapidly developing facility, but diagnostic and therapeutic FOB for pulmonary hydatid cysts is still controversial. This study examines the findings of endobronchial hydatid cyst disease in five pediatric patients from Turkey, and clinical experience about this subject is reviewed. All our patients presented with unusual symptoms of the disease, and for all of them, diagnosis had been delayed using current diagnostic methods. As a result of our experience, it can be reported that the endobronchial appearance of the hydatid cyst membrane is whitish-yellow, and it is difficult to differentiate it radiologically from some other common causes of endobronchial lesions in childhood, such as endobronchial tuberculosis, foreign body aspirations, mucous plaques, and granulation scars. The findings of these cases show that, hydatid cyst should also be kept in mind in differential diagnosis of endobronchial lesions. In the diagnosis of pulmonary hydatid cyst in children without typical clinical and radiological findings of the disease, FOB examination is a valuable diagnostic procedure.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f61000848a","authors":["Kut, Arif","Cakir, Erkan","Midyat, Levent","Cakir, Fatma Betul","Ozaydin, Erhan"],"doi":"10.1002\/ppul.21615","endpage":"709","first_seen_on":"2011-12-13T21:53:05+00:00","issns":["1099-0496","8755-6863"],"issue":"7","journal":"Pediatric Pulmonology","last_mentioned_on":1350986764,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/ppul.21615"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ppul.21615\/pdf","pmid":"22170874","pubdate":"2011-12-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"706","subjects":["pediatrics","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Endobronchial findings of hydatid cyst disease: A report of five pediatric cases","type":"article","volume":"47","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/endobronchial-findings-hydatid-cyst-disease-report-five-pediatric-cases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506977,"mean":5.1265981649798,"rank":3538128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":135757,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506977,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232631,"mean":4.2127634870828,"rank":182605,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1133,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232631,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":999,"mean":1.9128957915832,"rank":774,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":999,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90,"mean":2.1207191011236,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
