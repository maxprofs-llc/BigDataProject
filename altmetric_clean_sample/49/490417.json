These infections may present with devastating complications such as airway obstruction, jugular septic thrombophlebitis, lung abscess, upper airway abscess rupture with asphyxiation, mediastinitis, pericarditis, and septic shock. A thorough understanding of the anatomy and microbiology of these infections is essential for proper management of these patients. Retropharyngeal, danger, prevertebral, lateral pharyngeal, and submandibular space infections and their site-specific clinical manifestations, complications, and therapeutic interventions are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4fe3cf058f610003038","doi":"10.1007\/s00408-009-9153-7","first_seen_on":"2011-12-13T00:38:58+00:00","issns":["1432-1750"],"issue":"5","journal":"Lung","last_mentioned_on":1323734400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19653038","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s00408-009-9153-7"],"pmid":"19653038","pubdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Severe soft tissue infections of the head and neck: a primer for critical care physicians.","type":"article","volume":"187","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/severe-soft-tissue-infections-head-neck-primer-critical-care-physicians"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629591,"mean":4.9337473984712,"rank":234206,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":3389675,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629591,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229147,"mean":3.9140592111582,"rank":14155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":214749,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229147,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168,"mean":1.7761317365269,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":165,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.1730769230769,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
