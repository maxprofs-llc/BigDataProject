Thirty participants made forward (approach) or backward (avoidance) steps on a forceplate in response to the valence of visual stimuli. Posturographic parameters of the steps, related to automatic stimulus evaluation, step initiation and step execution, were determined and analyzed as a function of stimulus valence and stimulus-response mapping. The results revealed marked effects of emotion on the step parameters of interest; unpleasant images caused an initial \"freezing\" response, and a tendency to move away from the stimuli. Pleasant stimuli, in contrast, were not found to induce approach tendencies. The results demonstrated that affect, especially negative emotions, and whole-body movements such as voluntary stepping are coupled.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002928","doi":"10.1016\/j.gaitpost.2011.04.002","first_seen_on":"2011-12-14T15:07:38+00:00","issns":["1879-2219"],"issue":"2","journal":"Gait & Posture","last_mentioned_on":1323874411,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21549605"],"pmid":"21549605","pubdate":"2011-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mechanical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Organization of voluntary stepping in response to emotion-inducing pictures.","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/organization-voluntary-stepping-response-emotioninducing-pictures"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505992,"mean":5.1115236646191,"rank":1993844,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2420391,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505992,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232853,"mean":4.1675099977671,"rank":78483,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":147733,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232853,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":727,"mean":2.5235068870523,"rank":296,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":402,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":727,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":5.747,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
