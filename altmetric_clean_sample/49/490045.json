In vivo, a wound model was established through the panniculus carnosus of BALB\/c mice, and then inoculated with 5 \u00d7 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU) of Staphylococcus aureus or Enterococcus faecalis. For each bacterial strain, the study included an infected or non-infected group that did not receive any treatment, three groups singly treated with tigecycline, rifampin, and daptomycin, and two groups that received tigecycline treatment plus rifampin or daptomycin. In the in vitro studies, tigecycline, daptomycin, and teicoplanin were active against all of the 48 Gram-positive isolates. The combination of tigecycline with rifampicin and daptomycin was synergistic against S. aureus and Enterococcus spp. In the in vivo studies, all groups treated with single drugs showed statistically significant results compared to the control group. The two groups treated with a combination of drugs showed the highest antimicrobial efficacy. In conclusion, our results suggested a strong activity of tigecycline alone and in combination with other antimicrobial agents against multi-resistant Gram-positive organisms isolated from wound infections.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002828","authors":["C.
