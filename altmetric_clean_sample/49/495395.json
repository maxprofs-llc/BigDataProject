Prior studies demonstrated that acute dietary sodium modulation significantly altered LVH-specific ECG voltage in hypertensive individuals, thus modifying cardiovascular risk prediction; but whether this phenomenon exists in normotensive individuals is not known. We evaluated the influence of dietary sodium intake on ECG voltage and ECG criteria for LVH in normotensive individuals.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cfd","doi":"10.231\/jim.0b013e31823d05ab","first_seen_on":"2011-12-16T08:31:15+00:00","funders":["nhlbi"],"issns":["1081-5589"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Investigative Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1327496210,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jinvestigativemed\/9000\/00000\/Influence_of_Dietary_Sodium_Modulation_on.99803.pdf?utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jinvestigativemed\/Abstract\/2012\/01000\/Influence_of_Dietary_Sodium_Modulation_on.8.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jinvestigativemed\/9000\/00000\/Influence_of_Dietary_Sodium_Modulation_on.99803.pdf","pmid":"22089249","pubdate":"2011-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Influence of Dietary Sodium Modulation on Electrocardiographic Voltage Criteria for Left Ventricular Hypertrophy in Normotensive Individuals","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-dietary-sodium-modulation-electrocardiographic-voltage-criteria-left-ventricular-hypertrop"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5475973,"mean":6.3603619295347,"rank":4555088,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5475973,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238318,"mean":4.6061870533787,"rank":193619,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238318,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":743,"mean":1.1858409703504,"rank":236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":743,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":0.69655172413793,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
