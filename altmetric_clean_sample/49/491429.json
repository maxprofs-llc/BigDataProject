However, many patients cannot receive such treatments, and whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) alone is their only option. The most common WBRT schedule is 30 grays (Gy) in 10 fractions. In this retrospective study, the authors investigated whether these patients benefit from a dose escalation beyond 30 Gy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002494","authors":["Rades, Dirk","Panzner, Annika","Dziggel, Liesa","Haatanen, Tiina","Lohynska, Radka","Schild, Steven E."],"doi":"10.1002\/cncr.26680","endpage":"3859","first_seen_on":"2011-12-13T17:28:23+00:00","issns":["1097-0142","0008-543X"],"issue":"15","journal":"Cancer (0008543X)","last_mentioned_on":1324077251,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cncr.26680\/abstract?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+17+Dec+from+10-13+GMT+for+IT+maintenance.","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/cncr.26680","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cncr.26680\/abstract?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+17+Dec+from+10-13+GMT+for+IT+maintenance"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cncr.26680\/pdf","pmid":"22170514","pubdate":"2011-12-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"3852","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Dose\u00e2\u0080\u0090escalation of whole\u00e2\u0080\u0090brain radiotherapy for brain metastasis in patients with a favorable survival prognosis","type":"article","volume":"118","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/doseescalation-wholebrain-radiotherapy-brain-metastasis-patients-favorable-survival-prognosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505992,"mean":5.1115236646191,"rank":2979008,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1397139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505992,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232624,"mean":4.1663080520845,"rank":137229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":87090,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232624,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3289,"mean":7.2361088807786,"rank":2553,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":645,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3289,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253,"mean":7.0534206349206,"rank":177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":63,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
