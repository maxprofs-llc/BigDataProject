PAIR predicts interactions by a fine-tuned support vector machine model that integrates indirect evidences for interaction, such as gene co-expressions, domain interactions, shared GO annotations, co-localizations, phylogenetic profile similarities and homologous interactions in other organisms (interologs). These predictions were expected to cover 24% of the entire Arabidopsis interactome, and their reliability was estimated to be 44%. Two independent example data sets were used to rigorously validate the prediction accuracy. PAIR features a user-friendly query interface, providing rich annotation on the relationships between two proteins. A graphical interaction network browser has also been integrated into the PAIR web interface to facilitate mining of specific pathways.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f61000832f","doi":"10.1093\/nar\/gkq938","first_seen_on":"2011-12-14T10:54:29+00:00","issns":["1362-4962"],"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","last_mentioned_on":1323859121,"links":["http:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/39\/suppl_1\/D1134.full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/39\/suppl_1\/D1134.full.pdf","pmid":"20952401","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"PAIR: the predicted Arabidopsis interactome resource","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pair-predicted-arabidopsis-interactome-resource"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":2671203,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1694110,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236115,"mean":4.4745047307659,"rank":102662,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":100371,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236115,"percentile":42},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8922,"mean":3.7844524156485,"rank":6162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":1952,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8922,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":752,"mean":3.4605992010652,"rank":383,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":303,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":752,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
