Several attempts have previously been made to resolve this paradox, citing multifunctionality of proteins, alternative splicing, microRNAs or non-coding DNA. As intrinsic protein disorder has been linked with complex responses to environmental stimuli and communication between cells, an additional possibility is that structural disorder may effectively increase the complexity of species.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6ec3cf058f610009ffb","doi":"10.1186\/gb-2011-12-12-r120","first_seen_on":"2011-12-19T11:56:53+00:00","issns":["1465-6906"],"issue":"12","journal":"Genome Biology (Online Edition)","last_mentioned_on":1342229083,"links":["http:\/\/genomebiology.com\/2011\/12\/12\/R120\/abstract","http:\/\/genomebiology.com\/2011\/12\/12\/R120?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/genomebiology.com\/2011\/12\/12\/R120"],"pmid":"22182830","pubdate":"2011-12-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"R120","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"The relationship between proteome size, structural disorder and organism complexity","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/relationship-between-proteome-size-structural-disorder-organism-complexity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":675528,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":4357181,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238093,"mean":4.4644339163016,"rank":29527,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":208377,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238093,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1927,"mean":17.85671443406,"rank":886,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":1039,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1927,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":11.192708333333,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"researcher":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":6,"Members of the public":7}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":30,"Student  > Ph.
