In estuaries, exposure to elevated CO(2) levels often co-occurs with other stressors, such as reduced salinity, which enhances the acidification trend, affects ion and acid-base regulation of estuarine calcifiers and modifies their response to ocean acidification. We studied the interactive effects of salinity and partial pressure of CO(2) (P(CO2)) on biomineralization and energy homeostasis in juveniles of the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, a common estuarine bivalve. Juveniles were exposed for 11 weeks to one of two environmentally relevant salinities (30 or 15 PSU) either at current atmospheric P(CO2) (\u223c400 \u03bcatm, normocapnia) or P(CO2) projected by moderate IPCC scenarios for the year 2100 (\u223c700-800 \u03bcatm, hypercapnia). Exposure of the juvenile oysters to elevated P(CO2) and\/or low salinity led to a significant increase in mortality, reduction of tissue energy stores (glycogen and lipid) and negative soft tissue growth, indicating energy deficiency. Interestingly, tissue ATP levels were not affected by exposure to changing salinity and P(CO2), suggesting that juvenile oysters maintain their cellular energy status at the expense of lipid and glycogen stores. At the same time, no compensatory upregulation of carbonic anhydrase activity was found under the conditions of low salinity and high P(CO2). Metabolic profiling using magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed altered metabolite status following low salinity exposure; specifically, acetate levels were lower in hypercapnic than in normocapnic individuals at low salinity. Combined exposure to hypercapnia and low salinity negatively affected mechanical properties of shells of the juveniles, resulting in reduced hardness and fracture resistance. Thus, our data suggest that the combined effects of elevated P(CO2) and fluctuating salinity may jeopardize the survival of eastern oysters because of weakening of their shells and increased energy consumption.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f43cf058f610002d97","doi":"10.1242\/jeb.061481","first_seen_on":"2011-12-13T11:39:39+00:00","issns":["1477-9145"],"journal":"Journal of Experimental Biology","last_mentioned_on":1419237802,"links":["http:\/\/jeb.biologists.org\/content\/215\/1\/29.short","http:\/\/jeb.biologists.org\/content\/215\/1\/29"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jeb.biologists.org\/content\/215\/1\/29.full.pdf","pmid":"22162851","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Company of Biologists, 140 Cowley Road Cambridge CB4 0DL United Kingdom","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Interactive effects of salinity and elevated CO2 levels on juvenile eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interactive-effects-salinity-elevated-co2-levels-juvenile-eastern-oysters-crassostrea-virginica-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.272,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.272},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691823,"mean":5.4318361211662,"rank":306015,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":4385951,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691823,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233269,"mean":4.3481222370837,"rank":14232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":219035,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233269,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3218,"mean":8.5857805408766,"rank":402,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":2816,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3218,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":360,"mean":7.0175877437326,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":316,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":360,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
