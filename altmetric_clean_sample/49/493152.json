Opening of the NMDA receptor ion channel pore is initiated by agonist-induced conformational changes in the extracellular ligand-binding domain (LBD) but the dynamic mechanism of this process remains unresolved. We studied how a disulfide bond in the obligatory GluN1 subunit-the sole site of redox modulation in NMDA receptors-controls this activation gating mechanism. This disulfide bond is located in the hinge region of the LBD, and presumably constrains agonist-induced cleft closure of the clamshell-like LBD. Elimination of this bond, by either DTT-mediated reduction or mutagenesis, enhances gating efficiency such that pore opening now occurs with higher frequency and longer duration. The most prominent effect was to shift opening modes to long duration openings reminiscent of a high P(o) gating mode that the NMDA receptor exhibits under ambient oxidizing conditions. In terms of preopen gating steps, elimination of this bond has effects only on the fast gating step consistent with this step being GluN1-specific and reflecting GluN1 gating movements immediately before channel opening. Overall, our results suggest that the dynamics of the GluN1 LBD have strong effects on late pore opening steps including regulating the duration of pore opening. This redox-mediated gating modulation could be an underlying mechanism of NMDA receptor malfunction in redox-dependent disease states and presents a potential target of pharmacologic action.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2011BpJ...101.2389T","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c89","doi":"10.1016\/j.bpj.2011.10.015","first_seen_on":"2011-12-14T20:18:02+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["00063495"],"journal":"Biophysical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1323892895,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0006349511012057"],"pmid":"22098737","pubdate":"2011-11-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Biophysical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics"],"title":"GluN1-Specific Redox Effects on the Kinetic Mechanism of NMDA Receptor Activation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/glun1specific-redox-effects-kinetic-mechanism-nmda-receptor-activation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506977,"mean":5.1265981649798,"rank":3085453,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":968911,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506977,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232859,"mean":4.2140565494854,"rank":145574,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":50064,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232859,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2060,"mean":2.7205730937348,"rank":1410,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2060,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125,"mean":1.6048870967742,"rank":78,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
