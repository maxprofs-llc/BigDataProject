The biochemical nature of the prion infectious agent remains unclear. Previously, using a protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) reaction, infectivity and disease-associated protease-resistant prion protein (PrPres) were both generated under cell-free conditions, which supported a nonviral hypothesis for the agent. However, these studies lacked comparative quantitation of both infectivity titers and PrPres, which is important both for biological comparison with in vivo-derived infectivity and for excluding contamination to explain the results. Here during four to eight rounds of PMCA, end-point dilution titrations detected a >320-fold increase in infectivity versus that in controls. These results provide strong support for the hypothesis that the agent of prion infectivity is not a virus. PMCA-generated samples caused the same clinical disease and neuropathology with the same rapid incubation period as the input brain-derived scrapie samples, providing no evidence for generation of a new strain in PMCA. However, the ratio of the infectivity titer to the amount of PrPres (specific infectivity) was much lower in PMCA versus brain-derived samples, suggesting the possibility that a substantial portion of PrPres generated in PMCA might be noninfectious.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2011PNAS..108E1244K","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Mikael Klingeborn","Brent Race","Kimberly D.
