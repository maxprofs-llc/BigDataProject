The study examines sudden unexpected infant deaths from 1991 to 2000 in the state of Kentucky, excluding homicides and deaths from identifiable natural causes. Meta-analysis provides a cosleeping prevalence control in normal infants. Based on the findings described herein, we conclude that cosleeping may represent a risk factor in sudden unexpected infant deaths and that a full scene investigation, including whether the infant was cosleeping, should be sought in all cases of sudden infant death.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f610006975","first_seen_on":"2011-12-15T16:55:36+00:00","issns":["0195-7910"],"issue":"1","journal":"The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1317840044,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15725774"],"pmid":"15725774","pubdate":"2005-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology","jurisprudence"],"title":"Cosleeping and sudden unexpected infant deaths in Kentucky: a 10-year retrospective case review.","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cosleeping-sudden-unexpected-infant-deaths-kentucky-10year-retrospective-case-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631265,"mean":4.9266893682253,"rank":2898500,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":80732,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631265,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229492,"mean":3.9047553237385,"rank":164150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":901,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229492,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":388,"mean":2.488857881137,"rank":265,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":388,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":1.3145161290323,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
