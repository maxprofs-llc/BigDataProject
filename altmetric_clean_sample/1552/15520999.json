You (Sichuan U): Well-organized, comprehensive review on oxidative C-H\/C-H couplings between (hetero)arenes."],"citation":{"abstract":"Transition metal-mediated C-H bond activation and functionalization represent one of the most straightforward and powerful tools in modern organic synthetic chemistry. Bi(hetero)aryls are privileged \u03c0-conjugated structural cores in biologically active molecules, organic functional materials, ligands, and organic synthetic intermediates. The oxidative C-H\/C-H coupling reactions between two (hetero)arenes through 2-fold C-H activation offer a valuable opportunity for rapid assembly of diverse bi(hetero)aryls and further exploitation of their applications in pharmaceutical and material sciences. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamentals and applications of transition metal-mediated\/catalyzed oxidative C-H\/C-H coupling reactions between two (hetero)arenes. The substrate scope, limitation, reaction mechanism, regioselectivity, and chemoselectivity, as well as related control strategies of these reactions are discussed. Additionally, the applications of these established methods in the synthesis of natural products and exploitation of new organic functional materials are exemplified. In the last section, a short introduction on oxidant- or Lewis acid-mediated oxidative Ar-H\/Ar-H coupling reactions is presented, considering that it is a very powerful method for the construction of biaryl units and polycylic arenes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024ed","authors":["Yudong Yang","Jingbo Lan","Jingsong You"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.chemrev.6b00567","first_seen_on":"2017-01-16T13:44:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-6890","0009-2665"],"journal":"Chemical Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1491323173,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.chemrev.6b00567"],"pmid":"28085272","pubdate":"2017-01-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Oxidative C\u2013H\/C\u2013H Coupling Reactions between Two (Hetero)arenes","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/oxidative-chch-coupling-reactions-between-two-heteroarenes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457084,"mean":7.1060307514935,"rank":4520097,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2355979,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457084,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282416,"mean":12.467610658074,"rank":158436,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":95904,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282416,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2000,"mean":3.9517498749375,"rank":1516,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":328,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2000,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":4.5540540540541,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
