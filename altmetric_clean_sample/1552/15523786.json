Maternal deaths due to cesarean-related hemorrhage during or within 42days of cesarean delivery at 24weeks or more were selected. Case records were audited using quantitative techniques to determine the events leading up to death.\nThere were 123 251 deliveries and 17 maternal deaths due to bleeding during or after cesarean (3.2 deaths per 10 000 deliveries). Risk factors included previous cesarean delivery, preoperative anemia, and placental abruption. Uterine atony and surgical trauma were the main causes of bleeding. Five (29%) women died before the cause of bleeding was found. Avoidable factors included delays in the recognition and management of shock. Thirteen (76%) women died within 48hours of the cesarean procedure.\nDeaths due to bleeding during and after cesarean have multifactorial causation. Maternal healthcare systems must be strengthened, with attention to the knowledge and skills of health workers. This requires increased clinical vigilance, a rapid effective response to obstetric hemorrhage and shock, and overall health system strengthening.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b55","authors":["Maswime, Salome","Buchmann, Eckhart"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijgo.2016.03.013","endpage":"323","first_seen_on":"2017-01-16T17:02:02+00:00","issns":["1879-3479"],"issue":"3","journal":"International Journal of Gynecology & Obstetrics","last_mentioned_on":1484591132,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1016\/j.ijgo.2016.03.013\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1016\/j.ijgo.2016.03.013\/pdf","pmid":"27352737","pubdate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"320","subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Causes and avoidable factors in maternal death due to cesarean-related hemorrhage in South Africa","type":"article","volume":"134","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/causes-avoidable-factors-maternal-death-due-cesareanrelated-hemorrhage-south-africa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8076231,"mean":6.8570644748779,"rank":4036861,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3834045,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8076231,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257997,"mean":12.84544674336,"rank":134981,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":113075,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257997,"percentile":43},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1635,"mean":3.8921199510404,"rank":1072,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":529,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1635,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":3.6040322580645,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
