Women were older and had a worse cardiovascular risk profile than men, but less extended angiographic coronary disease. Irrespective of the presenting diagnosis, women had lower VH-IVUS derived plaque burden then men (38.1% vs. 40.5% in SAP, and 35.9% vs. 38.8% in ACS). Standardized (mean 211 vs 263 mm3 in SAP, and, 199 vs 245 mm3 in ACS) total plaque volume was lower in women. Volumes of fibrous tissue, fibro-fatty tissue, necrotic core and dense calcium were also lower in women. NIRS-derived lipid core burden index (LCBI) was lower in women, in particular in SAP (mean LCBI in the worst 4mm 220 vs. 240). The observed differences remained significant after adjustment for clinical characteristics.\nWomen had more favourable plaque characteristics than men, despite their worse risk profile. Long-term follow-up studies are required to evaluate the clinical consequences.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9133cf058f61000ccce","authors":["Haaf Monique E. ten","Haaf Monique E. ten","Rijndertse Melissa","Rijndertse Melissa","Cheng Jin M.","Cheng Jin M.","de Boer Sanneke P.M.","de Boer Sanneke P.M.","Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda Hector M.","Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda Hector M.","van Geuns Robert-Jan M.","van Geuns Robert-Jan M.","Regar Evelyn S.","Regar Evelyn S.","Lenzen Mattie J.","Lenzen Mattie J.","Appelman Yolande","Appelman Yolande","Boersma Eric","Boersma Eric"],"doi":"10.4244\/eij-d-16-00361","first_seen_on":"2017-06-29T09:45:15+00:00","issns":["1774-024X","1969-6213"],"journal":"EuroIntervention","last_mentioned_on":1498780752,"links":["https:\/\/www.pcronline.com\/eurointervention\/118th_issue\/volume-13\/number-3\/49\/sex-differences-in-plaque-characteristics-by-intravascular-imaging-in-patients-with-coronary-artery-disease.html"],"pmid":"27867141","pubdate":"2017-06-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Europa Digital & Publishing","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Sex differences in plaque characteristics by intravascular imaging in patients with coronary artery disease","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sex-differences-plaque-characteristics-intravascular-imaging-patients-coronary-artery-disease-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.3,"score_history":{"1y":6.3,"6m":6.3,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8440126,"mean":7.0979478654558,"rank":1371423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":7065424,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8440126,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236256,"mean":12.99111146854,"rank":54158,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":181842,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236256,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":852,"mean":4.615741480611,"rank":164,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":684,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":852,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97,"mean":8.8317708333333,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"researcher":1,"practitioner":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":8,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":4,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"BR":1,"IN":2,"ES":1,"VE":1,"DO":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/EuroInterventio\/statuses\/880361464829227009","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21408107],"posted_on":"2017-06-29T09:45:04+00:00","author":{"name":"EuroIntervention","url":"http:\/\/www.eurointervention.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/600596043479285761\/t-iB-U-O_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"EuroInterventio","tweeter_id":"293515297","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1929},"tweet_id":"880361464829227009"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/VijayKunadian\/statuses\/880361687710388224","license":"gnip","rt":["EuroInterventio"],"citation_ids":[21408107],"posted_on":"2017-06-29T09:45:57+00:00","author":{"name":"Vijay Kunadian","url":"http:\/\/www.ncl.ac.uk\/icm\/people\/profile\/vijaykunadian.html#background","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/861245499277365248\/PbmAueLl_normal.jpg","description":"Academic Consultant Interventional Cardiologist Freeman Hospital Newcastle University Christian Chief Investigator @SNR_RITA_Trial Tweets my own","id_on_source":"VijayKunadian","tweeter_id":"853077397","geo":{"lt":54.97328,"ln":-1.61396,"country":"GB"},"followers":782},"tweet_id":"880361687710388224"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/mirvatalasnag\/statuses\/880365866835116033","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21408107],"posted_on":"2017-06-29T10:02:33+00:00","author":{"name":"mirvat","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/847134604314263553\/agbeWSXw_normal.jpg","description":"Interventional Cardiologist, mom, love books & comedy of all sorts","id_on_source":"mirvatalasnag","tweeter_id":"257030275","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1574},"tweet_id":"880365866835116033"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/alxbenevides\/statuses\/880373226572009472","license":"gnip","rt":["EuroInterventio"],"citation_ids":[21408107],"posted_on":"2017-06-29T10:31:48+00:00","author":{"name":"Alex M Benevides, MD","url":"http:\/\/Instagram.com\/alexbenevides","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/867540777521618945\/1eRWd1DC_normal.jpg","description":"Cardiovascular surgeon, father, husband and a lover of life; in all its letters, sounds and colors.
