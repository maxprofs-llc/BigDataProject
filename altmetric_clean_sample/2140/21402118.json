Recently, our group and others identified germline genetic variants in NUDT15 as another major cause of thiopurine-related myelosuppression, particularly in Asians and Hispanics. Herein we described three novel NUDT15 coding variants (p.R34T, p.K35E, p.G17_V18del) in five children with ALL enrolled in frontline protocols in Singapore, Taiwan, and St Jude Children's Research Hospital. Patients carrying these variants experienced significant toxicity and reduced tolerance to MP across treatment protocols. Functionally, all three variants led to partial to complete loss of NUDT15 nucleotide diphosphatase activity and negatively influenced protein stability. In particular, the p.G17_V18del variant protein showed extremely low thermostability and was completely void of catalytic activity, thus likely to confer a high risk for thiopurine intolerance. This in-frame deletion was only seen in African and European patients, and is the first NUDT15 risk variant identified in non-Asian, non-Hispanic populations. In conclusion, we discovered three novel loss-of-function variants in NUDT15 associated with MP toxicity, enabling more comprehensive pharmacogenetics-based thiopurine dose adjustments across diverse populations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cba","authors":["Takaya Moriyama","Yung-Li Yang","Rina Nishii","Hany Ariffin","Chengcheng Liu","Ting-Nien Lin","Wenjian Yang","Dong-Tsamn Lin","Chih-Hsiang Yu","Shirley Kham","Ching-Hon Pui","William E.
