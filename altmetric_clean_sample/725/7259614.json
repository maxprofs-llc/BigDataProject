Data for this study came from four samples of naturalistic mother-child speech taken over the course of one year from four autistic, four Down's syndrome and four normal children, covering a range of MLU stages. In general, autistic children used more formulaic language, including imitations, than Down's syndrome children, who in turn used more than the normal children. Comparisons of imitative and spontaneous corpora from the same transcripts were made using MLU and the Index of Productive Syntax. The main findings were that, with few exceptions, spontaneous speech utterances were longer, and contained more advanced grammatical construction than did the imitation utterances. These findings held across all three groups of subjects. We conclude that imitation does not facilitate grammatical development.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a0b","authors":["Tager-Flusberg, H","Calkins, S"],"first_seen_on":"2016-05-08T11:20:55+00:00","issns":["0305-0009"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Child Language","last_mentioned_on":1426595400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2148571"],"pmid":"2148571","pubdate":"1990-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Language, Communication And Culture","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology","Arts and Humanities"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Does imitation facilitate the acquisition of grammar?
