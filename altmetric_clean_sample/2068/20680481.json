Sclerotherapy (ST) and prolotherapy (AT) are two promising options among the numerous other conservative therapies. Since their efficacy and potential adverse effects (AE) are still unclear, we systematically searched, analysed, and synthesised the available literature on ST and PT for treatingAT. Electronic databases, GoogleScholar and articles' reference lists were searched according to PRISMA guidelines. Eligibility criteria were set up according to the PICOS-scheme including human and animal studies. Three authors independently reviewed the results and evaluated methodological quality (Coleman Methodology Score and Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment). The initial search yielded 1104 entries. After screening, 18 articles were available for qualitative synthesis, six of which were subjected to meta-analysis. The mean Coleman Score of the thirteen human studies was 50. Four RCTs were ranked as having a low risk of selection bias. Three of those reported a statistically significant drop in the VAS score, one a significant increase in the VISA-A Score. 12 of 13 human studies reported positive results in achieving pain relief and patient satisfaction, whereas only one study's finding differed. Meta-analysis revealed an unambiguous result in favour of the intervention (weighted mean difference D=-4.67cm, 95% CI -5.56 to - 3.76 cm (p<0.001)). Only one serious AE and two minor AEs were reported in the entire literature. This SR suggests that ST and PT may be effective treatment options for AT and that they can be considered safe. Long-term studies and RCTs, are still needed to support their recommendation. This article is protected by copyright.
