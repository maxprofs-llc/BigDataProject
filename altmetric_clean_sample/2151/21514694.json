At the start of the study, an epidemiological survey was performed, and baseline glycaemia, HbA1c, body mass index and waist circumference were measured. A follow-up of 6.4years was conducted. New cases of type2 diabetes were identified using the electronic primary care medical history.\nThe incidence of type2 diabetes was 3.5 cases\/1000 person-years. In the multivariate analysis, the variables that were associated with the onset of type2 diabetes were age, family history of diabetes, baseline glycaemia (100-125mg\/dL), HbA1c (5.7-6.4%) and waist circumference (\u226594cm for men and \u226580cm for women). Of these, the most significantly associated variables were baseline glycaemia and HbA1c. The ADA and WHO criteria for defining prediabetes had the same predictive capacity.\nThe incidence of type2 diabetes measured in Madrid was lower than that found in other population studies, with the glucometabolic state the main factor associated with progression to type2 diabetes. There were no differences between the prediabetes defined by the ADA and the WHO for predicting the onset of the disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6363cf058f6100087a0","authors":["E.
