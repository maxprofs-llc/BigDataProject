Molecular characterization of circulating tumor cells (CTC) is crucial for the investigation of molecular-targeted therapies while predictive biomarkers for response to PD1 checkpoint inhibitors are lacking. We sought to assess whether overexpression of PD-L1 in CTCs could be detected at baseline and at different timepoints during treatment in a prospective cohort of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients and used to predict clinical outcome after treatment with curative intent.\nWe developed a highly sensitive, specific and robust RT-qPCR assay for PD-L1 mRNA expression in EpCAM(+) CTCs. In a prospective cohort of 113 locally advanced HNSCC patients treated with curative intent we evaluated PD-L1 expression in the EpCAM(+) CTC fraction at baseline, after 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy (week 6) and at the end of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (week 15).\nPD-L1 overexpression was found in 24\/94 (25.5%) patients at baseline, 8\/34 (23.5%) after induction chemotherapy and 12\/54 (22.2%) patients at the end of treatment. Patients with CTCs overexpressing PD-L1 at end of treatment had shorter progression-free survival (P\u2009=\u20090.001) and overall survival (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that PD-L1 overexpression at end of treatment was independent prognostic factor for progression-free survival and overall survival. The absence of PD-L1 overexpression at the end of treatment was strongly associated with complete response with an odds ratio\u2009=\u200916.00 (95% CI\u2009=\u20092.76-92.72, P\u2009=\u20090.002).\nWe demonstrate that detection of CTCs overexpressing PD-L1 is feasible and may provide important prognostic information in HNSCC. Our results suggest that adjuvant PD1 inhibitors deserve evaluation in HNSCC patients in whom PD-L1(+) CTCs are detected at the end of curative treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002280","authors":["Strati, A.","Koutsodontis, G.","Papaxoinis, G.","Angelidis, I.","Zavridou, M.","Economopoulou, P.","Kotsantis, I.","Avgeris, M.","Mazel, M.","Perisanidis, C.","Sasaki, C.","Alix-Panabi\u00e8res, C.","Lianidou, E.","Psyrri, A.","A.
