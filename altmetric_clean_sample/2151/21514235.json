This group recommends that most of the same precision and accuracy validation criteria used for ligand-binding assays (LBAs) be applied to LC-MS\/MS-based assays where proteins are quantified using the LC-MS\/MS signal from a surrogate peptide after proteolytic digestion (PrD-LCMS methods). PrD-LCMS methods are generally more complex than small molecule LC-MS\/MS assays and may often include LBA procedures, leading to the recommendation for a combination of chromatographic and LBA validation strategies and appropriate acceptance criteria. Several key aspects of this bioanalytical approach that are discussed in the White Paper are treated here in additional detail. These topics include selectivity\/specificity, matrix effect, digestion efficiency, stability and critical reagent considerations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c2c","authors":["Jeffrey X Duggan","Faye Vazvaei","Rand Jenkins"],"doi":"10.4155\/bio.15.69","first_seen_on":"2017-07-04T18:19:58+00:00","issns":["1757-6180","1757-6199"],"issue":"11","journal":"Bioanalysis","last_mentioned_on":1499162100,"links":["https:\/\/www.future-science.com\/doi\/full\/10.4155\/bio.15.69"],"pmid":"26110712","pubdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":" Future Science Ltd London, UK ","subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Bioanalytical method validation considerations for LC\u2013MS\/MS assays of therapeutic proteins","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bioanalytical-method-validation-considerations-lcmsms-assays-therapeutic-proteins"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.08,"score_history":{"1y":5.08,"6m":5.08,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8461697,"mean":7.1088157534769,"rank":1641022,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6798783,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8461697,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236013,"mean":12.962497161161,"rank":60543,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":174616,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236013,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":556,"mean":2.0561369369369,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":475,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":556,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":3.9426923076923,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":3,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Chemistry":4,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"NL":1,"FR":1}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Special recognition of Jeff Duggan on his retirement","url":"https:\/\/www.bioanalysis-zone.com\/2017\/07\/04\/special-recognition-jeff-duggan-retirement\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[21514235,12684572,5042680,14202881,3974797,3009043,21514236],"posted_on":"2017-07-04T09:55:00+00:00","summary":"Jeff Duggan, Director, Bioanalytical Mass Spectrometry, Boehringer-Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals (CT, USA) started his career in pharmaceutical bioanalysis over 20 years ago.
