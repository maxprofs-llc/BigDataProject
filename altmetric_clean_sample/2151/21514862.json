The study population was described in terms of: age, dependency situation, preferences, support network and clinical factors at the time of inclusion in the study. Separate analysis was made for men and women. A logistic regression model was designed to determine the risk factors for institutionalization for each sex.\n87,4% of women and 85,9% of men expressed their wish to receive care in their own home. The risk of institutionalization is three times higher among men than among women. Among women, the risks of institutionalization are: level of dependency, wishing to move into a residential care home, medium consistency and fragility of support network and being diagnosed with dementia. Among men, the risks are: wishing to move into a residential care home and low or medium consistency of support network.\nCare in the home is the preferred alternative for elderly persons in dependency situations. The risk of institutionalization is conditioned more by the preferences of the person and their family and the characteristics of the support network than by individual's clinical condition.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f6100058c0","authors":["Sandra Pinz\u00f3n-Pulido","Francisco Garrido Pe\u00f1a","V\u00edctor Reyes Alc\u00e1zar","Joaqu\u00edn Salvador Lima-Rodr\u00edguez","Mar\u00eda Fernanda Raposo Triano","Manuel Mart\u00ednez Domene","Federico Alonso Trujillo"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.enfcli.2015.08.003","first_seen_on":"2017-07-04T19:18:19+00:00","issns":["11308621"],"journal":"Enfermeria clinica.","last_mentioned_on":1450777717,"links":["http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S113086211500114X"],"pmid":"26363992","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing","medicine"],"title":"Factores predictores de la institucionalizaci\u00f3n de personas mayores en situaci\u00f3n de dependencia en Andaluc\u00eda","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/factores-predictores-la-institucionalizacin-personas-mayores-en-situacin-dependencia-en-andaluca"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7987155,"mean":6.735352427655,"rank":4193013,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2231697,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7987155,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100921,"mean":10.824603864447,"rank":53259,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":37622,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100921,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121,"mean":2.6447,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.8125,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":4,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":8,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/falonsotru\/statuses\/679237092728283137","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21514862],"posted_on":"2015-12-22T09:48:37+00:00","author":{"name":"falonsotru","url":"http:\/\/longevidad.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2812262246\/e463ec4ae871a644463feeea98d4a50f_normal.png","description":"Aprendiz de brujo","id_on_source":"falonsotru","tweeter_id":"928300292","geo":{"lt":37.38241,"ln":-5.97613,"country":"ES"},"followers":57},"tweet_id":"679237092728283137"}]}}
