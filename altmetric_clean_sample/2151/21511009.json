However, there is still lack of consensus on development and evaluation guidelines. It is important to note that the game performance depends on the designed scenario.\nThe objective of this work was to develop specific game scenarios and evaluate them with a panel of musculoskeletal patients to propose game development and evaluation guidelines.\nA two-stage workflow was proposed using determinant framework. The development guideline includes the selection of three-dimensional (3D) computer graphics technologies and tools, the modeling of physical aspects, the design of rehabilitation scenarios, and the implementation of the proposed scenarios. The evaluation guideline consists of the definition of evaluation metrics, the execution of the evaluation campaign, the analysis of user results and feedbacks, and the improvement of the designed game.\nThe case study for musculoskeletal disorders on the healthy control and patient groups showed the usefulness of these guidelines and associated games. All participants enjoyed the 2 developed games (football and object manipulation), and found them challenging and amusing. In particular, some healthy subjects increased their score when enhancing the level of difficulty. Furthermore, there were no risks and accidents associated with the execution of these games.\nIt is expected that with the proven effectiveness of the proposed guidelines and associated games, this new rehabilitation game may be translated into clinical routine practice for the benefit of patients with musculoskeletal disorders.","altmetric_jid":"56b367f62a83eea9718b4683","authors":["Mohamad Idriss"],"doi":"10.2196\/games.7284","first_seen_on":"2017-07-04T15:06:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2291-9279"],"issue":"3","journal":"JMIR Serious Games","last_mentioned_on":1501654366,"links":["http:\/\/games.jmir.org\/2017\/3\/e14\/","http:\/\/games.jmir.org\/2017\/3\/e14\/?platform=hootsuite"],"pmid":"28676468","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"JMIR Publications Inc., Toronto, Canada","title":"Rehabilitation-Oriented Serious Game Development and Evaluation Guidelines for Musculoskeletal Disorders","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rehabilitationoriented-serious-game-development-evaluation-guidelines-musculoskeletal-disorders"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":2.85,"6m":2.85,"3m":2.85,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8314034,"mean":7.0059620328577,"rank":3271250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5006675,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8314034,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":224644,"mean":12.131072866726,"rank":76165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":146962,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":224644,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":10.094915254237,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"AU":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/vsouders\/statuses\/882254116008972288","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21511009],"posted_on":"2017-07-04T15:05:47+00:00","author":{"name":"vsouders","url":"http:\/\/www.bionautica.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3044758911\/5b5cb747aa58f345df02f076aa6eae8f_normal.jpeg","description":"Founder at Plas.md.
