It has also been demonstrated that Rint1 is essential in vesicle trafficking from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through interaction with Zeste-White 10 (ZW10). We have isolated a novel interaction between Rint1 and the human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) transcription and replication factor E2. E2 binds to Rint1 within its ZW10 interaction domain and we show that in the absence of E2, Rint1 is localized to the ER and associates with ZW10. E2 expression results in a disruption of Rint1-ZW10 interaction and an accumulation of nuclear Rint1 protein, coincident with a significant reduction in vesicle movement from the ER to Golgi. Interestingly, nuclear Rint1 protein and members of the Mre11\/Rad50\/Nbs1 (MRN) were found in distinct E2 nuclear foci, which peaked during mid-S phase, indicating that recruitment of Rint1 to E2 foci within the nucleus may also result in recruitment of this DNA damage sensing protein complex. We show that exogenous Rint1 expression enhances E2-dependent virus replication. Conversely, over-expression of a truncated Rint1 protein that retains the E2-binding domain but not the Rad50 binding domain acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of E2-dependent HPV replication. Put together, these experiments demonstrate that the interaction between Rint1 and E2 has an important function in HPV replication.\nHPV infections are an important driver of many epithelial cancers including those within the anogenital and oropharygeal tracts. The HPV life cycle is tightly regulated and intimately linked to the differentiation of the epithelial cells it infects. HPV replication factories formed in the nucleus are locations where viral DNA is copied to support viral persistence and amplification of infection. The recruitment of specific cellular protein complexes to these factories aids efficient and controlled viral replication. We have identified a novel HPV-host interaction that functions in the cellular response to DNA damage and cell cycle control. We show that the HPV E2 protein targets Rad50-interacting protein 1 (Rint1) to facilitate virus genome replication. These findings add to our understanding of how HPV replicates and the host cell pathways that are targeted by HPV to support virus replication. Understanding these pathways will allow further research into novel inhibitors of HPV genome replication.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f92","authors":["Karen Campos Le\u00f3n","Kalpanee Wijendra","Abida Siddiqa","Ieisha Pentland","Katherine M.
