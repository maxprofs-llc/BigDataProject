We aimed to determine if next to genetic variations like SNPs further mechanisms might play a role in the pathogenesis of PCOS. We examined the effect of copy-number variations (CNVs) on metabolic phenotypes in PCOS. The intragenic rs1244979, rs2815752 in NEGR1 gene, and rs780094 in GCKR gene were genotyped and CNVs were determined by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) in PCOS patients (n\u2009=\u2009153) and controls without metabolic syndrome (n\u2009=\u2009142). The study indicated that SNPs are not associated with the pathogenesis of PCOS but affect metabolic phenotypes. The CNVs investigated show a lower variability in PCOS than in CON. Furthermore, we provided direct evidence that the copy number, but not the genotype of the CNV in the genomic regions of rs780094(GCKR) is associated with low level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in PCOS. This study supports the hypothesis that not only genetic variants, but also CNVs in metabolically relevant genes, have an effect on metabolic phenotypes in our group of PCOS patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081dd","authors":["Birgit Knebel","Stefan Lehr","Onno E.
