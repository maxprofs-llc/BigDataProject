Carbonyl and vinyl indices were used to avoid counting biopolymers as plastics. Microplastics composed of variety of polymers, including polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyethyleneterphthalates (PET), polyethylene-polypropylene copolymer (PEP), and polyacrylates (PAK), were identified in the sediment. We measured microplastics between 315\u00a0\u00b5m and 5\u00a0mm, most of which were in the range 315\u00a0\u00b5m-1\u00a0mm. The abundance of microplastics in surface sediment varied from 100 pieces\/kg-dry sediment in a core collected in the Gulf of Thailand to 1900 pieces\/kg-dry sediment in a core collected in a canal in Tokyo Bay. A far higher stock of PE and PP composed microplastics in sediment compared with surface water samples collected in a canal in Tokyo Bay suggests that sediment is an important sink for microplastics. In dated sediment cores from Japan, microplastic pollution started in 1950s, and their abundance increased markedly toward the surface layer (i.e., 2000s). In all sediment cores from Japan, Thailand, Malaysia, and South Africa, the abundance of microplastics increased toward the surface, suggesting the global occurrence of and an increase in microplastic pollution over time.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f61000649d","authors":["Yukari Matsuguma","Hideshige Takada","Hidetoshi Kumata","Hirohide Kanke","Shigeaki Sakurai","Tokuma Suzuki","Maki Itoh","Yohei Okazaki","Ruchaya Boonyatumanond","Mohamad Pauzi Zakaria","Steven Weerts","Brent Newman","Matsuguma, Yukari","Takada, Hideshige","Kumata, Hidetoshi","Kanke, Hirohide","Sakurai, Shigeaki","Suzuki, Tokuma","Itoh, Maki","Okazaki, Yohei","Boonyatumanond, Ruchaya","Zakaria, Mohamad Pauzi","Weerts, Steven","Newman, Brent"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00244-017-0414-9","first_seen_on":"2017-05-22T19:13:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0090-4341","1432-0703"],"journal":"Archives of Environmental Contamination & Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1501199831,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00244-017-0414-9","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28534067?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00244-017-0414-9"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00244-017-0414-9.pdf","pmid":"28534067","pubdate":"2017-05-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Microplastics in Sediment Cores from Asia and Africa as Indicators of Temporal Trends in Plastic Pollution","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microplastics-sediment-cores-asia-africa-indicators-temporal-trends-plastic-pollution"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.3,"score_history":{"1y":5.3,"6m":5.3,"3m":1.85,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8282957,"mean":6.9842712712639,"rank":1540917,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6737806,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8282957,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238713,"mean":12.19625496833,"rank":58247,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":180140,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238713,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1189,"mean":4.0905707070707,"rank":182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":1007,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1189,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":1.2385714285714,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
