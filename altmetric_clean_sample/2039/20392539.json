Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to evaluate the relationship between resistant starch supplementation and large intestinal function. Three electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus) were searched to identify eligible studies. The standardized mean difference (SMD) or weighted mean difference (WMD) was calculated using a fixed-effects model or a random-effects model. The pooled findings revealed that resistant starch significantly increased fecal wet weight (WMD 35.51\u2009g\/d, 95% CI 1.21, 69.82) and butyrate concentration (SMD 0.61, 95% CI 0.32, 0.89). Also, it significantly reduced fecal PH (WMD -0.19, 95% CI -0.35, -0.03), but the increment of defecation frequency were not statistically significant (WMD 0.04stools\/g, 95% CI -0.08, 0.16). To conclude, our study found that resistant starch elicited a beneficial effect on the function of large bowel in healthy adults.[Formula: see text].","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e3f","authors":["Deqiang Shen","Hao Bai","Zhaoping Li","Yue Yu","Huanhuan Zhang","Liyong Chen"],"doi":"10.1080\/09637486.2016.1226275","first_seen_on":"2017-05-22T20:36:49+00:00","issns":["0963-7486","1465-3478"],"journal":"International Journal of Food Sciences & Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1495579661,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27593182"],"pmid":"27593182","pubdate":"2017-02-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Positive effects of resistant starch supplementation on bowel function in healthy adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/positive-effects-resistant-starch-supplementation-bowel-function-healthy-adults-systematic-review-me-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":2.6,"6m":2.6,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8255097,"mean":6.9732502228862,"rank":3332360,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4897415,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8255097,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237245,"mean":12.173593161471,"rank":85134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":150703,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237245,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":669,"mean":8.7785179640719,"rank":306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":362,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":669,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":9.9235714285714,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Chemical Engineering":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Resistant Starch & Colon Cancer | NutritionFacts.org","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1726192340730601&id=215513991798451","license":"public","citation_ids":[20392539],"posted_on":"2017-05-22T17:00:41+00:00","summary":"Resistant starch has a beneficial effect on colon function (http:\/\/bit.ly\/2ie0Ryn) likely by feeding our good gut bacteria.
