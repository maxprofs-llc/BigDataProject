Significant contribution to the biology of inflammation.","Kanneganti lab: Distinct regulatory mechanisms control proinflammatory cytokines IL-18 IL-1beta #immunology"],"citation":{"abstract":"Interleukin-18 and IL-1\u03b2, which are cytokines of the IL-1 family, are synthesized as precursor proteins and activated by the inflammasome via proteolytic processing. IL-1\u03b2 is only induced in response to inflammatory stimuli, but IL-18 is constitutively expressed. However, how IL-18 and IL-1\u03b2 expression is regulated by different inflammatory signals remains poorly studied. In this study, we found that IL-18 and IL-1\u03b2 are differentially regulated. Despite being constitutively expressed, IL-18 expression was increased and sustained after stimulation of TLRs. In contrast, IL-1\u03b2 was induced but not sustained after chronic treatment. Furthermore, type I IFN signaling was essential for induction of IL-18 and macrophages lacking type I IFN signaling were impaired in their ability to promote IL-18 induction. Thus, our findings reveal a fundamental difference in IL-18 and IL-1\u03b2 regulation and uncover novel mechanisms that are relevant to the inflammatory settings where these proinflammatory cytokines play a critical role.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cc7","authors":["Qifan Zhu","Thirumala-Devi Kanneganti"],"doi":"10.4049\/jimmunol.1700352","first_seen_on":"2017-05-23T02:31:10+00:00","funders":["niaid","nci","niams","niehs"],"issns":["0022-1767","1550-6606"],"journal":"The Journal of Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1496155679,"links":["http:\/\/www.jimmunol.org\/content\/198\/11\/4210","http:\/\/www.jimmunol.org\/content\/198\/11\/4210?platform=hootsuite"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jimmunol.org\/content\/jimmunol\/198\/11\/4210.full.pdf","pmid":"28468974","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Association of Immunologists","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Cutting Edge: Distinct Regulatory Mechanisms Control Proinflammatory Cytokines IL-18 and IL-1\u03b2","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cutting-edge-distinct-regulatory-mechanisms-control-proinflammatory-cytokines-il18-il1%CE%B2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8290197,"mean":6.9872012989734,"rank":2117166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5042579,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8290197,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239110,"mean":12.154283870536,"rank":78900,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":157779,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239110,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6850,"mean":2.880132282085,"rank":1053,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4350,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6850,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":212,"mean":3.9737630331754,"rank":78,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":133,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":212,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
