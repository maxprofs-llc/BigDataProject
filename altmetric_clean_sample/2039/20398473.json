The bioactive proteins and peptides derived from marine fish have gained enormous interest in nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, and cosmeceutical industries due to their broad spectrum of bioactivities, including antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-aging activities. Recently, the development of cosmeceuticals using marine fish-derived proteins and peptides obtained from chemical or enzymatical hydrolysis of fish processing by-products has increased rapidly owing to their activities in antioxidation and tissue regeneration. Marine fish-derived collagen has been utilized for the development of cosmeceutical products due to its abilities in skin repair and tissue regeneration. Marine fish-derived peptides have also been utilized for various cosmeceutical applications due to their antioxidant, antimicrobial, and matrix metalloproteinase inhibitory activities. In addition, marine fish-derived proteins and hydrolysates demonstrated efficient anti-photoaging activity. The present review highlights and presents an overview of the current status of the isolation and applications of marine fish-derived proteins and peptides. This review also demonstrates that marine fish-derived proteins and peptides have high potential for biocompatible and effective cosmeceuticals.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f61000668a","authors":["Venkatesan, Jayachandran","Anil, Sukumaran","Kim, Se-Kwon","Shim, Min Suk","Jayachandran Venkatesan","Sukumaran Anil","Se-Kwon Kim","Min Shim"],"doi":"10.3390\/md15050143","first_seen_on":"2017-05-23T04:19:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1660-3397"],"issue":"5","journal":"Marine Drugs","last_mentioned_on":1495514273,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28524092","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-3397\/15\/5\/143","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/md15050143"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-3397\/15\/5\/143\/pdf","pmid":"28524092","pubdate":"2017-05-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["biology","pharmacology"],"title":"Marine Fish Proteins and Peptides for Cosmeceuticals: A Review.","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/marine-fish-proteins-peptides-cosmeceuticals-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8255097,"mean":6.9732502228862,"rank":4388889,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2297657,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8255097,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237279,"mean":12.12389216868,"rank":130349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":84716,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237279,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1057,"mean":3.5131685606061,"rank":565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":373,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1057,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":1.9848648648649,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":49}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
