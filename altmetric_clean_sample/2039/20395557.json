This signal detection method requires 16-fold less RNA for probe synthesis, does not depend on the incorporation of fluorescent dNTPs into a reverse transcription reaction, generates a high signal-to-background ratio, and can be used to allow for multichannel detection on a single chip. Furthermore, since the dendrimers can be detected individually, it may be possible, by employing dendrimer-binding standards, to calculate the numbers of bound cDNAs can be estimated. These features make the dendrimer signal detection reagent ideal for high-throughput functional genomics research.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003322","authors":["Stears, R L","Getts, R C","Gullans, S R"],"first_seen_on":"2017-05-23T00:25:55+00:00","issns":["1531-2267"],"issue":"2","journal":"Physiological Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1495499146,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11015604"],"pmid":"11015604","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"A novel, sensitive detection system for high-density microarrays using dendrimer technology.","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-sensitive-detection-system-highdensity-microarrays-using-dendrimer-technology"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8255097,"mean":6.9732502228862,"rank":2105524,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5024292,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8255097,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237280,"mean":12.123894175211,"rank":77986,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":156895,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237280,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":462,"mean":4.0280824295011,"rank":93,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":462,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":4.151,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":18,"Student  > Ph.
