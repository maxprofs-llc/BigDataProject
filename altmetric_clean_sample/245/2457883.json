However, it has been a matter of debate whether this toxin has central or peripheral sites of action. We employed a rat model in which BoNT\/A1 or BoNT\/A2 was unilaterally injected into the gastrocnemius muscle. On time-course measurements of compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes after injection of BoNT\/A1 or BoNT\/A2 at doses ranging from 1.7 to 13.6\u2009U, CMAP amplitude for the ipsilateral hind leg was markedly decreased on the first day, and this muscle flaccidity persisted up to the 14th day. Of note, both BoNT\/A1 and BoNT\/A2 administrations also resulted in decreased CMAP amplitudes for the contralateral leg in a dose-dependent manner ranging from 1.7 to 13.6\u2009U, and this muscle flaccidity increased until the fourth day and then slowly recovered. Immunohistochemical results revealed that BoNT\/A-cleaved synaptosomal-associated protein of 25\u2009kDa (SNAP-25) appeared in the bilateral ventral and dorsal horns 4\u2009days after injection of BoNT\/A1 (10\u2009U) or BoNT\/A2 (10\u2009U), although there seemed to be a wider spread of BoNT\/A-cleaved SNAP-25 associated with BoNT\/A1 than BoNT\/A2 in the contralateral spinal cord. This suggests that the catalytically active BoNT\/A1 and BoNT\/A2 were axonally transported via peripheral motor and sensory nerves to the spinal cord, where they spread through a transcytosis (cell-to-cell trafficking) mechanism. Our results provide evidence for the central effects of intramuscularly administered BoNT\/A1 and BoNT\/A2 in the spinal cord, and a new insight into the clinical effects of peripheral BoNT\/A applications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008ecf","authors":["Koizumi, Hidetaka","Goto, Satoshi","Okita, Shinya","Morigaki, Ryoma","Akaike, Norio","Torii, Yasushi","Harakawa, Tetsuhiro","Ginnaga, Akihiro","Kaji, Ryuji"],"doi":"10.3389\/fneur.2014.00098","first_seen_on":"2014-06-23T11:45:43+00:00","issns":["","1664-2295"],"journal":"Movement Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1403523924,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fneur.2014.00098\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fneur.2014.00098\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4066301","pmid":"25002857","pubdate":"2014-05-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"title":"Spinal Central Effects of Peripherally Applied Botulinum Neurotoxin A in Comparison between Its Subtypes A1 and A2","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/spinal-central-effects-peripherally-applied-botulinum-neurotoxin-comparison-between-subtypes-a1-a2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":3038008,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":928717,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107884,"mean":7.8222731848394,"rank":70545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":24334,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107884,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1566,"mean":3.0669840255591,"rank":1199,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1566,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":1.8941176470588,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
