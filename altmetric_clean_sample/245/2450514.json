GST pulldowns demonstrated that two highly conserved segments in the cytoplasmic domain of calsyntenin-1 mediate binding to the tetratricopeptide repeats of KLC1. A complex containing calsyntenin-1 and the Kinesin-1 motor was isolated from developing mouse brain and immunoelectron microscopy located calsyntenin-1 in association with tubulovesicular organelles in axonal fiber tracts. In primary neuronal cultures, calsyntenin-1-containing organelles were aligned along microtubules and partially colocalized with Kinesin-1. Using live imaging, we showed that these organelles are transported along axons with a velocity and processivity typical for fast axonal transport. Point mutations in the two kinesin-binding segments of calsyntenin-1 significantly reduced binding to KLC1 in vitro, and vesicles bearing mutated calsyntenin-1 exhibited a markedly altered anterograde axonal transport. In summary, our results indicate that calsyntenin-1 links a certain type of vesicular and tubulovesicular organelles to the Kinesin-1 motor.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c7","authors":["Anetta Konecna","Renato Frischknecht","Jochen Kinter","Alexander Ludwig","Martin Steuble","Virginia Meskenaite","Martin Inderm\u00fchle","Marianne Engel","Chuan Cen","Jos\u00e9-Maria Mateos","Peter Streit","Peter Sonderegger"],"doi":"10.1091\/mbc.e06-02-0112","first_seen_on":"2014-06-19T20:51:47+00:00","issns":["1939-4586","1059-1524"],"issue":"8","journal":"Molecular Biology of the Cell","last_mentioned_on":1403182260,"links":["http:\/\/www.molbiolcell.org\/content\/17\/8\/3651","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1091\/mbc.E06-02-0112","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16760430","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1525238"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.molbiolcell.org\/content\/17\/8\/3651.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1525238","pmid":"16760430","pubdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"Calsyntenin-1 Docks Vesicular Cargo to Kinesin-1","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/calsyntenin1-docks-vesicular-cargo-kinesin1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3927047,"mean":5.0186583714733,"rank":258779,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":3662164,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3927047,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97449,"mean":7.6031163129593,"rank":9380,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":88061,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97449,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1928,"mean":2.4690436137072,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":1895,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1928,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":1.48896,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":98}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
