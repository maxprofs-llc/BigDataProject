The aim of the present work was to establish methods for the extraction and quantification of anthocyanin metabolites present in urine, serum and fecal samples. 35 commercial and 10 synthetic analytes, including both known and predicted human and microbial metabolites of anthocyanins were obtained as reference standards. HPLC and MS\/MS conditions were optimized for organic modifier, ionic modifier, mobile phase gradient, flow rate, column type and MS source and compound dependent parameters. The impact of sorbent, solvent, acid, preservative, elution and evaporation on SPE extraction efficiency was also explored. The HPLC-MS\/MS method validation demonstrated acceptable linearity (r2, 0.997 \u00b1 0.002) and sensitivity (LODs: urine, 100 \u00b1 375 nM; serum, 104 \u00b1 358 nM and feces 138 \u00b1 344 nM) and the final SPE methods provided recoveries of 88.3 \u00b1 17.8% for urine, 86.5 \u00b1 11.1% for serum and 80.6 \u00b1 20.9% for feces. Final methods were applied to clinical samples derived from an anthocyanin intervention study, where 36 of the 45 modeled metabolites were detected within urine, plasma or faecal samples. The described methods provide suitable versatility for the identification and quantification of an extensive series of anthocyanin metabolites for use in future clinical studies exploring absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224e","authors":["Rachel M. de Ferrars","de Ferrars RM","Czank C","Saha S","Needs PW","Zhang Q","Raheem KS","Kroon PA","Kay CD"],"doi":"10.1021\/ac500565a","endpage":"10058","first_seen_on":"2014-06-20T14:31:48+00:00","funders":["bbsrc"],"issns":["0003-2700","1520-6882"],"issue":"20","journal":"Analytical Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1403274688,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ac500565a"],"pmid":"24828315","pubdate":"2014-05-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"10052","subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Methods for isolating, identifying and quantifying anthocyanin metabolites in clinical samples.","type":"article","volume":"86","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/methods-isolating-identifying-quantifying-anthocyanin-metabolites-clinical-samples"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3058418,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":938459,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107807,"mean":7.8034135205835,"rank":72137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":25136,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107807,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5069,"mean":2.4216104972376,"rank":2707,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":861,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5069,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":388,"mean":3.4187390180879,"rank":177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":388,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
