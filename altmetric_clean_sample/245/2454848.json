Embryonic wound repair is driven by the evolutionary conserved redistribution of cytoskeletal and junctional proteins around the wound. Drosophila has emerged as a model to screen for factors implicated in wound closure. However, genetic screens have been limited by the use of manual analysis methods. We introduce MEDUSA, a novel image-analysis tool for the automated quantification of multicellular and molecular dynamics from time-lapse confocal microscopy data. We validate MEDUSA by quantifying wound closure in Drosophila embryos, and we show that the results of our automated analysis are comparable to analysis by manual delineation and tracking of the wounds, while significantly reducing the processing time. We demonstrate that MEDUSA can also be applied to the investigation of cellular behaviors in three and four dimensions. Using MEDUSA, we find that the conserved nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Abelson (Abl) contributes to rapid embryonic wound closure. We demonstrate that Abl plays a role in the organization of filamentous actin and the redistribution of the junctional protein \u03b2-catenin at the wound margin during embryonic wound repair. Finally, we discuss different models for the role of Abl in the regulation of actin architecture and adhesion dynamics at the wound margin.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026e9","authors":["Teresa Zulueta-Coarasa","Masako Tamada","Eun J Lee","Rodrigo Fernandez-Gonzalez"],"doi":"10.1242\/dev.106898","first_seen_on":"2014-06-21T10:35:29+00:00","issns":["1477-9129"],"journal":"Development (09501991)","last_mentioned_on":1409998127,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24948602?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dev.biologists.org\/content\/141\/14\/2901","http:\/\/dev.biologists.org\/content\/141\/14\/2901.full","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24948602?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24948602","pubdate":"2014-06-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences"],"subjects":["embryology","biology"],"title":"Automated multidimensional image analysis reveals a role for Abl in embryonic wound repair.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/automated-multidimensional-image-analysis-reveals-role-abl-embryonic-wound-repair"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":1651144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2823626,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107985,"mean":7.8172701511337,"rank":32604,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":74565,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107985,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3165,"mean":4.4208697850822,"rank":1504,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":1635,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3165,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":5.8124444444444,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
