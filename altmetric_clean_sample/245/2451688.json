The mechanisms of action of known \"master\" regulators are still unclear, while the participation of new factors is being revealed. Here, we identify Zbtb20, a Bcl6 homologue, as a novel regulator of late B cell development. Within the B cell lineage, Zbtb20 is specifically expressed in B1 and germinal center B cells and peaks in long-lived bone marrow (BM) ASCs. Unlike Bcl6, an inhibitor of ASC differentiation, ectopic Zbtb20 expression in primary B cells facilitates terminal B cell differentiation to ASCs. In plasma cell lines, Zbtb20 induces cell survival and blocks cell cycle progression. Immunized Zbtb20-deficient mice exhibit curtailed humoral responses and accelerated loss of antigen-specific plasma cells, specifically from the BM pool. Strikingly, Zbtb20 induction does not require Blimp1 but depends directly on Irf4, acting at a newly identified Zbtb20 promoter in ASCs. These results identify Zbtb20 as an important player in late B cell differentiation and provide new insights into this complex process.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c77","authors":["Chevrier S","Emslie D","Shi W","Kratina T","Wellard C","Karnowski A","Erikci E","Smyth GK","Chowdhury K","Tarlinton D","Corcoran LM","St\u00e9phane Chevrier","Dianne Emslie","Wei Shi","Tobias Kratina","Cameron Wellard","Alexander Karnowski","Erdem Erikci","Gordon K.
