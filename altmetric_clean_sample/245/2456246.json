Increasing evidences indicate that miR-744 deregulated in numerous human cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its role in HCC carcinogenesis remains poorly defined. In this study, we investigated the roles of miR-744 in tumor growth of HCC.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007ec","doi":"10.1186\/1475-2867-14-58","first_seen_on":"2014-06-22T11:01:00+00:00","issns":["1475-2867"],"issue":"1","journal":"Cancer Cell International","last_mentioned_on":1403444681,"links":["http:\/\/www.cancerci.com\/content\/14\/1\/58\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cancerci.com\/content\/pdf\/1475-2867-14-58.pdf","pmid":"24991193","pubdate":"2014-06-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"58","title":"Decrease expression of microRNA-744 promotes cell proliferation by targeting c-Myc in human hepatocellular carcinoma","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/decrease-expression-microrna744-promotes-cell-proliferation-targeting-cmyc-human-hepatocellular-carc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2125418,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2234614,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107963,"mean":7.7676364646822,"rank":46973,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":56165,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107963,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":226,"mean":2.0156444444444,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":159,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":226,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.8,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
