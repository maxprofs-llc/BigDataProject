Dynamin-related protein-1 (Drp1) is a GTPase protein that plays a central role in mitochondrial fission. We hypothesized that aerobic exercise training would decrease Drp1 Ser(616) phosphorylation, and increase fat oxidation and insulin sensitivity in obese (BMI: 34.6\u00b10.8 kg\/m(2)) insulin resistant adults. Seventeen subjects performed supervised exercise for 60 min\/d, 5 days\/week at 80-85% of maximal heart rate for 12 weeks. Insulin sensitivity was measured by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and fat oxidation was determined by indirect calorimetry. Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle before and after the 12-week program. The exercise intervention increased insulin sensitivity 2.1\u00b10.2 fold (P<0.01) and fat oxidation 1.3\u00b10.3 fold (P<0.01). Phosphorylation of Drp1 at Ser(616) was decreased (Pre vs. Post: 0.81\u00b10.15 vs. 0.58\u00b10.14, AU P<0.05) following the intervention. Furthermore, reductions in Drp1 Ser(616) phosphorylation were negatively correlated with increases in fat oxidation (r=-0.58, P<0.05) and insulin sensitivity (rho=-0.52, P<0.05). We also examined expression of genes related to mitochondrial dynamics. DNM1L (P<0.01), the gene that codes for Drp1, and OPA1 (P=0.05) were significantly upregulated following the intervention, while there was a trend towards an increase in expression of both MFN1 (P=0.08) and MFN2 (P=0.07). These are the first data to suggest that lifestyle-mediated improvements in substrate metabolism and insulin sensitivity in obese insulin resistant adults may be regulated through decreased activation of the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b71","authors":["Ciaran E Fealy","Anny Mulya","Nicola Lai","John P Kirwan"],"doi":"10.1152\/japplphysiol.01064.2013","first_seen_on":"2014-06-21T18:05:47+00:00","issns":["1522-1601"],"journal":"Journal of Applied Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1406995674,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24947026","http:\/\/jap.physiology.org\/content\/117\/3\/239"],"pmid":"24947026","pubdate":"2014-06-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Exercise training decreases activation of the mitochondrial fission protein dynamin-related protein-1 in insulin-resistant human skeletal muscle","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exercise-training-decreases-activation-mitochondrial-fission-protein-dynaminrelated-protein1-insulin-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4710671,"mean":5.6956590998764,"rank":2341800,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2227001,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4710671,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113070,"mean":8.1498592717723,"rank":51316,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":57457,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113070,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2669,"mean":8.0644835082459,"rank":1632,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":964,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2669,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":22.518764705882,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
