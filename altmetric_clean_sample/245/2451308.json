We have evaluated the effects of two diets on circulating phylloquinone (K1) and triacylglycerols (TAG). One diet was enriched with corn oil (CO) (also rich in gamma-tocopherol) and the other with an olive\/sunflower (O\/SO) mixture (rich in alpha-tocopherol). Effects on gamma-carboxylation were assessed from coagulation assays and sensitive assays for undercarboxylated prothrombin (ucFII) and osteocalcin (ucOC). Total plasma matrix Gla-protein (MGP) was also measured. After an initial adjustment diet, 26 healthy young men were fed, in a crossover design, the O\/SO or CO diet for 2 weeks. Mean intakes of K1 during consumption of adjustment, O\/SO, and CO diets were 225 microg\/day, 291 microg\/day, and 291 microg\/day, respectively. Mean fasting levels of TAG and K1 were both significantly reduced by the CO diet, but not by the O\/SO diet. Neither diet reduced FII activity but ucFII became detectable in nine subjects, eight of whom showed this abnormality with both diets. The CO diet induced a rise in ucOC (P < 0.05), which was negatively correlated to ucFII (r = -0.71, P < 0.03). The CO but not O\/SO diet induced a decrease of total circulating MGP. We conclude that both oils, notably CO, affected vitamin K absorption and\/or metabolism which may increase the requirements for gamma-carboxylation. The mechanism is unclear but may result from interactions of vitamin K with PUFA and\/or other lipid components such as vitamin E.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007d1d","authors":["Leon J.
