The database has been built in partnership with all six (Timor-Leste, Malaysia, Indonesia, The Philippines, Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea) of the Coral Triangle countries, and represents a valuable source of information for natural resource managers at the regional scale. Its utility is demonstrated using biophysical data, data summarising marine habitats, and data describing the extent of marine protected areas in the region.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Annick Cros","Nurulhuda Ahamad Fatan","Alan White","Shwu Jiau Teoh","Stanley Tan","Christian Handayani","Charles Huang","Nate Peterson","Ruben Venegas Li","Hendra Yusran Siry","Ria Fitriana","Jamison Gove","Tomoko Acoba","Maurice Knight","Renerio Acosta","Neil Andrew","Doug Beare","Cros A","Li RV","Kight M","Gove J","Peterson N","Tan S","Handayani C","Teoh SJ","Acosta R","Fitriana R","Ahamad Fatan N","Acoba T","Andrew N","Huang C","White A","Siry HY","Venegas Li R","Knight M","Beare D"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0096332","first_seen_on":"2014-06-20T12:15:10+00:00","handle":"10568\/65692","handles":["10568\/65692"],"issns":["1932-6203",""],"issue":"6","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1455568460,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0096332","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0096332","https:\/\/cgspace.cgiar.org\/handle\/10568\/65692","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0096332"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0096332.pdf","pmid":"24941442","pubdate":"2014-06-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e96332","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"The Coral Triangle Atlas: An Integrated Online Spatial Database System for Improving Coral Reef Management","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/coral-triangle-atlas-integrated-online-spatial-database-system-improving-coral-reef-management"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8399037,"mean":7.0727657654921,"rank":3546262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4799088,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8399037,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179754,"mean":7.5197055070016,"rank":59238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":118992,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179754,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115816,"mean":10.646980270259,"rank":46534,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":67511,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115816,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2890,"mean":14.622483212184,"rank":1276,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":1592,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2890,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":18,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
