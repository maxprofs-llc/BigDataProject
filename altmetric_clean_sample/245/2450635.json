Among these non-coding transcripts, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are the least well-studied but are emerging as key regulators of diverse cellular processes. In the present study, we performed a survey in bovine Longissimus thoraci of lincRNAs (long intergenic non-coding RNAs not overlapping protein-coding transcripts). To our knowledge, this represents the first such study in bovine muscle.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b9","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2164-15-499","first_seen_on":"2014-06-19T21:29:19+00:00","issns":["1471-2164"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1403346160,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/15\/499\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24948191?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2164-15-499.pdf","pmid":"24948191","pubdate":"2014-06-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"499","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Identification of large intergenic non-coding RNAs in bovine muscle using next-generation transcriptomic sequencing.","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-large-intergenic-noncoding-rnas-bovine-muscle-using-nextgeneration-transcriptomic-seq"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":3040827,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":928997,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107488,"mean":7.8585542251624,"rank":70774,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":24199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107488,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4113,"mean":3.4258589494163,"rank":3095,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":555,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4113,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263,"mean":3.2282977099237,"rank":191,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":17,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
