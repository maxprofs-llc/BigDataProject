The results showed that it may not be particularly desirable to present tactile cues (e.g., warning signals) to an interface operator's feet if a speeded foot response is required, for even though such an arrangement maximizes the set-level compatibility between the stimulus and the response, it turns out that response latencies are primarily determined by conduction latencies through the peripheral nervous system.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002165","doi":"10.1016\/j.actpsy.2014.05.014","first_seen_on":"2014-06-20T09:29:59+00:00","issns":["00016918"],"journal":"Acta Psychologica","last_mentioned_on":1403256585,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0001691814001309"],"pmid":"24932995","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"title":"Effectively responding to tactile stimulation: Do homologous cue and effector locations really matter?
