Indeed, the structure of a previously unknown pseudo-polymorphism of a P,P-[3]ferrocenophane was determined via the emerging tool kit of \"NMR crystallography\", where structural inputs and constraints determined by modern solid-state NMR techniques, aided by DFT calculations, are used for faster and more reliable structure solution or refinement of X-ray powder diffraction patterns. Based on this approach it is demonstrated that the observed pseudo polymorphism is related to reversible incorporation of dichloromethane in the crystal structures.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Thomas Wiegand","David L\u00fcdeker","Gunther Brunklaus","Kathrin Bussmann","Gerald Kehr","G Erker","Helmut Eckert","Gerhard Erker","Hellmut Eckert"],"doi":"10.1039\/c4dt01071j","first_seen_on":"2014-06-23T09:10:08+00:00","issns":["1477-9234","1477-9226"],"issue":"33","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1403514594,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2014\/DT\/C4DT01071J"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2014\/dt\/c4dt01071j","pmid":"25010526","pubdate":"2014-07-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"12639","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Polymorphism in P,P-[3]ferrocenophanes: Insights from an NMR crystallographic approach","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/polymorphism-pp3ferrocenophanes-insights-nmr-crystallographic-approach"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":3579164,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":142479,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107885,"mean":7.8221835304589,"rank":83551,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1098,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107885,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992,"mean":0.69031810787136,"rank":2720,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.875,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
