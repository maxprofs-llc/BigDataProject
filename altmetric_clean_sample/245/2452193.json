To clarify the role of iNKT cells in allergic rhinitis (AR), we generated bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), which were pulsed by OVA and \u03b1-galactosylceramide (OVA\/\u03b1-GalCer-BMDCs) and administered into the oral submucosa of OVA-sensitized mice before nasal challenge. Nasal symptoms, level of OVA-specific IgE, and Th2 cytokine production in cervical lymph nodes (CLNs) were significantly ameliorated in wild type (WT) mice treated with OVA\/\u03b1-GalCer-BMDCs, but not in WT mice treated with OVA-BMDCs. These anti-allergic effects were not observed in J\u03b118(-\/-) recipients that lack iNKT cells, even after similar treatment with OVA\/\u03b1-GalCer-BMDCs in an adoptive transfer study with CD4(+) T cells and B cells from OVA-sensitized WT mice. In WT recipients of OVA\/\u03b1-GalCer-BMDCs, the number of IL-21-producing iNKT cells increased significantly and the Th1\/Th2 balance shifted toward the Th1 dominant state. Treatment with anti-IL-21 and anti-IFN-\u03b3 antibodies abrogated these anti-allergic effects in mice treated with \u03b1-GalCer\/OVA-BMDCs. These results suggest that activation of iNKT cells in regional lymph nodes induces anti-allergic effects through production of IL-21 or IFN-\u03b3, and that these effects are enhanced by simultaneous stimulation with antigen. Thus, iNKT cells might be a useful target in development of new treatment strategies for AR.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002548","authors":["Toshioki Sakurai","Ayako Inamine","Tomohisa Iinuma","Urara Funakoshi","Syuji Yonekura","Daiju Sakurai","Toyoyuki Hanazawa","Toshinori Nakayama","Yasuyuki Ishii","Yoshitaka Okamoto"],"doi":"10.1111\/cei.12399","first_seen_on":"2014-06-20T10:13:41+00:00","issns":["1365-2249"],"journal":"Clinical & Experimental Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1403308086,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24943738?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24943738?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24943738","pubdate":"2014-06-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Activation of invariant NKT cells in regional lymph nodes as new antigen-specific immunotherapy via induction of IL-21 and IFN-\u03b3","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/activation-invariant-natural-killer-t-cells-regional-lymph-nodes-new-antigenspecific-immunotherapy-v"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":2006690,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":2992765,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124162,"mean":8.0669971569175,"rank":41703,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":81222,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124162,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1070,"mean":2.9378727782975,"rank":365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":689,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1070,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":3.897619047619,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
