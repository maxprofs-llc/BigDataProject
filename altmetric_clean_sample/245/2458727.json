One hundred and thirty-seven children (96 boys, 41 girls; mean age = 12 years, SD = 1\u00b72) with complete unilateral cleft lip and palate (CUCLP) operated by a single surgeon with a one-stage method were evaluated. The management of the cleft lip and soft palate was comparable in all subjects; for hard palate repair, three different methods were used: bilateral von Langenbeck closure (b-vL group, n = 39), unilateral von Langenbeck closure (u-vL group, n = 56) and vomerplasty (v-p group, n = 42). Speech was assessed: (i) perceptually for the presence of a) hypernasality, b) compensatory articulations (CAs), c) audible nasal air emissions (ANE) and d) speech intelligibility; (ii) for the presence of compensatory facial grimacing, (iii) with clinical intra-oral evaluation and (iv) with videonasendoscopy. A total rate of hypernasality requiring pharyngoplasty was 5\u00b71%; total incidence post-oral compensatory articulations (CAs) was 2\u00b72%. The overall speech intelligibility was good in 84\u00b77% of cases. Oronasal fistulas (ONFs) occurred in 15\u00b77% b-vL subjects, 7\u00b71% u-vL subjects and 50% v-p subjects (P < 0\u00b7001). No statistically significant intergroup differences for hypernasality, CAs and intelligibility were found (P > 0\u00b71). In conclusion, the speech after early one-stage repair of CUCLP was satisfactory. The method of hard palate repair affected the incidence of ONFs, which, however, caused relatively mild and inconsistent speech errors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e9e","authors":["Hortis\u2010Dzierzbicka, M.","Radkowska, E.","Stecko, E.","Dudzinski, L.","Fudalej, P.
