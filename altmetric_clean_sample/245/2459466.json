One HRS-negative cell line (NHIK 3025) and two HRS-positive cell lines (T-47D, T98G) were used. The effects of different pretreatments on HRS were investigated using the colony assay. Cell-based ELISA was used to measure nitric oxide synthase (NOS) levels, and microarray analysis to compare gene expression in primed and unprimed cells. The data show how permanent removal of HRS, previously found to be induced by LDR priming irradiation, can also be induced by addition of nitric oxide (NO)-donor DEANO combined with either high-dose-rate priming or exposure to prolonged cycling hypoxia followed by reoxygenation, a treatment not involving radiation. The removal of HRS appears not to involve DNA damage induced during priming irradiation as it was also induced by LDR irradiation of cell-conditioned medium without cells present. The permanent removal of HRS in LDR-primed cells was reversed by treatment with inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitor 1400W. Furthermore, 1400W could also induce HRS in an HRS-negative cell line. The data suggest that LDR irradiation for 1 h, but not 15 min, activates iNOS, and also that sustained iNOS activation is necessary for the permanent removal of HRS by LDR priming. The data indicate that nitric oxide production is involved in the regulatory processes determining cellular responses to low-dose-rate irradiation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a9c","authors":["Edin NJ","Sandvik JA","Vollan HS","Reger K","G\u00f6rlach A","Pettersen EO"],"doi":"10.1093\/jrr\/rrt061","first_seen_on":"2014-06-24T03:57:38+00:00","issns":["0449-3060"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of radiation research","last_mentioned_on":1403582076,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/23685670\/"],"pmid":"23685670","pubdate":"2013-05-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["radiology","neoplasms","environmentalhealth"],"title":"The role of nitric oxide radicals in removal of hyper-radiosensitivity by priming irradiation.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-nitric-oxide-radicals-removal-hyperradiosensitivity-priming-irradiation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2298197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1613435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107608,"mean":7.8035376137242,"rank":52604,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":39504,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107608,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208,"mean":2.2032560386473,"rank":71,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":94,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.75,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"DK":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/moonslider\/status\/481284229288849410","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2459466],"posted_on":"2014-06-24T03:54:36+00:00","author":{"name":"HOPE","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2980762541\/a989dbc7e8791e81d41781b7b659bb0b_normal.png","description":"RUNNING OUT OF TIME","id_on_source":"moonslider","tweeter_id":"89052670","geo":{"lt":"55.0411666","ln":"9.81038266092285","country":"DK"},"followers":1395},"tweet_id":"481284229288849410"}]}}
