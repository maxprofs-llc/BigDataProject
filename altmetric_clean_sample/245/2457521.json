An experimental design was adopted, and subjects were assigned randomly into an experimental group (n = 55) and a control group (n = 55). In the intervention group comprised of adults, there were no significant variations in blood glucose, blood lipid, blood pressure, heart rate variability, and vital capacity indices. The body weight and body mass index (BMI) dropped in the intervention group. Compared with the control group, the skinfold thicknesses decreased at lower corner of scapula, triceps brachii, and abdomen, with a statistical significance (P < 0.001; P = 0.005; P = 0.003). By comparing the physical fitness indices, it was found that the increase of the results of sit-and-reach test in the intervention group had statistical significance (P = 0.001). In conclusion, it was found by our trial that Baduanjin exercise could significantly improve the physical flexibility and subcutaneous adipose accumulation in the healthy adults.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5243cf058f610003c64","authors":["Li, Ran","Li R","Jin L","Hong P","He ZH","Huang CY"],"doi":"10.1155\/2014\/784059","endpage":"8","first_seen_on":"2014-06-23T07:38:50+00:00","issns":["1741-427X","1741-4288"],"journal":"Evidence-based Complementary & Alternative Medicine (eCAM)","last_mentioned_on":1496229761,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2014\/784059\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25050127","https:\/\/www.omicsonline.org\/references\/the-effect-of-baduanjin-on-promoting-the-physical-fitness-and-health-of-adults-1615801.html"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2014\/784059.pdf","pmcid":"PMC4094699","pmid":"25050127","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","title":"The effect of baduanjin on promoting the physical fitness and health of adults.","type":"article","volume":"2014","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-baduanjin-promoting-physical-fitness-health-adults"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8296164,"mean":6.9911317525872,"rank":770837,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7515601,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8296164,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179134,"mean":7.4844573361694,"rank":19527,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":159406,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179134,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4043,"mean":4.6789762493815,"rank":368,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":3673,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4043,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":17.678,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
