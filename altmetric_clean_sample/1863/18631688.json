We scanned the phantom using the GE Discovery 690 PET\/CT scanner. We varied iteration number and Gaussian filtration. Results were compared for OSEM, OSEM+TOF and OSEM+TOF+PSF reconstructions. A sample of 15 whole-body fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose were reconstructed with OSEM+TOF and OSEM+TOF+PSF using a selection of optimum reconstruction parameters determined in phantom studies. Clinicians qualitatively ranked their preferred images to choose optimum parameters.\nThe addition of PSF improved signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), contrast, hot contrast recovery coefficients and noise over OSEM and OSEM+TOF reconstruction algorithms. SNRs were the highest at two iterations and with 0 or 2\u2009mm filters with OSEM+TOF+PSF reconstruction in all phantom studies. Clinicians generally favoured OSEM+TOF+PSF reconstruction with three iterations and a 2\u2009mm filter.\nPSF reconstruction significantly improved image quality for both clinical and phantom studies. We recommended the optimum reconstruction parameters using three iterations, 24 subsets and a 2\u2009mm filter, which improved SNRs by up to 28.8% for small lesions (P<0.05).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008324","authors":["Vennart, Nicholas J.","Bird, Nicholas","Buscombe, John","Cheow, Heok K.","Nowosinska, Ewa","Heard, Sarah"],"doi":"10.1097\/mnm.0000000000000669","first_seen_on":"2017-04-08T06:44:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0143-3636","1473-5628"],"issue":"6","journal":"Nuclear Medicine Communications","last_mentioned_on":1494948555,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nuclearmedicinecomm\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Optimization_of_PET_CT_image_quality_using_the_GE.98740.aspx","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28394818?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nuclearmedicinecomm\/Abstract\/2017\/06000\/Optimization_of_PET_CT_image_quality_using_the_GE.2.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/nuclearmedicinecomm\/9000\/00000\/Optimization_of_PET_CT_image_quality_using_the_GE.98740.pdf","pmid":"28394818","pubdate":"2017-04-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"471","subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"Optimization of PET\/CT image quality using the GE \u2018Sharp IR\u2019 point-spread function reconstruction algorithm","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nuclearmedicinecomm\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Optimization_of_PET_CT_image_quality_using_the_GE.98740.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/optimization-petct-image-quality-using-ge-sharp-ir-pointspread-function-reconstruction-algorithm"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":1.85,"6m":1.85,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8213437,"mean":6.9553152651275,"rank":3674810,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4447831,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8213437,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242429,"mean":13.058972049433,"rank":106153,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":132720,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242429,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1258,"mean":1.5855529037391,"rank":262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":970,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1258,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":1.2115384615385,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
