The MIC of bedaquiline was determined using the proportion method. To identify genetic determinants of resistance, sequencing of the mmpR ( Rv0678 ), atpE , atpC , pepQ , Rv1979c , rrl , rplC and rplD loci was performed.\nA total of 85 isolates from 27 patients with acquired resistance to linezolid and reduced susceptibility to bedaquiline (MIC \u22650.06\u2009mg\/L) were tested. Most mutations associated with a high MIC of bedaquiline were found in the mmpR gene. We identified for the first time two patients whose clinical isolates had substitutions D28N and A63V in AtpE, which had previously been found only in in vitro -selected strains. Several patients had isolates with elevated MICs of bedaquiline prior to treatment; four of them also bore mutations in mmpR , indicating the presence of some hidden factors in bedaquiline resistance acquisition. The C154R substitution in ribosomal protein L3 was the most frequent in the linezolid-resistant strains. Mutations in the 23S rRNA gene (g2294a and g2814t) associated with linezolid resistance were also found in two isolates. Heteroresistance was identified in \u223c40% of samples, which reflects the complex nature of resistance acquisition.\nThe introduction of novel drugs into treatment must be accompanied by continuous phenotypic susceptibility testing and the analysis of genetic determinants of resistance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c89","authors":["Zimenkov, Danila V","Nosova, Elena Yu","Kulagina, Elena V","Antonova, Olga V","Arslanbaeva, Liaisan R","Isakova, Alexandra I","Krylova, Ludmila Yu","Peretokina, Irina V","Makarova, Marina V","Safonova, Svetlana G","Borisov, Sergey E","Gryadunov, Dmitry A"],"doi":"10.1093\/jac\/dkx094","first_seen_on":"2017-04-08T10:07:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0305-7453","1460-2091"],"journal":"Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (JAC)","last_mentioned_on":1491647305,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28387862?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28387862","pubdate":"2017-04-08T22:02:40+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["drugtherapy"],"title":"OUP accepted manuscript","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/examination-bedaquiline-linezolidresistant-mycobacterium-tuberculosis-isolates-moscow-region"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8019832,"mean":6.784478957969,"rank":5798275,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1936107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8019832,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235504,"mean":12.860752117807,"rank":153506,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":68198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235504,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3326,"mean":5.3493311278195,"rank":2504,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":712,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3326,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71,"mean":12.402,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
