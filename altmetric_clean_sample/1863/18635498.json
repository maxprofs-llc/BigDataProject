The armyworm Mythimna separata (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) of migratory insect is destructive for alimentarn crop and economic crop throughout the world. Here we present the high throughput sequencing of the head transcriptome and identify members of the major sensory genes which are crucial for armyworm's success worldwide, including 8 opsins, 22 chemosensory proteins, 50 odorant binding proteins, 60 odorant receptors, 8 gustatory receptors, 24 ionotropic receptors, and 2 sensory neuron membrane proteins. It is worth noting that a duplication of the LW opsin gene exists in this insect. Several genes were clustered with functionally validated genes, such as Co-receptors of OR and IR, PBPs, PRs, CO2 GRs, bitter GRs and sweet GRs, were also identified. The transcriptome gene library provided the basis for further studies that elucidate the fundamental molecular mechanism of biology and control in M. separata. Our research exhibits the first comprehensive catalogue of the sensory genes fundamental for success and distribution in M. separata, which are potential novel targets for pest control strategies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Liu, Zhenxing","Wang, Xiaoyun","Lei, Chaoliang","Zhu, Fen","Zhenxing Liu","Xiaoyun Wang","Chaoliang Lei","Fen Zhu"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep46033","first_seen_on":"2017-04-08T10:07:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1496148027,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28387246?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28387246","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5384095\/"],"pmid":"28387246","pubdate":"2017-04-08T22:04:20+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological techniques","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Molecular biology","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Sensory genes identification with head transcriptome of the migratory armyworm, Mythimna separata","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sensory-genes-identification-head-transcriptome-migratory-armyworm-mythimna-separata"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8290197,"mean":6.9872012989734,"rank":5994342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2000280,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8290197,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":247616,"mean":12.948405298548,"rank":161692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":71243,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":247616,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35780,"mean":14.716581234803,"rank":24092,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":9873,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35780,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3435,"mean":18.750495631916,"rank":2267,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1000,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3435,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
