Areas covered: This review covers the recent definition and approach to the diagnosis of severe asthma and its differentiation from difficult-to-treat asthma. The recent advances in phenotyping severe asthma and in ensuing changes in management approaches together with the introduction of new therapies are covered from a review of the recent literature. Expert commentary After ascertaining the diagnosis of severe asthma, patients need to be treated adequately with existing therapies. The management approach to severe asthma now comprises of a phenotyping step for the definition of either an allergic or eosinophilic severe asthma for which targeted therapies are currently available. This will lead to a precision medicine approach to the management of severe asthma.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073da","authors":["CHUNG, Kian Fan","Kian Fan Chung"],"doi":"10.1080\/17476348.2017.1317597","first_seen_on":"2017-04-08T12:58:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1747-6348","1747-6356"],"journal":"Expert Review of Respiratory Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1494433455,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28388228?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/17476348.2017.1317597?af=R","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/17476348.2017.1317597?ai=1lf9m&mi=ianpxd&af=R","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/pdf\/10.1080\/17476348.2017.1317597","http:\/\/tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/17476348.2017.1317597?af=R"],"pmid":"28388228","pubdate":"2017-04-08T22:01:44+00:00","publisher":"Informa UK Limited","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Clinical management of severe therapy-resistant asthma","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-management-severe-therapyresistant-asthma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8183187,"mean":6.9217013823156,"rank":3855589,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4145434,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8183187,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241404,"mean":13.05001671893,"rank":114922,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":119309,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241404,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":400,"mean":2.3026315789474,"rank":123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":400,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":2.6147058823529,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
