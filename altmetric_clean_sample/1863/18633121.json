It comprises Cinnamomum bejolghota, Cinnamomum parthenoxylon, and Aquilaria crassna. The aim of this study is to evaluate the beneficial properties of TSP tea consumption on blood glucose regulation and serum lipid profiles of healthy overweight volunteers. This open-label, randomized controlled trial was conducted in 70 healthy overweight adults. Two groups of 35 subjects took a TSP infusion or a placebo (cornstarch) twice daily for 8 weeks. The blood glucose regulation, serum lipid profiles, BMI, and liver function tests of the subjects were determined at the baseline, 4th week, and endpoint (8th week). Significant decreases in the average fasting levels of total cholesterol (p = 0.013), triglyceride (p = 0.001), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL, p = 0.017) were observed in the TSP group at the 8th week compared to those at the baseline. The average HDL level in the TSP group at the beginning of the study was 65.2\u2009mg\/dL, and it increased significantly (p = 0.005) to 72.4\u2009mg\/dL after 8 weeks of TSP intake. This study showed that the intake of TSP tea as an antioxidant-rich beverage might be safe and improve lipid profiles in overweight adults.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5243cf058f610003c64","authors":["Kuamsub, Sirigoon"],"doi":"10.1155\/2017\/2687173","first_seen_on":"2017-04-08T08:05:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1741-427X","1741-4288"],"journal":"Evidence-based Complementary & Alternative Medicine (eCAM)","last_mentioned_on":1492930869,"links":["https:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2017\/2687173\/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2017\/2687173.pdf","pmcid":"PMC5397647","pmid":"28484502","pubdate":"2017-04-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Improved Lipid Profile Associated with Daily Consumption of Tri-Sura-Phon in Healthy Overweight Volunteers: An Open-Label, Randomized Controlled Trial","type":"article","volume":"2017","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/improved-lipid-profile-associated-daily-consumption-trisuraphon-healthy-overweight-volunteers-openla"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8091674,"mean":6.8840357008911,"rank":6144979,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1086598,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8091674,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238790,"mean":12.98962744515,"rank":170415,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":43205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238790,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3978,"mean":4.6790912748303,"rank":2318,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1155,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3978,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113,"mean":1.3348214285714,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/lolitsjournals\/statuses\/850620498018828288","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18633121],"posted_on":"2017-04-08T08:05:05+00:00","author":{"name":"lolitsjournals","url":"http:\/\/keeganmclean.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/652288661413695488\/TMbtKL-d_normal.jpg","description":"Current journals on all things Chiropractic.
