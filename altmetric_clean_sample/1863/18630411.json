An alternative approach is autologous fat grafting (AFG) of the posterior pharyngeal wall. About 5% of the population has internal carotid arteries (ICA) with an aberrant course. This anatomic variation can be responsible for surgical difficulties while when performing a velopharyngoplasty, and therefore lead surgeons to only consider a speech reeducation of VPI. However, AFG is does not bear such surgical morbidity.\nThe aim of this study is to retrospectively determine AFG efficiency on VPI in patients with aberrant ICA's courses who cannot benefit from a velopharyngoplasty, by comparing pre- and postoperative Borel Maisonny score (BMS) and intelligibility (Intell).\nWe conducted a retrospective study in 2 centers, including children with VPI and aberrant ICA's courses who underwent an AFG of the posterior pharyngeal wall from 2004 to 2015, in addition to speech therapy.\nNine patients (4-11 years old) underwent the surgical procedure, 8 of them presenting a 22q11 microdeletion. All improved their VPI by AFG of the pharyngeal wall according to BMS and Intelligibility after a 10 months follow-up. The effect was stable after 3 years of follow-up. No severe complication (apnea, vascular injury) occured.\nAFG of the pharyngeal wall, associated with speech therapy, seems to be a safe procedure for patients with VIP and aberrant ICA's courses. Multiple procedures are possible if needed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b88","authors":["Emilie Bois","Charlotte Celerier","Kahina Belhous","Michel Maulet","Nicolas Leboulanger","No\u00ebl
