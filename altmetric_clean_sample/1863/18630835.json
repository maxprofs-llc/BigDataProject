Esophageal stenosis is closely associated with quasi-circumferential ESD. We examined whether post-ESD esophageal stricture can be prevented by grafting an acellular dermal matrix (ADM) membrane.\nFourteen Bama miniature pigs were randomly divided into an ADM group (n=7) and a control group (n=7). Semi-circumferential ESD was performed at the distal esophagus in all animals, and in the ADM group, an ADM patch graft was placed at the resection site and secured innovatively with metal clips. Animals in the control group underwent ESD only. Endoscopy was performed at 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks post-ESD and fluoroscopy was performed at 4 weeks for assessment of the degree of stenosis, after which the remodeled esophageal tissues were excised for histological analysis.\nNo animals in the ADM group developed clinically significant esophageal stenosis, whereas 42.8% (3\/7) in the control group did. The degree of stenosis was severe in the control group (39.8% vs 17.2%, respectively) (P=0.01). Animals in the ADM group had less feeding difficulty and lost less weight (-0.9 kg vs -4.1 kg, respectively) (P=0.007). Histologically, complete mucosal epithelium, slight local inflammation, and organized collagenous fibers were observed in the ADM group.\nADM patch graft appears, after short-term observation, to be a potentially useful new treatment strategy for prevention of esophageal stricture after ESD. A metal clip fixation technique is effective for endoscopic graft attachment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f6100058f7","authors":["Han, Ye","Guo, Jintao","Sun, Siyu","Wu, Weichao","Wang, Sheng","Ge, Nan","Liu, Xiang","Wang, Guoxin","Wang, Shupeng","Ye Han","Jintao Guo","Siyu Sun","Weichao Wu","Sheng Wang","Nan Ge","Xiang Liu","Guoxin Wang","Shupeng Wang"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.gie.2017.02.038","first_seen_on":"2017-04-08T06:07:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0016-5107","00165107","1097-6779"],"journal":"Gastrointestinal Endoscopy","last_mentioned_on":1491631632,"links":["http:\/\/www.giejournal.org\/article\/S0016-5107(17)31776-5\/fulltext?rss=yes&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.giejournal.org\/article\/S0016-5107(17)31776-5\/fulltext?rss=yes&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pmid":"28396274","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["diagnosticimaging","gastroenterology"],"title":"Acellular dermal matrix for esophageal stricture prevention after endoscopic submucosal dissection in a porcine model","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/acellular-dermal-matrix-esophageal-stricture-prevention-after-endoscopic-submucosal-dissection-porci"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8019832,"mean":6.784478957969,"rank":6083876,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1079292,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8019832,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235504,"mean":12.860786724585,"rank":167318,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":43106,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235504,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2338,"mean":3.4182635857938,"rank":1541,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":426,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2338,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":129,"mean":2.54296875,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":129,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
