The ferroelastic domain switching and the lattice deformation of both a-domains and c-domains under an applied electric field were investigated using in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction in conjunction with a high-speed pulse generator set up for epitaxial (100)\/(001)-oriented tetragonal Pb(Zr0.4Ti0.6)O3 (PZT) films grown on (100) c SrRuO3\/\/(100)KTaO3 substrates. The 004 peak (c-domain) position shifts to a lower 2\u03b8 angle, which demonstrates the elongation of the c-axis lattice parameter of the c-domain under an applied electric field. In contrast, the 400 peak (a-domain) shifts in the opposite direction (higher angle), thus indicating a decrease in the a-axis lattice parameter of the a-domain. 90\u00b0 domain switching from (100) to (001) orientations (from a-domain to c-domain) was observed by a change in the intensities of the 400 and 004 diffraction peaks by applying a high-speed pulsed electric field 200\u2009ns in width. This change also accompanied a tilt in the angles of each domain from the substrate surface normal direction. This behaviour proved that the 90\u00b0 domain switched within 40\u2009ns under a high-speed pulsed electric field. Direct observation of such high-speed switching opens the way to design piezo-MEMS devices for high-frequency operation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Yoshitaka Ehara","Shintaro Yasui","Takahiro Oikawa","Takahisa Shiraishi","Takao Shimizu","Hiroki Tanaka","Noriyuki Kanenko","Ronald Maran","Tomoaki Yamada","Yasuhiko Imai","Osami Sakata","Nagarajan Valanoor","Hiroshi Funakubo"],"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-017-09389-6","first_seen_on":"2017-08-29T11:09:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2045-2322"],"issue":"1","journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1504860212,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/doi:10.1038\/s41598-017-09389-6","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/s41598-017-09389-6"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-09389-6.pdf","pmid":"28851927","pubdate":"2017-08-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","startpage":"9641","subjects":["science"],"title":"In-situ observation of ultrafast 90\u00b0 domain switching under application of an electric field in (100)\/(001)-oriented tetragonal epitaxial Pb(Zr0.4Ti0.6)O3 thin films","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/insitu-observation-ultrafast-90-domain-switching-under-application-electric-field-100001oriented-tet"},"altmetric_score":{"score":68,"score_history":{"1y":68,"6m":68,"3m":68,"1m":68,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":68},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8386076,"mean":7.0651873001299,"rank":136137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":8249897,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8386076,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":139725,"mean":12.415761758896,"rank":5244,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":134475,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":139725,"percentile":96},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37205,"mean":14.723118696914,"rank":1770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":35433,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37205,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3099,"mean":12.580224015494,"rank":117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":2981,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3099,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
