Here we describe p53-dependent control of the rate-limiting enzyme in the pyrimidine catabolic pathway, dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD) and its effect on pharmacokinetics of and response to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Using in silico\/chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis we identify a conserved p53 DNA-binding site (p53BS) downstream of the DPYD gene with increased p53 occupancy following 5-FU\u00a0treatment of cells. Consequently, decrease in Histone H3K9AC and increase in H3K27me3 marks at the DPYD promoter are observed concomitantly with reduced expression of DPYD mRNA and protein in a p53-dependent manner. Mechanistic studies reveal inhibition of DPYD expression by p53 is augmented following thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibition and DPYD repression by p53 is dependent on DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) signaling. In-vivo, liver specific Tp53 loss increases the conversion of 5-FU to 5-FUH2 in plasma and elicits a diminished 5-FU therapeutic response in a\u00a0syngeneic colorectal tumor model consistent with increased DPYD-activity. Our data suggest that p53 plays an important role in controlling pyrimidine catabolism through repression of DPYD expression, following metabolic stress imposed by nucleotide imbalance. These findings have implications for the toxicity and efficacy of the cancer therapeutic 5-FU.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Prashanth Gokare","Niklas K.
