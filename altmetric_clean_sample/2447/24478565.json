Moreover, message recipients' prior knowledge may moderate these relationships.\nThis study used the elaboration likelihood model to determine the main effects of argument quality, source credibility and the moderating effect of self-reported diabetes knowledge on message attitudes.\nA between-subjects experimental design using an educational message concerning diabetes for manipulation was applied to validate the effects empirically. A total of 181 participants without diabetes were recruited from the Department of Health, Taipei City Government. Four group messages were manipulated in terms of argument quality (high and low) \u00d7 source credibility (high and low).\nArgument quality and source credibility of health information significantly influenced the attitude of message recipients. The participants with high self-reported knowledge participants exhibited significant disapproval for messages with low argument quality.\nEffective health information should provide objective descriptions and cite reliable sources; in addition, it should provide accurate, customised messages for recipients who have high background knowledge level and ability to discern message quality.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029c0","authors":["Lin, Tung\u2010Cheng","Hwang, Lih\u2010Lian","Lai, Yung\u2010Jye"],"doi":"10.1111\/hir.12181","first_seen_on":"2017-08-29T12:15:45+00:00","issns":["14711834"],"journal":"Health Information & Libraries Journal","last_mentioned_on":1504008932,"links":["http:\/\/www.ingentaconnect.com\/content\/bsc\/hir\/2017\/00000034\/00000003\/art00005"],"pmid":"28513005","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Library And Information Studies","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Health Professions","Social Sciences"],"subjects":["healthservices","medicalinformatics"],"title":"Effects of argument quality, source credibility and self-reported diabetes knowledge on message attitudes: an experiment using diabetes related messages","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-argument-quality-source-credibility-selfreported-diabetes-knowledge-message-attitudes-experi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":6408585,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1148408,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172012,"mean":12.479372505247,"rank":121699,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":31483,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172012,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":314,"mean":5.422875399361,"rank":273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":314,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":6.57,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1,"Business, Management and Accounting":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/mzarro\/statuses\/902504992451506177","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24478565],"posted_on":"2017-08-29T12:15:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Mike Zarro","url":"http:\/\/www.mikezarro.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/769180207043469313\/mgozNztG_normal.jpg","description":"UX Pro","id_on_source":"mzarro","tweeter_id":"9796892","geo":{"lt":39.95234,"ln":-75.16379,"country":"US"},"followers":479},"tweet_id":"902504992451506177"}]}}
