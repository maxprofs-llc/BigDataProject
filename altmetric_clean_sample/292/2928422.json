Intriguingly, changes in R-loop dynamics have also been associated with DNA damage accumulation and genome instability; however, the mechanisms underlying R-loop-induced DNA damage remain unknown. Here we demonstrate in human cells that R-loops induced by the absence of\u00a0diverse RNA processing factors, including the RNA\/DNA helicases Aquarius (AQR) and Senataxin (SETX), or by the inhibition of topoisomerase I, are actively processed into DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by the nucleotide excision repair endonucleases XPF and XPG. Surprisingly, DSB formation requires the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) factor Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB), but not the global genome repair protein XPC. These findings reveal an unexpected and potentially deleterious role for TC-NER factors in driving R-loop-induced DNA damage and genome instability.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037ba","authors":["Sollier J","Stork CT","Garc\u00eda-Rubio ML","Paulsen RD","Aguilera A","Cimprich KA"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.molcel.2014.10.020","first_seen_on":"2014-11-27T00:05:24+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["1097-2765","10972765"],"journal":"Molecular Cell","last_mentioned_on":1429810327,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cell.com%2Fmolecular-cell%2Fabstract%2FS1097-2765%252814%252900830-2&code=cell-site","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1097276514008302","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.molcel.2014.10.020","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25435140?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25435140?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S1097276514008302\/pdf","pmid":"25435140","pubdate":"2014-11-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"Transcription-Coupled Nucleotide Excision Repair Factors Promote R-Loop-Induced Genome Instability.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transcriptioncoupled-nucleotide-excision-repair-factors-promote-rloopinduced-genome-instability"},"altmetric_score":{"score":16.834,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":16.834},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5030595,"mean":5.9580219135188,"rank":281288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":4749301,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5030595,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171937,"mean":8.0322367625164,"rank":13263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":158674,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171937,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3172,"mean":5.83046799117,"rank":212,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":2960,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3172,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":11.620913043478,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Researcher":44,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
