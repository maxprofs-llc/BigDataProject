Patients younger than 24 months of age more commonly present with risk organ (liver, spleen, hematopoietic system, or lung) involvement at diagnosis and have a poor prognosis. Treatment approaches have changed over the last 25 years. Our goal was to describe the course and outcomes of patients younger than 24 months of age at diagnosis and identify the role of bone involvement in outcomes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dd4","doi":"10.1097\/bpo.0000000000000218","first_seen_on":"2014-11-26T03:56:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0271-6798"],"issue":"8","journal":"Journal of Pediatric Orthopaedics","last_mentioned_on":1416974123,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/pedorthopaedics\/Abstract\/2014\/12000\/Outcomes_of_Children_Younger_Than_24_Months_With.15.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/pedorthopaedics\/2014\/12000\/Outcomes_of_Children_Younger_Than_24_Months_With.15.pdf","pmid":"25387157","pubdate":"2014-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"825","subjects":["orthopedics","pediatrics"],"title":"Outcomes of Children Younger Than 24 Months With Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis and Bone Involvement: A Report From a Single Institution","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/outcomes-children-younger-24-months-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis-bone-involvement-report-single-ins-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4771353,"mean":5.7199972209166,"rank":3380716,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":776142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4771353,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160054,"mean":8.143085090564,"rank":108378,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":33071,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160054,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1338,"mean":1.9597651458489,"rank":852,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1338,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":1.8431818181818,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":3,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Psychology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JofPedOrtho\/status\/537454545597526016","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2925330],"posted_on":"2014-11-26T03:55:23+00:00","author":{"name":"JofPedOrthopaedics","url":"http:\/\/pedorthopaedics.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1611346129\/JPO_Cover_-_Twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Official Journal of the Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America and European Paediatric Orthopaedic Society","id_on_source":"JofPedOrtho","tweeter_id":"400363293","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":91},"tweet_id":"537454545597526016"}]}}
