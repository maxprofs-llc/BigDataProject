Epidemiological data on very low birth weight infants shows that the predominant pathogens of neonatal LOS are coagulase-negative staphylococci, followed by Gram-negative bacilli and fungi. Due to the difficulties in a prompt diagnosis of LOS and LOS-associated high risk of mortality and long-term neurodevelopmental sequelae, empirical antibiotic treatment is initiated on suspicion of LOS. However, empirical therapy is often inappropriately used with unnecessary broad-spectrum antibiotics and a prolonged duration of treatment. The increasing number of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative micro-organisms in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) worldwide is a serious concern, which requires thorough and efficient surveillance strategies and appropriate treatment regimens. Immunological strategies for preventing neonatal LOS are not supported by current evidence, and approaches, such as a strict hygiene protocol and the minimisation of invasive procedures in NICUs represent the cornerstone to reduce the burden of neonatal LOS.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002304","authors":["Ying Dong","Christian P Speer"],"doi":"10.1136\/archdischild-2014-306213","first_seen_on":"2014-11-25T17:44:41+00:00","issns":["1468-2052"],"journal":"Archives of Disease in Childhood -- Fetal & Neonatal Edition","last_mentioned_on":1431698057,"links":["http:\/\/fn.bmj.com\/cgi\/content\/short\/archdischild-2014-306213v1?rss=1&fb_ref=Default&fb_source=message","http:\/\/fn.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2014\/11\/25\/archdischild-2014-306213.full?sid=1696c521-0832-4d0c-b1af-92144a206b46","http:\/\/fn.bmj.com\/cgi\/content\/short\/100\/3\/F257?rss=1","http:\/\/fn.bmj.com\/content\/100\/3\/F257.short?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/fn.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2014\/11\/25\/archdischild-2014-306213.full.pdf","pmid":"25425653","pubdate":"2014-11-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd and Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"fetalneonatal-2014-306213","subjects":["perinatology","pediatrics"],"title":"Late-onset neonatal sepsis: recent developments","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lateonset-neonatal-sepsis-recent-developments-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5099351,"mean":6.0430677784442,"rank":2694276,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1740629,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5099351,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174912,"mean":7.9719702934637,"rank":87785,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":66610,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174912,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":709,"mean":4.4245508474576,"rank":434,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":184,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":709,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":7.0837333333333,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
