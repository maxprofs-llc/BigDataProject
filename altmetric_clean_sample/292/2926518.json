In this study, we explored the clinical significance, transcriptional regulation and direct target of miR-122 in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Reduced expression of miR-122 in patients with HBV-associated HCC was correlated with venous invasion, and poor prognosis. Furthermore, UDP-N-acetyl-\u03b1-D-galactosamine polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyl- transferase-10 (GALNT10) was identified as a bona fide target of miR-122 in hepatoma cells. Ectopic expression and knockdown studies showed that GALNT10 indeed promotes proliferation and apoptosis resistance of hepatoma cells in a glycosyltransferase-dependent manner. Critically, adverse correlation between miR-122 and GALNT10, a poor prognosticator of clinical outcome, was demonstrated in hepatoma patients. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4\u03b1 (Hnf4\u03b1), a liver-enriched transcription factor that activates miR-122 gene transcription, was suppressed in HBV-infected hepatoma cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) assay showed significantly reduced association of Hnf4\u03b1 with the miR-122 promoter in HBV infected hepatoma cells. Moreover, GALNT10 was found to intensified O-glycosylation and following signal activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In addition, in a therapeutic perspective, we proved that GALNT10 silencing increases sensitivity to sorafenib and doxorubicin challenge. In summary, our results reveal a novel Hnf4\u03b1\/miR-122\/GALNT10 regulatory pathway that facilitates EGFR activation and hepatoma growth in HBV-associated hepatocarcinogenesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Qian Wu","Hai-Ou Liu","Yi-Dong Liu","Wei-Si Liu","Deng Pan","Wei-Juan Zhang","Liu Yang","Qiang Fu","Jie-Jie Xu","Jian-Xin Gu"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m114.601203","first_seen_on":"2014-11-26T13:01:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1083-351X"],"journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1417009113,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25422324?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25422324","pubdate":"2014-11-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Decreased expression of Hnf4\u03b1\/miR-122 axis in hepatitis B virus-associated hepatocellular carcinoma enhances potential oncogenic GALNT10 activity.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/decreased-expression-hepatocyte-nuclear-factor-4-hnf4microrna122-mir122-axis-hepatitis-b-virusassoci"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4553834,"mean":5.3241366058634,"rank":3114765,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":863060,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4553834,"percentile":18},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145273,"mean":8.1924392312353,"rank":96973,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":31459,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145273,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30314,"mean":2.5262254478277,"rank":23277,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":5141,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30314,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":331,"mean":2.3856484848485,"rank":197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":331,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
