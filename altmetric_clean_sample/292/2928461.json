Read abstract @ACRheum"],"citation":{"abstract":"Objectives: Family history of RA is one of the strongest risk factors for developing RA, and is therefore routinely collected in clinical practice. However, as more genetic and environmental risk factors shared by relatives are identified, the importance of family history might diminish. We aimed to test how much of the RA familial risk could be explained by established genetic and non-genetic risk factors. Methods: RA disease history in first degree relatives of individuals in the EIRA case-control study was assessed through linkage to the Swedish Multi-Generation and Patient registers. We used logistic regression models to investigate the decrease in familial risk after successive adjustment for combinations of non-genetic (smoking, alcohol intake, parity, silica exposure, BMI, fatty fish consumption, socio-economic status) and genetic (shared epitope (SE) and 76 SNPs) risk factors. Results: Established non-genetic risk factors did not explain any significant part of the familial risk in either seropositive or -negative RA. Genetic risk factors explained a limited proportion of the familial risk for seropositive RA (Family history ORCrude =4.10, ORAdjusted for SE =3.72, ORAdjusted for 76SNPs =3.46, ORAdjusted for both =3.35). Conclusion: Established risk factors only explained a minor part of the familial risk of RA, suggesting that many (and familial) risk factors remain to be identified, in particular for seronegative RA. Family history of RA thus remains an important clinical risk factor for RA that currently cannot be substituted with other information. There is thus a need for further etiologic studies in both seropositive and seronegative RA. \u00a9 2014 American College of Rheumatology.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"53222bcf2a83eefa4a8b456f","authors":["Jiang, Xia","Frisell, Thomas","Askling, Johan","Karlson, Elizabeth W.","Klareskog, Lars","Alfredsson, Lars","K\u00e4llberg, Henrik"],"doi":"10.1002\/art.38927","endpage":"362","first_seen_on":"2014-11-27T00:31:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["2326-5205","2326-5191"],"issue":"2","journal":"Arthritis & Rheumatology","last_mentioned_on":1423158353,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/art.38927\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25418518"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/art.38927\/pdf","pmid":"25418518","pubdate":"2015-01-28T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"352","title":"To which extent may the familial risk of rheumatoid arthritis be explained by established RA risk factors?","type":"article","volume":"67","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/extent-familial-risk-rheumatoid-arthritis-explained-established-rheumatoid-arthritis-risk-factors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6394888,"mean":5.9820632261367,"rank":2120364,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4254203,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6394888,"percentile":66},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":200770,"mean":7.7204343200396,"rank":60356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":139319,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":200770,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":479,"mean":8.6155481171548,"rank":178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":297,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":479,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":11.16431884058,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
