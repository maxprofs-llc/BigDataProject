The current meta-analysis aimed to provide a thorough, quantitative examination of the associations between PTS and several aspects of ER. A search of the PsychINFO database resulted in 2557 titles, of which 57 met full inclusion criteria (the cross-sectional association between PTS symptoms and ER was reported, participants were 18 years or older, the article was written in English, and sufficient information was reported to calculate effect sizes). From the 57 studies that were included, 74 effect sizes were obtained. All studies were independently coded by two of the study authors for the following: citation, sample type, total N size (and group n's if applicable), mean age of participants, type of traumatic event, study design, PTS measure(s), ER measure(s), and effect size information. Eight random effects models were conducted: seven for individual ER strategies (e.g., rumination) and one for general emotion dysregulation. The largest effects were observed for general emotion dysregulation (r\u00a0=\u00a00.53; k\u00a0=\u00a013), rumination (r\u00a0=\u00a00.51; k\u00a0=\u00a05), thought suppression (r\u00a0=\u00a00.47; k\u00a0=\u00a013), and experiential avoidance (r\u00a0=\u00a00.40; k\u00a0=\u00a020). Medium effects were observed for expressive suppression (r\u00a0=\u00a00.29; k\u00a0=\u00a03) and worry (r\u00a0=\u00a00.28; k\u00a0=\u00a06). Significant effects were not observed for acceptance or reappraisal. Moderator analyses (sample and trauma type) were conducted for general emotion dysregulation, experiential avoidance, and thought suppression; no significant differences were observed. Findings from the current analysis suggest that several aspects of ER are associated with PTS symptoms across a variety of samples. Additionally, the current study highlights a number of limitations in the existing ER and PTS symptom literature.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4da3cf058f610001642","authors":["Antonia V.
