In this paper, we propose a natural generalization of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm that allows for parallelizing a single chain using existing MCMC methods. We do so by proposing multiple points in parallel, then constructing and sampling from a finite-state Markov chain on the proposed points such that the overall procedure has the correct target density as its stationary distribution. Our approach is generally applicable and straightforward to implement. We demonstrate how this construction may be used to greatly increase the computational speed and statistical efficiency of a variety of existing MCMC methods, including Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithms and Adaptive MCMC. Furthermore, we show how it allows for a principled way of using every integration step within Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods; our approach increases robustness to the choice of algorithmic parameters and results in increased accuracy of Monte Carlo estimates with little extra computational cost.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Ben Calderhead"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.1408184111","first_seen_on":"2014-11-27T07:52:07+00:00","issns":["0027-8424","1091-6490"],"issue":"49","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1461215432,"links":["http:\/\/m.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2014\/11\/20\/1408184111.abstract.html?etoc=","http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2014\/11\/20\/1408184111.abstract","http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/111\/49\/17408.long","http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/111\/49\/17408.full","http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/111\/49\/17408.full.pdf","http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/111\/49\/17408.full.pdf+html","http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/111\/49\/17408.abstract","http:\/\/m.pnas.org\/content\/111\/49\/17408.full.pdf"],"pmid":"25422442","pubdate":"2014-11-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"201408184","subjects":["science"],"title":"A general construction for parallelizing Metropolis\u2212Hastings algorithms","type":"article","volume":"111","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/general-construction-parallelizing-metropolishastings-algorithms"},"altmetric_score":{"score":28.932,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":28.932},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7584550,"mean":6.538792679956,"rank":260387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":7324188,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7584550,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233150,"mean":7.3857017443782,"rank":10182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":222968,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233150,"percentile":95},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44374,"mean":22.592267640232,"rank":6395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":37978,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44374,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":954,"mean":46.718682056663,"rank":300,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":654,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":954,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":8},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":8,"Members of the public":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":32,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
