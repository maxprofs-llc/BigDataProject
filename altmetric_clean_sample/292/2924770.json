Subjects were examined within 5 days from the start of illness and 6 weeks after. On day 1, the reproducibility of PC20 was assessed by 2 consecutive inhalation challenges 1 h apart; the two values were closely related (r = 0.96, p less than 0.001). Five subjects had bronchial hyperresponsiveness (PC20 less than 8 mg\/ml histamine). On the following day, PC20 was measured before and 1 h after oral intake of 2 g ascorbic acid. Vitamin C produced a significant increase in average PC20 (p less than 0.01) from 7.8 +\/- (SE) 1.2 to 25.1 +\/- (SE) 1.2 mg\/ml. None had airway hyperresponsiveness after treatment. Six weeks after the onset of URI, bronchial responsiveness was normal in all the subjects but one. The mean PC20 was 15.5 +\/- (SE) 1.25 mg\/ml, significantly higher than during URI (p less than 0.05); after ascorbic acid it increased nonsignificantly to 25.7 +\/- (SE) 1.35 mg\/ml. Our results indicate that vitamin C inhibits the transient increase in bronchial responsiveness occurring in otherwise normal subjects during URI.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003470","authors":["C Bucca","G Rolla","W Arossa","E Caria","C Elia","F Nebiolo","S Baldi"],"first_seen_on":"2014-11-26T01:15:12+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0025-7931"],"issue":"4","journal":"Respiration","last_mentioned_on":1416964441,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2595105"],"pmid":"2595105","pubdate":"1989-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Effect of ascorbic acid on increased bronchial responsiveness during upper airway infection.","type":"article","volume":"55","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-ascorbic-acid-increased-bronchial-responsiveness-during-upper-airway-infection"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4553834,"mean":5.3241366058634,"rank":3690822,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":139985,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4553834,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145275,"mean":8.1969346063302,"rank":113815,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1448,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145275,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267,"mean":1.7059323308271,"rank":193,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.3791666666667,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
