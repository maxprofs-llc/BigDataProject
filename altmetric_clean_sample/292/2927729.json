These hybrid quantum systems hold great promise for quantum information-processing applications; even more strikingly, they enable exploration of new physical regimes. Here we study theoretically the new physics emerging when a quantum electronic conductor is exposed to nonclassical microwaves (for example, squeezed states, Fock states). We study this interplay in the experimentally relevant situation where a superconducting microwave cavity is coupled to a conductor in the tunnelling regime. We find that the conductor acts as a nontrivial probe of the microwave state: the emission and absorption of photons by the conductor is characterized by a nonpositive definite quasi-probability distribution, which is related to the Glauber-Sudarshan P-function of quantum optics. These negative quasi-probabilities have a direct influence on the conductance of the conductor.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["J. -R. Souquet","M.
