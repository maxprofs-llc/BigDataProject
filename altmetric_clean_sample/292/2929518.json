Adaptive thresholding is used to extract an incomplete edge map from the image. Then, seed points are created on a rectangular grid. Rays are cast from each point to identify the local grain. The grain with the best shape is selected by energy minimization, and the grain is used to update the edge map. This is repeated until all the grains have been recognized. Tests on scanning electron microscope images of titanium oxide and aluminium oxide show that their process achieves better results than five other contour detection techniques.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e58","authors":["LEE, H.\u2010G.","CHOI, M.\u2010K.","LEE, S.\u2010C."],"doi":"10.1111\/jmi.12188","endpage":"103","first_seen_on":"2014-11-27T10:18:46+00:00","issns":["1365-2818","0022-2720"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Microscopy","last_mentioned_on":1417083467,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jmi.12188\/abstract;jsessionid=AB718AD179542E4D9970DFF4F44BD305.f02t01"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jmi.12188\/pdf","pmid":"25430498","pubdate":"2014-11-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Condensed Matter Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Materials Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"92","subjects":["diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Grain\u2010oriented segmentation of images of porous structures using ray casting and curvature energy minimization","type":"article","volume":"257","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/grainoriented-segmentation-images-porous-structures-using-ray-casting-curvature-energy-minimization"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6276546,"mean":5.9870228254566,"rank":2952465,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1873965,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6276546,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193739,"mean":7.7626367052412,"rank":95710,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":74780,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193739,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319,"mean":1.7898805031447,"rank":142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":125,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.1708333333333,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Computer Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bertrand_simon\/status\/537913166961733632","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2929518],"posted_on":"2014-11-27T10:17:47+00:00","author":{"name":"Bertrand SIMON","url":"http:\/\/uha.academia.edu\/BertrandSIMON","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3286328849\/66b01d0cf20a9948fa6aa8b608007483_normal.jpeg","description":"Ma\u00eetre de Conf\u00e9rences \u00e0 l'#UHA , facult\u00e9 de Sciences et Techniques.
