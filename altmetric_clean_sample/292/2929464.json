These differences might cause anxiety, confusion and misperceptions in some ambulant patients with psychoses\/schizophrenia, especially if the brand atypical antipsychotic is substituted in the pharmacy without the acknowledgement of the patient and treating psychiatrist. Furthermore, generic substitution of branded oral atypical antipsychotics in the pharmacy might cause nonadherence and potentially lead to suboptimal treatment outcomes if patients perceive the medicines to be clinically different.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002585","authors":["Roman B"],"doi":"10.2165\/00023210-200923080-00006","first_seen_on":"2014-11-27T09:54:29+00:00","issns":["1172-7047"],"issue":"8","journal":"CNS Drugs","last_mentioned_on":1417082038,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19594198"],"pmid":"19594198","pubdate":"2009-07-15T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurology","pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Patients' attitudes towards generic substitution of oral atypical antipsychotics: a questionnaire-based survey in a hypothetical pharmacy setting.","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/patients-attitudes-towards-generic-substitution-oral-atypical-antipsychotics-questionnairebased-surv"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4557340,"mean":5.3372681568235,"rank":3693381,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":140420,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4557340,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145934,"mean":8.1611444018831,"rank":114321,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1472,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145934,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":470,"mean":3.2540895522388,"rank":384,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":470,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.7714285714286,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
