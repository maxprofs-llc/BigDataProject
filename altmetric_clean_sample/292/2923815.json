Specifically, the ability of platelets to recognize and respond to infectious agents is an important area of investigation. To understand the physiological roles of platelets in vivo, most researchers have used antibody-mediated platelet depletion, which has certain limitations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f7e","authors":["Leah M Wuescher","Akira Takashima","Randall G Worth"],"doi":"10.1111\/jth.12795","first_seen_on":"2014-11-25T18:02:28+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi","phs"],"issns":["1538-7836"],"journal":"Journal of Thrombosis & Haemostasis","last_mentioned_on":1447799163,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25418277?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25418277","pubdate":"2014-11-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"A novel conditional platelet depletion mouse model reveals the importance of platelets in protection against S. aureus bacteremia.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-conditional-platelet-depletion-mouse-model-reveals-importance-platelets-protection-against-sta"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6577121,"mean":6.1012807651375,"rank":5611515,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6577121,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":202582,"mean":7.7937111575125,"rank":160453,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":202582,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":839,"mean":3.7883436754177,"rank":702,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":839,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":3.4939393939394,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
