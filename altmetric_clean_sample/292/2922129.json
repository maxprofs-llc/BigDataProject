A 67-year-old Thai woman was diagnosed with endometrium carcinoma stage IC and was treated with surgery and radiations. Ten years later, she presented with a gradually enlarging mass on the pubic area, in the shape of a pair of panties. Skin biopsy of lesions confirmed angiosarcoma. The diagnosis was radiation-associated angiosarcoma. She was treated with chemotherapy due to unresectable tumour. The chemotherapy was started with paclitaxel 70 mg\/m(2) every 2 weeks. After completing the fifth cycle of paclitaxel, the lesion was markedly decreased in size and the symptoms previously described were also completely resolved.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006df6","authors":["Kanokrungsee, S.","Vachiramon, V.","Sirithanabadeekul, P."],"doi":"10.1159\/000369992","first_seen_on":"2014-11-25T10:59:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1662-6567",""],"issue":"3","journal":"Case Reports in Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1416956942,"links":["http:\/\/www.karger.com\/Article\/FullText\/369992"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.karger.com\/Article\/Pdf\/369992","pmid":"25566052","pubdate":"2014-11-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Karger Publishers","title":"The \u2018Pantie' Tumour","type":"article","volume":"6"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":2668636,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1698206,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171514,"mean":8.0187878703074,"rank":86706,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":64053,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171514,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85,"mean":1.5764761904762,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":3.3961538461538,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"SA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DermClub\/status\/537198919349182465","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2922129],"posted_on":"2014-11-25T10:59:37+00:00","author":{"name":"\u0646\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0629","url":"http:\/\/www.DermClub.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/492036299377754112\/aDAE1iMI_normal.jpeg","description":"\u200f\u200f\u200f\u200f\u200f\u200f\u200f\u200f\u200f\u200f\u200f\u200f\u200f\u200f\u200f\u200f\u200f\u200f\u200f\u200f\u200f\u200f\u200f\u200f\u200f\u200f\u200f\u200f\u200f\u200f\u200f\u200f\u200f\u200f\u200f\u200f\u200f\u0646\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0637\u0644\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0647\u062a\u0645\u064a\u0646 \u0628\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0629, \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0639\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0636 \u0648\u062c\u0631\u0627\u062d\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0644\u062f","id_on_source":"DermClub","tweeter_id":"1548296413","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2446},"tweet_id":"537198919349182465"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AbdullAlHargan\/status\/537382482480730112","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2922129],"posted_on":"2014-11-25T23:09:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Abdullah AlHargan","url":"http:\/\/DermClub.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/532175313606701056\/t7ls8YWG_normal.jpeg","description":"Dermatology Resident","id_on_source":"AbdullAlHargan","tweeter_id":"2871641462","geo":{"lt":24.68773,"ln":46.72185,"country":"SA"},"followers":1898},"tweet_id":"537382482480730112"}]}}
