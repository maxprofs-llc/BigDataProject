Adult specimens, 34 female (123.1 \u00b1 43.9g) and 45 male (135.5 \u00b1 43.4g), from Paraguay River, Corumb\u00e1, Brazil, were used. The number of nematode-cysts was determined in 79 livers and 25 of them randomly selected for histopathological analysis and morphometric measures of nematode-cysts (mean diameter, thickness of collagen layer, and cyst-wall layer). The percentage of cysts with MMCs on the periphery and density in the liver parenchyma was estimated. The average number of macroscopic cysts was of 48.7 \u00b1 2.78. Granulomatous reaction was observed surrounding the cysts. Diameter, collagen layer and cyst-wall measurements were 293.0 \u00b1 75.18 (\u00b5m), 17.72 \u00b1 6.01 (\u00b5m) and 12.21 \u00b1 9.51 (\u00b5m), respectively. The number of nematode-cysts was correlated with hepatosomatic index, (r=0.26, P<0.05). Collagen layer was correlated with cyst diameter (r=0.62, P<0.01). Pericystic and parenchymatous MMCs were moderately (r=0.48) and highly (r=0.90) correlated with nematode-cysts number. Morphological characteristics of hepatic tissue and cysts-nematodes measures suggest that G. inaequilabiatus acts as a paratenic host to nematodes in the larval stage.","authors":["Gizela Melina Galindo","Robson Andrade Rodrigues","Sandriely Fernanda Marcondes","Priscilla Soares","Luiz Eduardo Roland Tavares","Carlos Eurico Fernandes"],"doi":"10.1590\/s1984-29612017044","first_seen_on":"2017-09-14T10:15:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1984-2961"],"journal":"Revista brasileira de parasitologia veterinaria = Brazilian journal of veterinary parasitology : Orgao Oficial do Colegio Brasileiro de Parasitologia Veterinaria","last_mentioned_on":1505385980,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28902262?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28902262","pubdate":"2017-08-24T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"Morphological and morphometric features of nematode-cysts in Gymnotus inaequilabiatus liver in the Brazilian Pantanal","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":1.25,"1m":1.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Nematode_papers\/statuses\/908271748394532864","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25242120],"posted_on":"2017-09-14T10:10:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Nematode_papers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","description":"Twitter bot searching the web for new journal articles on #nematodes","id_on_source":"Nematode_papers","tweeter_id":"2882533695","geo":{"lt":54.58333,"ln":-5.93333,"country":"GB"},"followers":116},"tweet_id":"908271748394532864"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/nematologists\/statuses\/908280748708425730","license":"gnip","rt":["Nematode_papers"],"citation_ids":[25242120],"posted_on":"2017-09-14T10:46:20+00:00","author":{"name":"IFNS","url":"http:\/\/www.ifns.org\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/609063261795926017\/hEQ1D_FF_normal.png","description":"The International Federation of Nematology Societies aims to foster communication among nematologists worldwide.","id_on_source":"nematologists","tweeter_id":"3319351007","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":235},"tweet_id":"908280748708425730"}]}}
