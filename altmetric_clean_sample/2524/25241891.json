For this, e-health technologies are promising tools. But the current evidence for the implementation of e-health in inflammatory bowel disease is weak. For this a critical evaluation of the existing evidence is presented. Furthermore some essential conditions need to be full-filled. We need a robust digital infrastructure that is workable for the patient and the healthcare provider. Important legal issues need to be solved to protect the patient. And the e-health technologies will have to proof their durability, feasibility and acceptance for the patient on the long term.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f61000712d","authors":["Peter Bossuyt","Lieven Pouillon","Guillaume Bonnaud","Silvio Danese","Laurent Peyrin-Biroulet"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.dld.2017.08.026","first_seen_on":"2017-09-14T10:13:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["15908658","1878-3562"],"journal":"Digestive and Liver Disease","last_mentioned_on":1505383621,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28899622?dopt=Abstract&utm_content=buffer3d3aa&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmid":"28899622","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"E-health in inflammatory bowel diseases: More challenges than opportunities?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ehealth-inflammatory-bowel-diseases-more-challenges-opportunities"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414430,"mean":7.0825007427048,"rank":7272063,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414430,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128214,"mean":11.786037656088,"rank":104106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128214,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":772,"mean":2.8200700389105,"rank":516,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":772,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":2.1209090909091,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Med2Meds\/statuses\/908270855838474240","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25241891],"posted_on":"2017-09-14T10:07:01+00:00","author":{"name":"Med2Meds","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3096611195\/abe76ac7fa41a8f791a5d501ac1be664_normal.jpeg","description":"Comunicar, compartir experiencia, consultar...
