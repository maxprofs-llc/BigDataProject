Strategies are behavioral adaptations that allow goal achievement despite these constraining conditions. When strategies do not exist, are ineffective or maladaptive, medication performance and health outcomes are at risk. While constraints to medication adherence are described in literature, strategies used by patients to manage medications are less well-described or understood.\nGuided by cognitive engineering concepts, the aim of this study was to describe and analyze the strategies used by older adults with heart failure to achieve their medication management goals.\nThis mixed methods study employed an empirical strategies analysis method to elicit medication management strategies used by older adults with heart failure. Observation and interview data collected from 61 older adults with heart failure and 31 caregivers were analyzed using qualitative content analysis to derive categories, patterns and themes within and across cases.\nData derived thematic sub-categories described planned and ad hoc methods of strategic adaptations. Stable strategies proactively adjusted the medication management process, environment, or the patients themselves. Patients applied situational strategies (planned or ad hoc) to irregular or unexpected situations. Medication non-adherence was a strategy employed when life goals conflicted with medication adherence. The health system was a source of constraints without providing commensurate strategies.\nPatients strived to control their medication system and achieve goals using adaptive strategies. Future patient self-mangement research can benefit from methods and theories used to study professional work, such as strategies analysis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002824","authors":["Mickelson, Robin S","Holden, Richard J"],"doi":"10.1177\/1474515117730704","first_seen_on":"2017-09-14T10:14:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1474-5151","1873-1953"],"journal":"European Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1505383762,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28901787?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28901787","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"SAGE Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing","cardiology"],"title":"Medication management strategies used by older adults with heart failure: A systems-based analysis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/medication-management-strategies-used-older-adults-heart-failure-systemsbased-analysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414430,"mean":7.0825007427048,"rank":7272063,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414430,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128214,"mean":11.786077277655,"rank":104106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128214,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":291,"mean":5.0021793103448,"rank":244,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":291,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":5.4166666666667,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Computer Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jmankin\/statuses\/908271448460013574","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25242049],"posted_on":"2017-09-14T10:09:22+00:00","author":{"name":"jmankin","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/488481521267789825\/73To-FPA_normal.png","id_on_source":"jmankin","tweeter_id":"14104509","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":122},"tweet_id":"908271448460013574"}]}}
