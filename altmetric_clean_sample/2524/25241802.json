Previous research has focused on long time trials (\u2265 40 km) using power at ventilatory threshold and respiratory threshold to estimate time trial performance. As intensity greatly differs during shorter time trails applying findings from longer time trials may not be appropriate. The use of heart rate measures to determine 20 km time trial performance has yet to be examined. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of heart rate measures at ventilatory threshold (VE\/VO2 Plotted and VT determined by software) and respiratory threshold (RER of 0.95, 1.00, and 1.05) to predict 20 km time trial performance. Eighteen cyclists completed a VO2max protocol and two 20 km time trials. Average heart rates from 20 km time trials were compared with heart rates from performance threshold measures (VT plotted, VT software, and an RER at 0.95, 1.00, and 1.05) using repeated measures ANOVA. Significance was set a priori at P \u2264 0.05. The only measure not found to be significantly different in relation to time trial performance was HR at an RER of 1.00 (166.61\u00b112.70 bpm vs. 165.89 \u00b1 9.56 bpm, p = .671). VT plotting and VT determined by software were found to underestimate time trial performance by 3% and 8% respectively. From these findings it is recommended to use heart rate at a RER of 1.00 in order to determine 20 km time trial intensity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6b83cf058f610009c1c","authors":["WILLARD W.
