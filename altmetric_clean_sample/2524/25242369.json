Here we systematically investigate the pan-tissue transcriptional and genetic landscape of hypertension spanning dozens of tissues in hundreds of individuals. We find that in several tissues previously identified hypertension-linked genes are dysregulated and the gene expression profile is predictive of hypertension. Importantly, many expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) SNPs associated with the population variance of the dysregulated genes are linked with blood pressure in an independent genome-wide association study, suggesting that the functional effect of hypertension-associated SNPs may be mediated through tissue-specific transcriptional dysregulation. Analyses of pan-tissue transcriptional dysregulation profile, as well as eQTL SNPs underlying the dysregulated genes, reveals substantial heterogeneity among the hypertension patients, revealing two broad groupings - a Diffused group where several tissues exhibit hypertension-associated molecular alterations, and a Localized group where such alterations are localized to very few tissues. These two patient subgroups differ in several clinical phenotypes including respiratory disease, cerebrovascular, diabetes and heart disease. These findings suggest that the Diffused and Localized subgroups may be driven by different molecular mechanisms and have different genetic underpinning.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002942","authors":["Mahashweta Basu","Mahfuza Sharmin","Avinash Das","Nishanth Ulhas Nair","Kun Wang","Joo Sang Lee","Yen-Pei Christy Chang","Eytan Ruppin","Sridhar Hannenhalli"],"doi":"10.1534\/genetics.117.300280","first_seen_on":"2017-09-14T10:18:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0016-6731","1943-2631"],"journal":"Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1505385065,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28899996?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28899996","pubdate":"2017-09-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Prediction and Subtyping of Hypertension from Pan-tissue Transcriptomic and Genetic Analyses","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0.75,"1m":0.75,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414430,"mean":7.0825007427048,"rank":6083722,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2029137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414430,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128214,"mean":11.786077277655,"rank":82325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":38334,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128214,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3525,"mean":8.0517956867196,"rank":3053,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":399,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3525,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":4.3168,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/robo_gwas\/statuses\/908273140945502208","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25242369],"posted_on":"2017-09-14T10:16:06+00:00","author":{"name":"robo_gwas","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/753395443682381825\/Y_6sSC4y_normal.jpg","description":"Mostly robotic feed on publications to do with genome-wide association studies","id_on_source":"robo_gwas","tweeter_id":"753389367146737664","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":28},"tweet_id":"908273140945502208"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/eQTL_papers\/statuses\/908276912136404992","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25242369],"posted_on":"2017-09-14T10:31:05+00:00","author":{"name":"eQTLpapers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","description":"TwitterBot for eQTL papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ PrePrints.
