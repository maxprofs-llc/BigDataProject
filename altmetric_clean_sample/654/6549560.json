The feedback reflected the current 2D postural positions within the 2D functional stability boundary that was scaled to 75%, 30% and 12% of its original size. The findings showed that the distance of both COP and COM to the respective stability boundary was greater during the feedback trials compared to a no feedback condition. However, the temporal safety margin of the COP, that is, the virtual time-to-contact (VTC), was higher without feedback. The coupling relation of COP-COM showed stable in-phase synchronization over all of the feedback conditions for frequencies below 1Hz. For higher frequencies (up to 5Hz), there was progressive reduction of COP-COM synchronization and local adaptation under the presence of augmented feedback. The findings show that the augmented feedback of COM and COP motion differentially and adaptively influences spatial and temporal properties of postural motion relative to the stability boundary while preserving the organization of the COM-COP coupling in postural control.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002928","authors":["Melissa C.
