Here, we report that lung fibroblasts when activated by lung cancer cells produce tryptophan metabolite kynurenine (Kyn) that inhibits dendritic cells' differentiation and induces cancer growth as well as migration. We identified TDO2 (tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase) as the main enzyme expressed in fibroblasts capable of tryptophan metabolism. Mechanistically, condition medium of CAF or exogenous kynurenine stimulated AKT, with no lysine 1 (WNK1) and cAMP response element-bindingprotein (CREB) phosphorylation in lung cancer cells. Inhibition of the AKT\/CREB pathway prevents cancer proliferation, while inhibition of the AKT\/ WNK1 reverted epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cancer migration induced by kynurenine. Moreover, we also demonstrate that lung cancer-derived galectin-1 contributes to the upregulation of TDO2 in CAF through an AKT-dependent pathway. Immunohistochemical analysis of lung cancer surgical specimens revealed increased TDO2 expression in the fibroblasts adjacent to the cancer. Furthermore, in vivo studies showed that administration of TDO2 inhibitor significantly improves DCs function and T cell response, and decreases tumor metastasis in mice. Taken together, our data identify the feedback loop, consisting of cancer-derived galectin-1 and CAF-producing kynurenine, that sustains lung cancer progression. These findings suggest that targeting this pathway may be a promising therapeutic strategy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Hsu, Ya-Ling","Hung, Jen-Yu","Chiang, Shin-Yi","Jian, Shu-Fang","Wu, Cheng-Ying","Lin, Yi-Shiuan","Tsai, Ying-Ming","Chou, Shah-Hwa","Tsai, Ming-Ju","Kuo, Po-Lin"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.8488","first_seen_on":"2016-04-07T19:30:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"issue":"19","journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1460057404,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27050278?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC5053673","pmid":"27050278","pubdate":"2014-11-09T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Lung cancer-derived galectin-1 contributes to cancer associated fibroblast-mediated cancer progression and immune suppression through TDO2\/kynurenine axis","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lung-cancerderived-galectin1-contributes-cancer-associated-fibroblastmediated-cancer-progression-imm"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7516464,"mean":6.5017388130518,"rank":6511220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7516464,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270838,"mean":11.237147428158,"rank":228897,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270838,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6758,"mean":2.9322024567116,"rank":4972,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6758,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258,"mean":2.6933618677043,"rank":217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
