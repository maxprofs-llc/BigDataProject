In the present study, a lentiviral vector carrying a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to downregulate the expression of the monocarboxylate transporter type 2 (MCT2) in neurons of the rat somatosensory cortex (called S1BF) by ~ 25%. After one hour of whisker stimulation, HRMAS 1H-NMR spectroscopy analysis of S1BF perchloric acid extracts showed that while an increase in lactate content is observed in both uninjected and shRNA-control injected extracts, such an effect was abrogated in shMCT2 injected rats. A 13C-incorporation analysis following [1-13C]glucose infusion during the stimulation confirmed that the elevated lactate observed during activation originates from newly synthesized [3-13C]lactate, with blood-derived [1-13C]glucose being the precursor. Moreover, the analysis of the 13C-labeling of glutamate in position C3 and C4 indicates that upon activation, there is an increase in TCA cycle velocity for control rats while a decrease is observed for MCT2 knockdown animals. Using in vivo localized 1H-NMR spectroscopy, an increase in lactate levels is observed in the S1BF area upon whisker stimulation for shRNA-control injected rats but not for MCT2 knockdown animals. Finally, while a robust BOLD fMRI response was evidenced in control rats, it was absent in MCT2 knockdown rats. These data not only demonstrate that glucose-derived lactate is locally produced following neuronal activation but also suggest that its use by neurons via MCT2 is probably essential to maintain synaptic activity within the barrel cortex.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Leslie Mazuel","Jordy Blanc","Cendrine Repond","V\u00e9ronique Bouchaud","G\u00e9rard Raffard","Nicole D\u00e9glon","Gilles Bonvento","Luc Pellerin","Anne-Karine Bouzier-Sore","Mazuel, Leslie","Blanc, Jordy","Repond, Cendrine","Bouchaud, V\u00e9ronique","Raffard, G\u00e9rard","D\u00e9glon, Nicole","Bonvento, Gilles","Pellerin, Luc","Bouzier-Sore, Anne-Karine"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0174990","first_seen_on":"2017-04-07T17:36:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"4","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1492689060,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0174990&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0174990","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28388627?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0174990&type=printable","pmid":"28388627","pubdate":"2017-04-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0174990","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"A neuronal MCT2 knockdown in the rat somatosensory cortex reduces both the NMR lactate signal and the BOLD response during whisker stimulation","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neuronal-mct2-knockdown-rat-somatosensory-cortex-reduces-both-nmr-lactate-signal-bold-response-durin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":4,"6m":4,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454838,"mean":7.1053688124245,"rank":1869318,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":6523670,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454838,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251664,"mean":13.103135550319,"rank":75647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":175297,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251664,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116452,"mean":10.672080943917,"rank":33264,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":82503,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116452,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4660,"mean":10.821901266366,"rank":1325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":3317,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4660,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
