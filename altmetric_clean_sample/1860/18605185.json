A focused library of 6,8-dioxa-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]-octane peptidomimetic scaffolds was synthesized and assayed towards BACE1 enzyme, resulting in the identification of a thiolactam-containing hit compound possessing IC50 in the low micromolar range, and confirming the bicyclic acetal portion as a potential transition state analogue in the interaction with catalytic aspartic acid residues.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f1","authors":["Riccardo Innocenti","Elena Lenci","Gloria Menchi","Alberto Pupi","Andrea Trabocchi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bmc.2017.03.030","first_seen_on":"2017-04-07T17:44:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["09680896"],"journal":"Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1491585268,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28359674"],"pmid":"28359674","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"title":"Design and synthesis of bicyclic acetals as Beta Secretase (BACE1) inhibitors","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/design-synthesis-bicyclic-acetals-beta-secretase-bace1-inhibitors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":7,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8002981,"mean":6.7515998143141,"rank":1122077,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6808455,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8002981,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235178,"mean":12.877424382486,"rank":49620,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":183002,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235178,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1301,"mean":2.4149415384615,"rank":83,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":1176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1301,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":2.1655737704918,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":2,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Design and synthesis of bicyclic acetals as Beta Secretase (BACE1) inhibitors.","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=30158767114&p=1pl&v=1&x=-tlJ4OfLlYr36ArocAETJg","license":"public","citation_ids":[18605185],"posted_on":"2017-04-07T17:14:28+00:00","summary":".
