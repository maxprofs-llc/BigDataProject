The aim of this study was to determine factors associated with pancreatic triglyceride content (PTGC), and to investigate the impact of bariatric surgery on ectopic fat pads, pancreatic fat (PTGC) and hepatic fat (HTGC).Subjects:45 subjects (13 lean, 13 obese non diabetics and 19 type 2 diabetes, matched for age and gender) underwent (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, CT visceral abdominal fat, metabolic and lipidomic analysis, including HOMA-IR, HOMA-B and plasma fatty acids composition. Twenty obese subjects were reassessed 6 months after bariatric surgery.Results:PTGC was significantly higher in type 2 diabetic (23.8\u00b13.2%), compared to obese (14.0\u00b13.3; P=0.03) and lean subjects (7.5\u00b10.9% P=0.0002). PTGC remained significantly associated with type 2 diabetes after adjusting for age and sex (\u03b2=0.47; P=0.004), or even after adjusting for waist circumference, triglycerides and HOMA-IR (\u03b2=0.32; P=0.04). Type 2 diabetes, C18:1n-9 (oleic acid), uric acid, triglycerides, and PAI-1 were the 5 more important parameters involved in PTGC prediction (explained 80% of PTGC variance). Bariatric surgery induced a huge reduction of both HTGC (-51.2\u00b17.9%) and PTGC (-43.8\u00b17.0%) reaching lean levels, while BMI remained greatly elevated. An improvement of insulinresistance (HOMA-IR), and no change in HOMA-B was observed after bariatric surgery. The PTGC or HTGC losses were not correlated, suggesting tissue specific mobilization of these ectopic fat stores.Conclusion:Pancreatic fat increased with type 2 Diabetes and drastically decreased after bariatric surgery. This suggests that decreased PTGC may contribute to improved beta cell function seen after bariatric surgery. Further long-term interventional studies are warranted to examine this hypothesis, and to determine the degree to which ectopic fat mobilization may mediate the improvement in endocrine and exocrine pancreatic functions.International Journal of Obesity accepted article preview online, 21 July 2014; doi:10.1038\/ijo.2014.126.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b83","authors":["Gaborit B","Abdesselam I","Kober F","Jacquier A","Ronsin O","Emungania O","Lesavre N","Alessi MC","Martin JC","Bernard M","Dutour A"],"doi":"10.1038\/ijo.2014.126","first_seen_on":"2014-07-26T20:20:46+00:00","issns":["0307-0565","1476-5497"],"issue":"","journal":"International Journal of Obesity","last_mentioned_on":1451387078,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/25042860\/","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ijo\/journal\/v39\/n3\/full\/ijo2014126a.html","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25042860?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25042860","pubdate":"2014-07-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["metabolism"],"title":"Ectopic fat storage in the pancreas using 1 H-MRS: importance of diabetic status and modulation with bariatric surgery induced weight loss.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ectopic-fat-storage-pancreas-using-1hmrs-importance-diabetic-status-modulation-bariatric-surgeryindu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6889784,"mean":6.1841211059894,"rank":2544290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4307010,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6889784,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173770,"mean":7.2676005501559,"rank":52432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":119937,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173770,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2010,"mean":15.576959681434,"rank":1356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":636,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2010,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":18.154041666667,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
