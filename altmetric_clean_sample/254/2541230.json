When combined with high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) and efficient algorithms for the analysis of quantitative MS data, SILAC has proven to be the strategy of choice for the in-depth characterization of functional states at the protein level. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is one of the most widely used model systems for studies of genetics and developmental biology. Despite this, a global proteomic approach in Drosophila is rarely considered. Here, we describe an adaptation of SILAC for functional investigation of fruit flies by proteomics: We illustrate how to perform efficient SILAC labeling of cells in culture and whole fly larvae. The combination of SILAC, a highly accurate global protein quantification method, and of the fruit fly, the prime genetics and developmental model, represents a unique opportunity for quantitative proteomic studies in vivo.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd3b","authors":["Alessandro Cuomo","Roberta Sanfilippo","Thomas Vaccari","Tiziana Bonaldi"],"doi":"10.1007\/978-1-4939-1142-4_21","first_seen_on":"2014-07-26T10:43:53+00:00","issns":["1940-6029"],"journal":"Methods in molecular biology","last_mentioned_on":1406371406,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25059620?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25059620","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Proteomics Meets Genetics: SILAC Labeling of Drosophila melanogaster Larvae and Cells for In Vivo Functional Studies.","type":"article","volume":"1188","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/proteomics-meets-genetics-silac-labeling-drosophila-melanogaster-larvae-cells-vivo-functional-studie"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4077375,"mean":5.0819127539709,"rank":3263114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":101309,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4077375,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101332,"mean":8.0012008565988,"rank":80805,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":359,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101332,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2778,"mean":1.4710025207058,"rank":1732,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2778,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":1.1196428571429,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
