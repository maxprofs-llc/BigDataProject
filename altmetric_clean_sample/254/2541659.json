In contrast, low doses of rapamycin (10 micrograms\/kg) increase mTORC1 activity and protein synthesis in skeletal muscle. Similar changes are found with synthetic ligand for FKBP12 (SLF, which does not inhibit mTORC1) and in mice with a skeletal muscle-specific FKBP12 deficiency. These interventions also increase Ca2+ influx to enhance refilling of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores, slow muscle fatigue, and increase running endurance without negatively impacting cardiac function. FKBP12 deficiency or longer treatments with low dose rapamycin or SLF increase the percentage of Type I fibers, further adding to fatigue resistance. We demonstrate that FKBP12 and its ligands impacts multiple aspects of muscle function.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Chang Seok Lee","Dimitra K.
