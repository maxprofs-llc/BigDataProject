The investigation covered 41 subject, 22 of them had been applying vegetarian diet and 19 were omnivorous. The study shows statistically significant lower values of white blood cells, % and amounts of neutrocytes and insignificant lower level of red blood cells, hemoglobine, hematocrit and platelet in vegetarian group. Significant lower plasma urea level was observed in that group. These changes indicate that high quality deficiency protein was due to vegetarian diet.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9133cf058f61000ccbd","authors":["Nazarewicz R"],"first_seen_on":"2014-07-28T17:57:43+00:00","issns":["0035-7715"],"issue":"1","journal":"Roczniki Pa\u0144stwowego Zak\u0142adu Higieny","last_mentioned_on":1504330767,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17711086","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17711086"],"pmid":"17711086","pubdate":"2007-08-24T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"[The effect of vegetarian diet on selected biochemical and blood morphology parameters].","type":"article","volume":"58","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-vegetarian-diet-selected-biochemical-blood-morphology-parameters"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":3,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8461697,"mean":7.1088157534769,"rank":2094654,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":6326655,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8461697,"percentile":74},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":181600,"mean":7.6559329291463,"rank":46319,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":134347,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":181600,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120,"mean":4.9993949579832,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":89,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":9.2575,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Chemistry":1,"Philosophy":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"video":[{"title":"Q\/A: Why Vegan Have A Lower White Blood Cell Count?","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=A93SbswJ3Vg","image":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/A93SbswJ3Vg\/hqdefault.jpg","license":"public","citation_ids":[1649543,2544361,2544362,400758,1422209],"posted_on":"2014-07-27T20:55:26+00:00","summary":"Q\/A: Why Vegan Have A Lower White Blood Cell Count?\n\nImmune Function of Comparing Vegan to Nonvegans\nhttp:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10479236\n\nCytotoxic \nhttp:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2771803\n\nPoland Study\nhttp:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1771108","embed":{"type":"youtube","youtube_id":"A93SbswJ3Vg"},"author":{"name":"ChrisGoneRaw","id_on_source":"UCEllqIE394Rzx3CGuUKeWzQ"}}],"googleplus":[{"title":"Those with White Blood Cell (WBC) count above 7.9 were 3.37 times more likely to die than those with...","url":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/104116547838422018959\/posts\/FgvPPgh83cU","license":"public","citation_ids":[24514512,24514515,24514516,5320301,24514517,24514518,2544362],"posted_on":"2017-08-29T06:56:02+00:00","summary":"Those with White Blood Cell (WBC) count above 7.9 were 3.37 times more likely to die than those with...
