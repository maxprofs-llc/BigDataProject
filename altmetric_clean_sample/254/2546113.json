In this hybrid, Ge nanoparticles are closely embedded in a highly conductive and flexible carbon matrix. Such a hybrid features a high surface area (128.0\u2005m(2) g(-1)) and a hierarchical micropore-mesopore structure. When used as an anode material in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the as-prepared hybrid [C\/Ge (60.37%)] exhibits an improved lithium storage performance with regard to its capacity and rate capability compared to its counterparts. More specifically, it can maintain a specific capacity as high as 906\u2005mAh\u2009g(-1) at a high current density of 0.6\u2005A\u2009g(-1) after 50\u2005cycles. The excellent lithium storage performance of the C\/Ge (60.37%) sample can be attributed to synergetic effects between the carbon matrix and Ge nanoparticles. The method we adopted is simple and effective, and can be extended to fabricate other nanomaterials.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e58","authors":["Xiao, Ying","Cao, Minhua"],"doi":"10.1002\/asia.201402549","endpage":"2865","first_seen_on":"2014-07-28T22:16:08+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1861-471X","1861-4728"],"issue":"10","journal":"Chemistry - An Asian Journal","last_mentioned_on":1411915031,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201402549\/abstract;jsessionid=A18647A57FB4DA7F8DE7264C13812486.f01t01","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/asia.201402549","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201402549\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201402549\/pdf","pmid":"25070205","pubdate":"2014-07-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"2859","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Freeze\u2010Drying\u2010Assisted Synthesis of Hierarchically Porous Carbon\/Germanium Hybrid for High\u2010Efficiency Lithium\u2010Ion Batteries","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/freezedryingassisted-synthesis-hierarchically-porous-carbongermanium-hybrid-highefficiency-lithiumio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6340693,"mean":5.9251518979332,"rank":2503788,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":3769905,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6340693,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":136808,"mean":8.2609772306974,"rank":53498,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":81283,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":136808,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1506,"mean":1.3747561461794,"rank":179,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":1289,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1506,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":0.97872340425532,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
