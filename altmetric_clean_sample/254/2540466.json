They show that apical and basal dendrites are functionally specialized and that mechanisms regulating their development have important consequences for neuron function. The molecular identity of layer II-III neurons of the cerebral cortex is determined by the overlapping expression of Cux1 and Cux2. We previously showed that both Cux1 and Cux2 are necessary and nonredundant for normal dendrite development of layer II-III neurons. Loss of function of either gene reduced dendrite arbors, while overexpression increased dendritic complexity and suggested additive functions. We herein characterize the function of Cux1 and Cux2 in the development of apical and basal dendrites. By in vivo loss and gain of function analysis, we show that while the expression level of either Cux1 or Cux2 influences both apical and basal dendrites, they have distinct effects. Changes in Cux1 result in a marked effect on the development of the basal compartment whereas modulation of Cux2 has a stronger influence on the apical compartment. These distinct effects of Cux genes might account for the functional diversification of layer II-III neurons into different subpopulations, possibly with distinct connectivity patterns and modes of neuron response. Our data suggest that by their differential effects on basal and apical dendrites, Cux1 and Cux2 can promote the integration of layer II-III neurons in the intracortical networks in highly specific ways. \u00a9 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
