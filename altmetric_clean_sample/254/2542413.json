Individuals concomitantly taking lobeglitazone and a CYP3A4 inhibitor may experience some adverse effects secondary to increased systemic exposure to lobeglitazone. To address such potential concern, we evaluated the effects of ketoconazole, a prototypic CYP3A4 inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and associated adverse effects of lobeglitazone.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000257d","doi":"10.1016\/j.clinthera.2014.05.064","first_seen_on":"2014-07-27T00:30:49+00:00","issns":["0149-2918"],"issue":"7","journal":"Clinical Therapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1421605953,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.clinicaltherapeutics.com%2Farticle%2FS0149-2918%252814%252900355-5%2Fabstract&code=clithe-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.clinicaltherapeutics.com\/article\/S0149291814003555\/pdf","pmid":"25047497","pubdate":"2014-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"1064","subjects":["drugtherapy"],"title":"Effect of Ketoconazole on Lobeglitazone Pharmacokinetics in Korean Volunteers","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-ketoconazole-lobeglitazone-pharmacokinetics-korean-volunteers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":3553767,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":836668,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125796,"mean":8.3135268969357,"rank":84468,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":24414,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125796,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1222,"mean":2.5294529074529,"rank":785,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":200,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1222,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":2.055,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/clinthe\/status\/493191455054127104","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2542413],"posted_on":"2014-07-27T00:29:40+00:00","author":{"name":"clinicaltherapeutics","url":"http:\/\/www.clinicaltherapeutics.com\/home","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/901963433616306176\/3626f_ib_normal.jpg","description":"Elsevier peer-reviewed rapid dissemination of reliable and evolving evidence derived from clinical pharmacology and other therapeutic approaches.","id_on_source":"clinthe","tweeter_id":"372351408","geo":{"lt":39.76,"ln":-98.5,"country":"US"},"followers":1068},"tweet_id":"493191455054127104"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/clinthe\/status\/556881845699481600","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2542413],"posted_on":"2015-01-18T18:32:33+00:00","author":{"name":"clinicaltherapeutics","url":"http:\/\/www.clinicaltherapeutics.com\/home","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/901963433616306176\/3626f_ib_normal.jpg","description":"Elsevier peer-reviewed rapid dissemination of reliable and evolving evidence derived from clinical pharmacology and other therapeutic approaches.","id_on_source":"clinthe","tweeter_id":"372351408","geo":{"lt":39.76,"ln":-98.5,"country":"US"},"followers":1068},"tweet_id":"556881845699481600"}]}}
