While simulation has been used successfully for teaching and improving technical skills, more recently, multidisciplinary simulation has been used for training team skills. We hypothesized that this type of training is feasible and improves team skills in the operating theatre.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002360","authors":["Tan, Shaw Boon","Pena, Guilherme","Altree, Meryl","Maddern, Guy J.","Shaw Boon Tan","Guilherme Pena","Meryl Altree","Guy J.
