But their rarity in the bloodstream makes microfluidic isolation complex and time-consuming. Additionally the low processing speeds can be a hindrance to obtaining higher yields of CTCs, limiting their potential use as biomarkers for early diagnosis. Here, a high throughput microfluidic technology, the OncoBean Chip, is reported. It employs radial flow that introduces a varying shear profile across the device, enabling efficient cell capture by affinity at high flow rates. The recovery from whole blood is validated with cancer cell lines H1650 and MCF7, achieving a mean efficiency >80% at a throughput of 10 mL h(-1) in contrast to a flow rate of 1 mL h(-1) standardly reported with other microfluidic devices. Cells are recovered with a viability rate of 93% at these high speeds, increasing the ability to use captured CTCs for downstream analysis. Broad clinical application is demonstrated using comparable flow rates from blood specimens obtained from breast, pancreatic, and lung cancer patients. Comparable CTC numbers are recovered in all the samples at the two flow rates, demonstrating the ability of the technology to perform at high throughputs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6383cf058f610008951","authors":["Murlidhar V","Zeinali M","Grabauskiene S","Ghannad-Rezaie M","Wicha MS","Simeone DM","Ramnath N","Reddy RM","Nagrath S","Murlidhar, Vasudha","Zeinali, Mina","Grabauskiene, Svetlana","Ghannad\u2010Rezaie, Mostafa","Wicha, Max S.","Simeone, Diane M.","Ramnath, Nithya","Reddy, Rishindra M.","Nagrath, Sunitha"],"doi":"10.1002\/smll.201400719","endpage":"4904","first_seen_on":"2014-07-29T17:20:59+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1613-6829","1613-6810"],"issue":"23","journal":"Small","last_mentioned_on":1406654377,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/smll.201400719\/abstract;jsessionid=D49C5747E036E757782B0B86E663D53C.f01t01"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/smll.201400719\/pdf","pmid":"25074448","pubdate":"2014-07-28T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"4895","subjects":["biomedicalengineering","nanotechnology"],"title":"A Radial Flow Microfluidic Device for Ultra\u2010High\u2010Throughput Affinity\u2010Based Isolation of Circulating Tumor Cells","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/radial-flow-microfluidic-device-ultrahighthroughput-affinitybased-isolation-circulating-tumor-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6561414,"mean":6.0795715041865,"rank":5597478,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6561414,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":151295,"mean":8.0012835538754,"rank":122438,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":151295,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1566,"mean":5.0165022364217,"rank":1268,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1566,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":135,"mean":2.6529701492537,"rank":119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":135,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
