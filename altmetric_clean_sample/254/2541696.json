Recently, we have reported that two heptapeptides (Lys-Trp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Gly-Asp, KP6) coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) through the \u03b5-amino group of N-terminus Lys in the absence\/presence of 6-amino-n-caproic acid (AC) linker to FITC-(FITC)KP6 and (FITC-AC)KP6-can be useful as fluorescent probes for the specific detection of ox-LDL. In this study, to develop the fluorescent peptides with high plasma stability for the specific detection of ox-LDL, we investigated the interaction of (FITC)KP6 and (FITC-AC)KP6 substituted with D-Lys at the N-terminus-(FITC)dKP6 and (FITC-AC)dKP6-with ox-LDL, and the in vitro stability of these peptides in mouse plasma. (FITC)dKP6 and (FITC-AC)dKP6 bound with high specificity to ox-LDL in a dose-dependent manner, and also to ox-LDL in the mouse plasma. Furthermore, (FITC)dKP6 was more stable than (FITC)KP6 in mouse plasma (102.1% versus 69.0% remained after 1\u00a0h). These findings strongly suggest that (FITC)dKP6 and (FITC-AC)dKP6 may be effective fluorescent probes with higher plasma stability than (FITC)KP6 and (FITC-AC)KP6 for the specific detection of ox-LDL.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024e1","authors":["Sato, Akira","Yamanaka, Hikaru","Oe, Keitaro","Yokoyama, Izumi","Yamazaki, Yoji","Ebina, Keiichi"],"doi":"10.1111\/cbdd.12399","endpage":"355","first_seen_on":"2014-07-26T15:19:55+00:00","issns":["1747-0285","1747-0277"],"issue":"3","journal":"Chemical Biology & Drug Design","last_mentioned_on":1406387949,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cbdd.12399\/abstract;jsessionid=09AA77ADE233A21328E3C747ED19679D.f04t03","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/cbdd.12399"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cbdd.12399\/pdf","pmid":"25066364","pubdate":"2014-08-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"348","subjects":["pharmacology","biochemistry"],"title":"Highly Stable, Fluorescence\u2010Labeled Heptapeptides Substituted with a D\u2010Amino Acid for the Specific Detection of Oxidized Low\u2010Density Lipoprotein in Plasma","type":"article","volume":"85","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highly-stable-fluorescencelabeled-heptapeptides-substituted-damino-acid-specific-detection-oxidized"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6359353,"mean":5.9827480202391,"rank":4469673,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1658677,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6359353,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":149165,"mean":7.9397429942884,"rank":92619,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":50046,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":149165,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":686,"mean":1.6599299270073,"rank":250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":686,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":0.60357142857143,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
