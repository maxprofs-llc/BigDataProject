No mutations in any of the genes encoding the COX-protein subunits have been identified in LD(COX-) patients. Using complementation assays based on the fusion of LD(COX-) cell lines with several rodent\/human rho0 hybrids, we demonstrated that the COX phenotype was rescued by the presence of a normal human chromosome 9. Linkage analysis restricted the disease locus to the subtelomeric region of chromosome 9q, within the 7-cM interval between markers D9S1847 and D9S1826. Candidate genes within this region include SURF-1, the yeast homologue (SHY-1) of which encodes a mitochondrial protein necessary for the maintenance of COX activity and respiration. Sequence analysis of SURF-1 revealed mutations in numerous DNA samples from LD(COX-) patients, indicating that this gene is responsible for the major complementation group in this important mitochondrial disorder.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021ff","doi":"10.1086\/302150","first_seen_on":"2014-07-29T18:49:40+00:00","issns":["0002-9297"],"issue":"6","journal":"American Journal of Human Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1406659679,"links":["http:\/\/www.cell.com\/ajhg\/abstract\/S0002-9297%2807%2961605-X"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S000292970761605X\/pdf","pmid":"9837813","pubdate":"1998-01-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1609","subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Mutations of SURF-1 in Leigh Disease Associated with Cytochrome c Oxidase Deficiency","type":"article","volume":"63","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mutations-surf1-leigh-disease-associated-cytochrome-c-oxidase-deficiency"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4090466,"mean":5.0881265763848,"rank":3274478,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":101381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4090466,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101849,"mean":7.9655462061112,"rank":81198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":347,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101849,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3085,"mean":6.6174409857328,"rank":2640,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":314,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3085,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":4.1875,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Ph.
