Challenges in assessing actual condom use behavior among early adolescents render the precursor measure, intention to use condoms, an appealing alternative. While analyzing data from a randomized controlled trial to evaluate a theory-based intervention program to promote condom use among early adolescents, we observed a modest effect with regard to condom use intention when the linear analytical approach was used. If intention, as a measure of the readiness to perform a behavior, also contains a nonlinear discrete component, it would be more appropriately modeled using a nonlinear approach. In this study, data from a randomized controlled trial (N=1360) were analyzed using the cusp catastrophe method with HIV knowledge and condom skills as the asymmetry variables and condom use self-efficacy as the bifurcation variables. Findings from concurrent and longitudinal modeling analyses indicated a much better fit of the cusp model (R2 = 0.85); AIC and BIC were one-fourth that of than the linear (R2 lt; 0.10) or the logistic model (R2 lt; 0.15). Receipt of the intervention as an asymmetry variable was significantly predicted condom use intention but did not as a bifurcation variable. In conclusion, adolescent intentions to use a condom contain both a continuous process and a discrete process and can better be modeled with cusp catastrophe methods. A much greater program effect is likely from the same prevention intervention if additional measures are taken to foster sudden changes in condom intention.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f6100082ee","authors":["Xinguang Chen","Bonita Stanton","Ding-Geng Chen","Xiaoming Li"],"first_seen_on":"2014-07-26T03:06:54+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"3","journal":"Nonlinear Dynamics Psychology and Life Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1408201818,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4106698\/?report=classic"],"pmid":"23735493","pubdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"NIH Public Access","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Mathematics","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"385","title":"INTENTION TO USE CONDOM, CUSP MODELING, AND EVALUATION OF AN HIV PREVENTION INTERVNETION TRIAL","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intention-condom-cusp-modeling-evaluation-hiv-prevention-intervention-trial-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":2296842,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1616294,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109437,"mean":7.9970131949269,"rank":53699,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":40704,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109437,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":2.994,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Social Sciences":2,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/LGBTjournal\/status\/492868476131094528","license":"datasift","rt":["HIV_Insight"],"citation_ids":[2540593],"posted_on":"2014-07-26T03:06:16+00:00","author":{"name":"LGBT Journal","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/433542126891048960\/3_q6T9pX_normal.png","description":"The world's most comprehensive #LGBT news feed. #lgbtq #lgbtqi #lesbian #gay #bisexual #transexual #queer #intersex #love #equality #noh8 #hiv #aids","id_on_source":"LGBTjournal","tweeter_id":"1640393216","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1440},"tweet_id":"492868476131094528"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/LGBTjournal\/status\/500659373409304576","license":"datasift","rt":["HIV_Insight"],"citation_ids":[2540593],"posted_on":"2014-08-16T15:04:31+00:00","author":{"name":"LGBT Journal","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/433542126891048960\/3_q6T9pX_normal.png","description":"The world's most comprehensive #LGBT news feed. #lgbtq #lgbtqi #lesbian #gay #bisexual #transexual #queer #intersex #love #equality #noh8 #hiv #aids","id_on_source":"LGBTjournal","tweeter_id":"1640393216","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1440},"tweet_id":"500659373409304576"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/David_de_Croy\/status\/500660831005462528","license":"datasift","rt":["HIV_Insight"],"citation_ids":[2540593],"posted_on":"2014-08-16T15:10:18+00:00","author":{"name":"David","url":"http:\/\/samishivanddoingfine.blogspot.co.uk\/","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/514812353548804096\/CXHy3L-k_normal.png","description":"I'm HIV positive; I'm gay - the two are not synonymous.
