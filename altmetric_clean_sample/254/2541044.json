Cohen syndrome (CS) is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with multiple clinical manifestations including developmental delay, acquired microcephaly, myopia, pigmentary retinopathy, joint hypermobility, truncal obesity, friendly disposition and intermittent neutropenia. In young patients, diagnosis is difficult, since several of the characteristic features may not be present until school age or later years and the intermittent neutropenia is not always detectable.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000254b","authors":["Ivan Prokudin","Dong Li","Sijie He","Yiran Guo","Linda Goodwin","Meredith Wilson","Loreto Rose","Lifeng Tian","Yulan Chen","Jinlong Liang","Brendan Keating","Xun Xu","Robyn V Jamieson","Hakon Hakonarson","Prokudin I","Li D","He S","Guo Y","Goodwin L","Wilson M","Rose L","Tian L","Chen Y","Liang J","Keating B","Xu X","Jamieson RV","Hakonarson H"],"doi":"10.1111\/ceo.12391","endpage":"138","first_seen_on":"2014-07-26T10:07:43+00:00","issns":["1442-9071","1442-6404"],"issue":"2","journal":"Clinical & Experimental Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1407872731,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25060287?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25060287"],"pmid":"25060287","pubdate":"2014-07-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"132","subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Value of whole exome sequencing for syndromic retinal dystrophy diagnosis in young patients.","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/value-whole-exome-sequencing-syndromic-retinal-dystrophy-diagnosis-young-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":2124433,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2236421,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109436,"mean":7.9972975373511,"rank":47565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":56771,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109436,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":369,"mean":1.6238097826087,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":369,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.87222222222222,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
