Despite the evidence-based utilization of FDG PET\/CT in aggressive lymphomas, the utility of PET in FL remains controversial and varies across different jurisdictions. The management of patients with FL differs from aggressive lymphomas and is usually reserved for patients with localized disease in whom long term control may potentially be achieved by involved field radiotherapy (IFRT), or for symptomatic patients with advanced stage disease in whom systemic therapy is indicated. There is a growing body of literature supporting the use of PET\/CT in initial staging of FL to guide management decisions. In this review we will summarize the existing literature and present cases from our experience to illustrate current knowledge on the potential role of FDG PET\/CT in FL.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002453","authors":["Ur Metser","Douglas Hussey","Grainne Murphy"],"doi":"10.1259\/bjr.20140360","first_seen_on":"2014-07-26T11:03:48+00:00","issns":["1748-880X"],"journal":"British Journal of Radiology","last_mentioned_on":1418891847,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25061910?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25061910?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25061910","pubdate":"2014-07-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The British Institute of Radiology.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["radiology"],"title":"Impact of (18)F-FDG PET\/CT on the staging and management of follicular lymphoma.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-18ffdg-petct-staging-management-follicular-lymphoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4637332,"mean":5.4218076474657,"rank":3002123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1462874,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4637332,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110699,"mean":8.2841887658314,"rank":69048,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":37282,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110699,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":501,"mean":2.047592,"rank":304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":185,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":501,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.225,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Other":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"US":1,"BR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/statasiore\/status\/492988177582653440","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2541264],"posted_on":"2014-07-26T11:01:55+00:00","author":{"name":"Stephen Tatasciore","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/868366724428693505\/Les1CNnn_normal.jpg","description":"2017 Edition - I'm a very lucky Father of three fantastic kids, enjoying life one day at a time!
