Viral infection has emerged as the most common cause of severe episodes of asthma. For the treatment of bronchial asthma, the root of liquorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) has been used as a traditional medicine in the East and West. Licochalcone A is the predominant, characteristic chalcone in liquorice root. To determine whether licochalcone A possesses an anti-inflammatory effect, we tested its effect on the expression and production of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in BEAS 2B cells and primary bronchial epithelial cells. We found that polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly-IC)-induced TSLP expression was suppressed by treatment with licochalcone A in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We also found that poly-IC-induced mRNA expression of other proinflammatory mediators such as MCP-1, RANTES, and IL-8 was suppressed by licochalcone A. Furthermore, licochalcone A suppressed poly-IC-induced nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) nuclear translocation and DNA-binding activity by suppressing the I\u03ba\u03b2 kinase (IKK) activity but not by direct phosphorylation of p65 at serine 276. Collectively, our findings suggest that licochalcone A suppresses poly-IC-induced TSLP expression and production by inhibiting the IKK\/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, which might be involved in the pathogenesis of virus-exacerbated asthma. Further elucidation of the mechanisms underlying these observations can help develop therapeutic strategies for virally induced asthma.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073b7","authors":["Sung-Ho Kim","Min Yang","Jian-Gang Xu","Xi Yu","Xue-Jiao Qian"],"doi":"10.1177\/1535370214545020","first_seen_on":"2014-07-25T22:17:27+00:00","issns":["1535-3699"],"journal":"Experimental Biology and Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1427191625,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25055998","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25055998?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25055998","pubdate":"2014-07-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","biology","physiology"],"title":"Role of licochalcone A on thymic stromal lymphopoietin expression: Implications for asthma.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-licochalcone-thymic-stromal-lymphopoietin-expression-implications-asthma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4912897,"mean":5.8425670606536,"rank":3476738,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":803404,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4912897,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123128,"mean":8.251657573075,"rank":82776,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":23952,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123128,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":551,"mean":3.4519018181818,"rank":378,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":120,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":551,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.39,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
