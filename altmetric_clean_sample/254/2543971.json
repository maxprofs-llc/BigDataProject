Accumulating evidence now implicates that acetaldehyde, the first metabolite of EtOH, may play an important role in mediating some of the rewarding properties of its parent compound. The objective of this study was to investigate if the increase in accumbal dopamine output observed when administering EtOH locally in the nAc by reversed microdialysis is mediated by acetaldehyde.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021c6","authors":["Rhona B.C.
