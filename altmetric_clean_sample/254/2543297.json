Diagnosis and treatment of SIFs are challenging. Currently, surgical treatment includes sacroplasty under C-arm fluoroscopy or computed tomography. Both techniques have a risk of accuracy and high radiation exposure. A sacral insufficiency fracture patient treated using robotic assisted surgery is presented and present literature is discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9243cf058f61000db5d","authors":["Onen MR","Simsek M","Naderi S"],"doi":"10.5137\/1019-5149.jtn.8596-13.0","first_seen_on":"2014-07-27T16:14:57+00:00","issns":["1019-5149"],"issue":"4","journal":"Turkish neurosurgery","last_mentioned_on":1406477649,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25050685?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25050685","pubdate":"2014-07-24T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurosurgery"],"title":"Robotic assisted sacroplasty: a case report.","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/robotic-assisted-sacroplasty-case-report"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":3055251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":938299,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109469,"mean":7.9901566485185,"rank":72608,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":26134,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109469,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":157,"mean":0.82724358974359,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":157,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":2.125,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
