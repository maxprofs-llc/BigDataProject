With the analysis of three nucleobases including 6-methyluracil (6MU), uracil (U) and thymine (T) as examples, different orders of clusters centered with different metal ions were recorded in both positive and negative modes. Compared with the results obtained by traditional electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) under the same condition, more clusters with high orders, such as [6MU7+Na](+), [6MU15+2NH4](2+), [6MU10+Na](+), [T7+Na](+), and [T15+2NH4](2+) were detected by V-EASI-MS, which demonstrated the soft ionization ability of V-EASI for studying the non-covalent interaction in a self-assembly process. Furthermore, with the injection of K(+) to the system by a syringe pumping, the real-time monitoring of the formation of nucleobases clusters was achieved by the direct extraction of samples from the system under the Venturi effect. Therefore, the effect of cations on the formation of clusters during self-assembly of nucleobases was demonstrated, which was in accordance with the reports. Free of high voltage, heating or radiation during the ionization, this technique is much soft and suitable for obtaining the real-time information of the self-assembly system, which also makes it quite convenient for extraction samples from the reaction system. This \"easy and soft\" ionization technique has provided a potential pathway for monitoring and controlling the self-assembly processes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003609","authors":["Na Na","Ruixia Shi","Zi Long","Xin Lu","Fubin Jiang","Jin Ouyang"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.talanta.2014.04.080","first_seen_on":"2014-07-26T10:03:15+00:00","issns":["1873-3573"],"journal":"Talanta","last_mentioned_on":1432722098,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25059173?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25059173","pubdate":"2014-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Real-time analysis of self-assembled nucleobases by Venturi easy ambient sonic-spray ionization mass spectrometry.","type":"article","volume":"128","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/realtime-analysis-selfassembled-nucleobases-venturi-easy-ambient-sonicspray-ionization-mass-spectrom"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5153898,"mean":6.0935305781261,"rank":4285328,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5153898,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128931,"mean":8.2957196308075,"rank":103502,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128931,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1128,"mean":1.2034427684117,"rank":918,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1128,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":2.6975294117647,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
