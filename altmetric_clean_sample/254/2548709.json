The monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides are semiconducting and are unique due to the coupling between the spin and valley degrees of freedom originating from the relativistic spin-orbit interaction. Here, we report the direct observation of valley-dependent out-of-plane spin polarization in an archetypal transition-metal dichalcogenide--MoS2--using spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The result is in fair agreement with a first-principles theoretical prediction. This was made possible by choosing a 3R polytype crystal, which has a non-centrosymmetric structure, rather than the conventional centrosymmetric 2H form. We also confirm robust valley polarization in the 3R form by means of circularly polarized photoluminescence spectroscopy. Non-centrosymmetric transition-metal dichalcogenide crystals may provide a firm basis for the development of magnetic and electric manipulation of spin\/valley degrees of freedom.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000426d","authors":["R.
