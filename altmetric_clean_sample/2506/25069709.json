Ideally, charge carriers should be able to move freely in a homogeneous environment. Here, we report on evidence suggesting that excess carriers in electrochemically p-doped semiconducting single-wall carbon nanotubes (s-SWNTs) become localized, most likely due to poorly screened Coulomb interactions with counterions in the Helmholtz layer. A quantitative analysis of blue-shift, broadening and asymmetry of the first exciton absorption band also reveals that doping leads to hard segmentation of s-SWNTs with intrinsic undoped segments being separated by randomly distributed charge puddles approximately 4\\,nm in width. Light absorption in these doped segments is associated with the formation of trions, spatially separated from neutral excitons. Acceleration of exciton decay in doped samples is governed by diffusive exciton transport and non-radiative decay at charge puddles within 3.2\\,ps in moderately doped s-SWNTs. The results suggest that conventional band-filling in s-SWNTs breaks down due to inhomogeneous electrochemical doping.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006816","authors":["Klaus H.
