All the variables were assessed through a booklet of 10 validated questionnaires. Multiple regression analysis and moderation analysis were performed.\nPredictors included in multiple regression models explain 3%-42% (adjusted R(2)) of the variance in psychological risk factors. Moreover, analyses reveal a significant moderator effect of somatosensory amplification on the link between fear-avoidance beliefs linked to work and pain intensity (F(3;250)=12.33; p=.00), of somatosensory amplification and brooding on the link between depression and functional repercussions (FR) on everyday life (F(3;252)=13.36; p=.000; F(1;252)=12.42; p=.00), of the reflection dimension of rumination on the link between the helplessness dimension of catastrophizing and FRs on sociability (F(3;252)=37.02; p=.00). There is also a moderation analysis with a significant trend concerning the lack of emotional awareness and the difficulties in controlling impulsive behaviours.\nOur results indicate an important role of some dimensions of difficulties in emotional regulation, somatosensory amplification and rumination in the increase in negative affects and dysfunctional beliefs, and in the links between those psychological risk factors and pain\/disability.\nThis study identifies some cognitive and emotional dysregulations substantially involved in work-related chronic pain. This contribute to put in place psychotherapeutic protocols to tackle these deficits and dysregulations in a relevant way.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f610008896","authors":["M. Le Borgne","A.H.
