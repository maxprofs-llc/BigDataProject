As primary and secondary genotoxicity may play a role in MWCNT carcinogenesis, we used a battery of assays for DNA damage and micronuclei to compare the genotoxicity of straight (MWCNT-S) and tangled MWCNTs (MWCNT-T) in vitro (primary genotoxicity) and in vivo (primary or secondary genotoxicity). C57Bl\/6 mice showed a dose-dependent increase in DNA strand breaks, as measured by the comet assay, in lung cells 24\u2009h after a single pharyngeal aspiration of MWCNT-S (1-200\u2009\u03bcg\/mouse). An increase was also observed for DNA strand breaks in lung and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells and for micronucleated alveolar type II cells in mice exposed to aerosolized MWCNT-S (8.2-10.8\u2009mg\/m(3)) for 4 d, 4\u2009h\/d. No systemic genotoxic effects, assessed by the \u03b3-H2AX assay in blood mononuclear leukocytes or by micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPCEs) in bone marrow or blood, were observed for MWCNT-S by either exposure technique. MWCNT-T showed a dose-related decrease in DNA damage in BAL and lung cells of mice after a single pharyngeal aspiration (1-200\u2009\u03bcg\/mouse) and in MNPCEs after inhalation exposure (17.5\u2009mg\/m(3)). In vitro in human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells, MWCNT-S induced DNA strand breaks at low doses (5 and 10\u2009\u03bcg\/cm(2)), while MWCNT-T increased strand breakage only at 200\u2009\u03bcg\/cm(2). Neither of the MWCNTs was able to induce micronuclei in vitro. Our findings suggest that both primary and secondary mechanisms may be involved in the genotoxicity of straight MWCNTs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f610004257","authors":["Julia Catal\u00e1n","Kirsi M.
