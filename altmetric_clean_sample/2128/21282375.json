Using a mutant cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV) genome incapable of expressing the viral E4 protein, we have shown that E4 is required for the productive stage of the CRPV life cycle in New Zealand White and cottontail rabbits. In these lesions, E4 was not required for papilloma development, but the onset of viral DNA amplification and L1 expression were abolished. Viral genome amplification was partially restored when mutant genomes able to express longer forms of E4 were used. These findings suggest that efficient amplification of the CRPV genome is dependent on the expression of a full-length CRPV E4 protein.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f92","authors":["Peh WL","Brandsma JL","Christensen ND","Cladel NM","Wu X","Doorbar J"],"doi":"10.1128\/jvi.78.4.2142-2151.2004","first_seen_on":"2017-06-23T03:03:15+00:00","issns":["0022-538X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Virology","last_mentioned_on":1498186991,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14747580"],"pmcid":"PMC369506","pmid":"14747580","pubdate":"2004-02-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"The viral E4 protein is required for the completion of the cottontail rabbit papillomavirus productive cycle in vivo.","type":"article","volume":"78","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/viral-e4-protein-required-completion-cottontail-rabbit-papillomavirus-productive-cycle-vivo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":2160973,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5104557,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237414,"mean":12.921400142368,"rank":79587,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":155485,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237414,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6948,"mean":4.3444655246869,"rank":1548,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3912,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6948,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":183,"mean":5.2442527472527,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":183,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
