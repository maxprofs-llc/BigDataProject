The waveform of action potentials recorded concurrently with swimming events shows evidence of electrotonic coupling between these neurons, which are also directly photosensitive and receive excitatory synaptic input from other conduction systems.","ads_id":"1977Sci...197..186A","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["PA Anderson","GO Mackie"],"doi":"10.1126\/science.17918","first_seen_on":"2015-08-20T11:29:27+00:00","issns":["0036-8075","1095-9203"],"issue":"4299","journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":1440070924,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/content\/197\/4299\/186.short"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/content\/197\/4299\/186.full.pdf","pmid":"17918","pubdate":"1977-07-08T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Electrically coupled, photosensitive neurons control swimming in a jellyfish","type":"article","volume":"197","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/work-tuberculous"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5565912,"mean":6.3304610756451,"rank":2683241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2829200,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5565912,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192345,"mean":9.1926344778106,"rank":92758,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":97590,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192345,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33730,"mean":29.244524889561,"rank":27042,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":6628,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33730,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":730,"mean":66.173991769547,"rank":632,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":98,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":730,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/tiempoasm\/statuses\/634326303961911296","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4416651],"posted_on":"2015-08-20T11:29:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Alejandro Salgado M","url":"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/tiempoasm\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/830411241407471616\/n9GDoOIE_normal.jpg","description":"Cofounder @neurosketch, member of @xmodal.
