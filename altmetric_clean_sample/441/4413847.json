The gene is about 6 kb in length and consists of nine exons. The 5'-flanking region of the gene lacks typical TATAA sequence but has a single defined transcription initiation site detected by the primer extension method. Two putative glucocorticoid-responsive elements and a putative thyroid hormone-responsive element are present. The AMT gene was assigned to subband 3p21.2-p21.1 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002945","authors":["Nanao, K","Takada, G","Takahashi, E","Seki, N","Komatsu, Y","Okamura-Ikeda, K","Motokawa, Y","Hayasaka, K"],"first_seen_on":"2015-08-19T18:54:02+00:00","issns":["0888-7543"],"issue":"1","journal":"Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1437418138,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8188235"],"pmid":"8188235","pubdate":"1994-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information Systems","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Structure and chromosomal localization of the aminomethyltransferase gene (AMT)","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structure-chromosomal-localization-aminomethyltransferase-gene-amt"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5376712,"mean":6.2846964625775,"rank":1354792,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3403405,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5376712,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187926,"mean":9.2275408381004,"rank":58379,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":127385,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187926,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3262,"mean":2.965750383318,"rank":134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":318,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3262,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":1.65,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Aminomethyltransferase","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=672310674#altmetric_citation_01f2d939-8e58-4218-a513-0d50c392673f","license":"public","citation_ids":[4413847],"posted_on":"2015-07-20T18:48:58+00:00","summary":"The protein encoded by this gene has its crystal structure resolved at 2 Angstroms.
