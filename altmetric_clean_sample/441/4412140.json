Complete autotrophic simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) without organics addition was achieved in nitrifying-MFC (N-MFC) with TN removal rate of 0.35 mg\/(L\u2022h), which was even higher than denitrifying-MFC (D-MFC) at same total nitrogen (TN) level. Integrated denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis based on both 16S rRNA and nirK genes showed Alpha-, Gamma- proteobacteria were the main denitrifier communities. Some potential autotrophic denitrifying bacteria which can use electrons and reducing power from cathodes, such as Shewanella oneidensis, Shewanella loihica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Starkeya novella and Rhodopseudomonas palustris were identified and selectively enriched on cathode biofilm. Further, relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria characterized by nirK\/16S ratios were much higher in biofilm than suspended sludge according to real time PCR. The highest enrichment efficiency for denitrifiers was obtained in N-MFC cathode biofilm which confirmed autotrophic denitrifying bacteria enrichment is the key factor for MFC denitrification system.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d63cf058f61000114d","authors":["Li, Chao","Xu, Ming","Lu, Yi","Fang, Fang","Cao, Jiashun"],"doi":"10.1080\/09593330.2015.1080764","first_seen_on":"2015-08-19T11:06:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0959-3330"],"journal":"Environmental Technology","last_mentioned_on":1440016592,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26278100?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26278100","pubdate":"2015-08-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Comparative analysis of microbial community between different cathode systems of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) for denitrification.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparative-analysis-microbial-community-between-different-cathode-systems-microbial-fuel-cells-deni"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5561783,"mean":6.3274340957638,"rank":2734501,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2661178,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5561783,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192234,"mean":9.1835976965454,"rank":94677,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":89162,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192234,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254,"mean":1.3028221343874,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":183,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":0.89666666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
