In an attempt to generate immunogens that target the glycan shield of HIV-1, we previously engineered a triple mutant (TM) strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that results in exclusive presentation of high mannose type N-glycans, and identified five TM yeast glycoproteins that support strong binding of 2G12, a bNAb that targets a cluster of high mannose glycans on the gp120 subunit of Env. Here, we further analyzed the antigenicity and immunogenicity of these proteins in inducing anti-HIV responses. Our study demonstrated that the 2G12-reactive TM yeast glycoproteins efficiently bound to recently identified bNAbs including PGT125-130 and PGT135 that recognize high mannose glycan-dependent epitopes. Immunization of rabbits with a single TM yeast glycoprotein (Gp38 or Pst1), when conjugated to a promiscuous T-cell epitope peptide and coadministered with a Toll-like receptor 2 agonist, induced glycan-specific HIV-1 Env cross-reactive antibodies. The immune sera bound to both synthetic mannose oligosaccharides and gp120 proteins from a broad range of HIV-1 strains. The purified antibodies recognized and captured virions that contain both complex- and high mannose-type of N-glycans, and potently neutralized virions from different HIV-1 clades but only when the virions were enforced to retain high mannose N-glycans. This study provides insights into the elicitation of anti-carbohydrate, HIV-1 Env-cross reactive antibodies with a heterologous glycoprotein and may have applications in the design and administration of immunogens that target the viral glycan shield for development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036ea","authors":["Zhang, Hong","Fu, Hu","Luallen, Robert J","Liu, Bingfen","Lee, Fang-Hua","Doms, Robert W","Geng, Yu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.vaccine.2015.08.012","first_seen_on":"2015-08-19T20:28:49+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid"],"issns":["1873-2518","0264410X"],"journal":"Vaccine","last_mentioned_on":1440700231,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26277072?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0264410X15011263"],"pmid":"26277072","pubdate":"2015-08-19T22:03:08+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Veterinary","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Antibodies elicited by yeast glycoproteins recognize HIV-1 virions and potently neutralize virions with high mannose N-glycans ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antibodies-elicited-yeast-glycoproteins-recognize-hiv1-virions-potently-neutralize-virions-high-mann"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5557318,"mean":6.3845700736537,"rank":3918680,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":929859,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5557318,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192699,"mean":9.1826281538989,"rank":132904,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":38301,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192699,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3670,"mean":6.7331883346961,"rank":2644,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":504,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3670,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125,"mean":6.6493064516129,"rank":89,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
