The activity of the opportunistic pathogens associated with plant root, their adaptation and survival under hostile environmental condition is poorly understood. In this study the salt tolerance ability of Methylobacterium mesophilicum and its colonization in the root and shoot of plants under severe drought and salt stress conditions were investigated. The colonization of plant by M. mesophilicum was investigated in a gnotobiotic sand system, and their survival in pots with saline soil. Bacterial strain was found to colonize rhizosphere of cucumber, tomato and paprika grown under normal and salt stress condition and reached up to 6.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(4) and 2.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(4)\u00a0CFU\/g root. The strain was resistant to Gentamicin, Ampicillin, Amoxicillin plus Clavulanic acid, Cefotaxime, neomycin, penicillin and was also tolerant to salinity stress (up to 6% NaCl). These abilities play important roles in enabling persistent colonization of the plant surface by M. mesophilicum strains. In conclusion, this study provides background information on the behaviour of opportunistic pathogen M. mesophilicum on plants and their survival in harsh environmental conditions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f61000888f","authors":["Egamberdieva, Dilfuza","Wirth, Stephan","Alqarawi, Abdulaziz A","Abd Allah, E F"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.sjbs.2015.06.029","first_seen_on":"2015-08-20T10:02:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1319-562X"],"issue":"5","journal":"Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1440067383,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26288563?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26288563?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26288563","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Salt tolerant Methylobacterium mesophilicum showed viable colonization abilities in the plant rhizosphere.","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/salt-tolerant-methylobacterium-mesophilicum-showed-viable-colonization-abilities-plant-rhizosphere"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5565912,"mean":6.3304610756451,"rank":2902957,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2637740,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5565912,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192344,"mean":9.1926937086351,"rank":103161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":88015,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192344,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126,"mean":2.063424,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":77,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":2.0587142857143,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
