The incidence, risk factors, and clinical course of chyle fistula were investigated, as well as the outcomes of conventional management and the use of octreotide injection in high-output chyle fistula.\nThe overall incidence of chyle fistula was 4.7\u00a0% (22\/472), with an incidence of 3.0\u00a0% and 6.2\u00a0% after right and left neck dissection, respectively. The presence of a metastatic lesion around the junction of the internal jugular vein and subclavian vein was the only factor significantly associated with the development of chyle fistula (approximately fourfold higher risk) in univariate and multivariate analyses. In 22 cases of chyle fistula, the mean total drainage volume was 3226\u00a0mL during a mean 15.4\u00a0days of drain placement. Total parental nutrition for the management of chyle fistula was required in 16 cases. Nine (40.9\u00a0%) of 22 cases experienced additional complications related to chyle fistula. Of the six high-output cases, four were managed with conservative methods plus octreotide injection, and three did not require surgery.\nThe incidence of chyle fistula after neck dissection was higher than expected, especially on the right side. Surgeons should pay greater attention to chyle fistula from preoperative evaluation to postoperative management.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a31","authors":["Ahn, Dongbin","Sohn, Jin Ho","Jeong, Ji Yun"],"doi":"10.1245\/s10434-015-4822-7","first_seen_on":"2015-08-20T15:38:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1534-4681"],"journal":"Annals of Surgical Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1440085083,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26286200?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26286200","pubdate":"2015-08-20T22:01:22+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms","generalsurgery"],"title":"Chyle Fistula After Neck Dissection: An 8-Year, Single-Center, Prospective Study of Incidence, Clinical Features, and Treatment.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chyle-fistula-after-neck-dissection-8year-singlecenter-prospective-study-incidence-clinical-features"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5565812,"mean":6.3306026370649,"rank":2928155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1871608,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5565812,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192343,"mean":9.1927771157626,"rank":104327,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":69092,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192343,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1601,"mean":3.82415125,"rank":694,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":644,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1601,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116,"mean":2.7141739130435,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":59,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
