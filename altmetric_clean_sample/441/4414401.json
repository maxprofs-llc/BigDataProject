This article presents selected findings from a Heideggerian hermeneutic phenomenological study which aimed to describe the lived experience of bereaved parents who experienced the death of a child due to cancer. Conversational interviews were conducted with six parents who experienced the death of a young child due to cancer at least one year prior to participation. The nature of parental bereavement was revealed to be a new state of being into which parents enter immediately after the death of a child and which has no end point. Findings will equip health professionals and others who work with bereaved parents with a deeper understanding of the meaning of parental bereavement.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f61000323c","authors":["Christine Yvonne Denhup"],"doi":"10.1177\/0030222815598455","first_seen_on":"2015-08-19T22:55:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1541-3764"],"issue":"3","journal":"Omega: Journal of Death & Dying","last_mentioned_on":1440047684,"links":["http:\/\/ome.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2015\/08\/04\/0030222815598455.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ome.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2015\/08\/04\/0030222815598455.full.pdf","pmid":"28038508","pubdate":"2015-08-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"0030222815598455","subjects":["ethics"],"title":"A New State of Being The Lived Experience of Parental Bereavement","type":"article","volume":"74","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lived-experience-parental-bereavement"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.95,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5565912,"mean":6.3304610756451,"rank":2375647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":3186458,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5565912,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192294,"mean":9.1841356679651,"rank":78494,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":113653,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192294,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201,"mean":2.41245,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":138,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.1625,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":4},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"PG":1,"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BCC4PC\/statuses\/634136591766786048","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4414401],"posted_on":"2015-08-19T22:55:19+00:00","author":{"name":"BCC Palliative Care","url":"http:\/\/bc-cpc.ca","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/905539797455781888\/5Pj3tGtQ_normal.jpg","description":"BC Centre for Palliative Care: Education, evidence-based practice & policy development; research, better care, community.
