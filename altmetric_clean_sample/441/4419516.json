We retrospectively reviewed the electronic records of all singleton-pregnancy women who delivered vaginally (vertex presentation) during the 2\u00a0years prior to and 1\u00a0year following the workshop to assess the workshop's effect on the rate of detection of obstetric anal sphincter injuries.\nOverall, 20,484 women met the inclusion criteria during the study period and were eligible for final analysis. There were no significant differences in patient's characteristics between the groups. Women in the pre-workshop group had a higher rate of obstetric anal sphincter injuries than the post-workshop group (0.4 vs. 0.2\u00a0%, p\u2009=\u20090.005). On multivariate analysis, factors independently associated with a decreased risk for obstetric anal sphincter injuries were deliveries in the post-workshop period (odds ratio 0.43, 95\u00a0% confidence interval 0.24-0.79, p\u2009=\u20090.006), parity (odds ratio 0.37, 95\u00a0% confidence interval 0.25-0.54, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and spontaneous vaginal delivery (odds ratio 0.43, 95\u00a0% confidence interval 0.26-0.71, p\u2009=\u20090.001).\nA proper detection of obstetric anal sphincter injuries may depend on the experience of the assessor. A structured hands-on workshop is important to avoid over diagnosis third-degree perineal tears.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b2e","authors":["Haim Krissi","Amir Aviram","Liran Hiersch","Eran Ashwal","Ram Eitan","Yoav Peled"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00384-015-2365-9","first_seen_on":"2015-08-21T06:30:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-1262"],"journal":"International Journal of Colorectal Disease","last_mentioned_on":1440138587,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00384-015-2365-9"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00384-015-2365-9.pdf","pmid":"26293790","pubdate":"2015-08-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Hepatology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Proctology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgery","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Structured hands-on workshop decreases the over-detection rate of obstetrical anal sphincter injuries","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structured-handson-workshop-decreases-overdetection-rate-obstetrical-anal-sphincter-injuries"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5568281,"mean":6.3316453235122,"rank":4642316,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5568281,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192579,"mean":9.2193186864544,"rank":154236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192579,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":648,"mean":1.349400309119,"rank":338,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":648,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":0.80655737704918,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SurgeryScience\/statuses\/634613347338420225","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4419516],"posted_on":"2015-08-21T06:29:47+00:00","author":{"name":"Surgical Research","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/552556384688939009\/rWmyj-8R_normal.jpeg","description":"Latest surgical research journal papers as they're published | Academic updates and CME | @DrEdFitzgerald","id_on_source":"SurgeryScience","tweeter_id":"2707749445","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2180},"tweet_id":"634613347338420225"}]}}
