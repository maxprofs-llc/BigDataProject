This assay can be used to identify proteins associated with a specific region of the genome, or the opposite, to identify the many regions of the genome associated with a particular protein. The ChIP assay can also be used to analyze binding of transcription factors, transcription cofactors, DNA replication factors, and DNA repair proteins. Here we describe a useful ChIP-qPCR protocol to examine the interaction of NFkB with the VEGF promoter in adult rat primary cardiomyocytes that have been mechanically stretched after attaching to the extracellular matrix protein laminin.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd3b","authors":["Walton, Chad B","Matter, Michelle L"],"doi":"10.1007\/978-1-4939-2917-7_6","first_seen_on":"2015-08-20T11:18:56+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms"],"issns":["1940-6029"],"journal":"Methods in molecular biology","last_mentioned_on":1440069519,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26285747?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26285747","pubdate":"2015-08-20T22:01:33+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay: Examining the Interaction of NFkB with the VEGF Promoter.","type":"article","volume":"1332"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5565869,"mean":6.3306718599876,"rank":4640393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5565869,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192345,"mean":9.1926583932954,"rank":154015,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192345,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4337,"mean":1.478545202952,"rank":2820,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4337,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111,"mean":2.9472727272727,"rank":77,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/epigen_papers\/statuses\/634323658140323840","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4416612],"posted_on":"2015-08-20T11:18:39+00:00","author":{"name":"epigenetics_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Epigenetics","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/471205704921931776\/wSQqKYz8_normal.jpeg","description":"Chromatin & epigenetics paper feed from #Pubmed and #Arxiv - hear it here first!
