The Cardiff model generated outputs including macrovascular and microvascular complications, diabetes-specific mortality, costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Cost and QALYs were estimated with a time horizon of 40 years at a discount rate of 3% from a societal perspective.\nCompared with insulin glargine plus OAD treatments, patients on exenatide BID plus OAD gained 1.88 QALYs, at an incremental cost saving of Chinese Renminbi (RMB) 114,593 (i.e., cost saving of RMB 61078\/QALY). The cost-effectiveness results were robust to various sensitivity analyses including probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The variables with the most impact on incremental cost-effectiveness ratio included HbA1c level at baseline, health utilities decrement and BMI at baseline.\nCompared with insulin glargine QD, exenatide BID as add-on therapy to OAD is a cost-effective treatment in Chinese patients inadequately controlled by OAD treatments.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d4f","authors":["Deng, Jing","Gu, Shuyan","Shao, Hui","Dong, Hengjin","Zou, Dajin","Shi, Lizheng"],"doi":"10.3111\/13696998.2015.1067622","first_seen_on":"2015-08-20T11:11:31+00:00","issns":["1941-837X"],"journal":"Journal of Medical Economics","last_mentioned_on":1448003187,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3111\/13696998.2015.1067622?ai=90m&mi=49zapg&af=R","http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3111\/13696998.2015.1067622?ai=90m&mi=6zgfdo&af=R&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.3111\/13696998.2015.1067622?ai=1n83w&mi=ianpxd&af=R"],"pmid":"26134916","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Economics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["healthservices"],"title":"Cost-effectiveness analysis of exenatide twice daily (BID) vs insulin glargine once daily (QD) as add-on therapy in Chinese patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled by oral therapies","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/costeffectiveness-analysis-exenatide-twice-daily-bid-vs-insulin-glargine-once-daily-qd-addon-therapy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6588189,"mean":6.1136806244756,"rank":4632405,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1714160,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6588189,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":198260,"mean":9.3006514307045,"rank":128053,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":60678,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":198260,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":628,"mean":2.6248452950558,"rank":294,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":628,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.9752857142857,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
