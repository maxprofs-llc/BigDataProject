Prior work has demonstrated clear impacts of stress upon basic cognitive function: biasing attention toward unexpected and potentially threatening information and instantiating a negative affective bias. However, the impact that these changes have on higher-order, executive, decision-making processes is unclear. In this study, we examined the impact of a translational within-subjects stress induction (threat of unpredictable shock) on two well-established executive decision-making biases: the framing effect (N = 83), and temporal discounting (N = 36). In both studies, we demonstrate (a) clear subjective effects of stress, and (b) clear executive decision-making biases but (c) no impact of stress on these decision-making biases. Indeed, Bayes factor analyses confirmed substantial preference for decision-making models that did not include stress. We posit that while stress may induce subjective mood change and alter low-level perceptual and action processes (Robinson et al., 2013c), some higher-level executive processes remain unperturbed by these impacts. As such, although stress can induce a transient affective biases and altered mood, these need not result in poor financial decision-making.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc1b","authors":["Robinson, Oliver Joe","Bond, Rebecca L","Roiser, Jonathan P","Robinson, Oliver J.","Bond, Rebecca L.","Roiser, Jonathan P."],"doi":"10.3389\/fpsyg.2015.01315","first_seen_on":"2015-08-20T13:12:22+00:00","funders":["niehs","mrc"],"issns":["1664-1078"],"journal":"Frontiers in Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1460880273,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpsyg.2015.01315\/abstract#","http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpsyg.2015.01315\/abstract","http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpsyg.2015.01315\/full"],"pmid":"26441705","pubdate":"2015-08-20T20:15:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"title":"The impact of threat of shock on the framing effect and temporal discounting: executive functions unperturbed by acute stress?","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-threat-shock-framing-effect-temporal-discounting-executive-functions-unperturbed-acute-stress"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.45,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7560115,"mean":6.5270342886323,"rank":1726528,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":5824421,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7560115,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":226869,"mean":8.6552634042704,"rank":61962,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":164444,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":226869,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6832,"mean":10.617745571659,"rank":2626,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4183,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6832,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":553,"mean":10.326775362319,"rank":190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":360,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":553,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
