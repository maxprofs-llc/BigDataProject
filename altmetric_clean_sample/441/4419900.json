Plastic surgeons traditionally have played a significant role in the care of burn patients; however, this may be evolving. We aim to examine the role and employment satisfaction of plastic surgeons in burn surgery.\nMembers of the American Society of Plastic Surgery with available contact information and US senior plastic surgery residents were asked to complete a survey examining practice profiles and employment satisfaction. Responses were analyzed between groups stating that their practice did and did not involve burn surgery.\nOf the 573 attending respondents, 135 (23.6%) indicated that part of their practice included burn surgery. Nineteen (41.9%) residents indicated they desired their practice to include burn surgery. About 41.9% of respondents with less than 3 years of experience, 25% with between 3 and 10 years of experience, and 21.7% with greater than 10 years of experience practiced burn surgery. Twenty-one (15.3%) respondents were completely satisfied with their practice, 62 (45.3%) were mostly satisfied, and 36 (26.3%) were satisfied. Fourteen (10.2%) respondents were mostly dissatisfied and 4 (2.9%) were completely dissatisfied (P = 0.0315).\nDespite residents' interest and junior plastic surgeons' involvement in burn surgery, the role of burn surgery in responding plastic surgeons' practices diminished over time. Those practicing burn surgery are less likely to be satisfied and more likely to be dissatisfied with their practice. Plastic surgeons should therefore examine their role in burn surgery to optimize their desired involvement and satisfaction within the field.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a2c","authors":["Koltz, Peter F","Frey, Jordan D","Bell, Derek E"],"doi":"10.1097\/sap.0000000000000573","first_seen_on":"2015-08-21T09:41:36+00:00","issns":["1536-3708","0148-7043"],"issue":"3","journal":"Annals of Plastic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1441628311,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/annalsplasticsurgery\/Abstract\/2015\/09000\/The_Evolving_Role_of_Members_of_the_American_Board.9.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/annalsplasticsurgery\/2015\/09000\/The_Evolving_Role_of_Members_of_the_American_Board.9.pdf","pmid":"26101984","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"287","subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"The Evolving Role of Members of the American Board of Plastic Surgery in Burn Surgery","type":"article","volume":"75","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evolving-role-members-american-board-plastic-surgery-burn-surgery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6305233,"mean":5.8140188113625,"rank":5369584,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6305233,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193619,"mean":9.2199388589904,"rank":155256,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193619,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2142,"mean":0.93215787015413,"rank":755,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2142,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":0.78981481481481,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnnalsofPlSrgy\/statuses\/634661556354093056","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4419900],"posted_on":"2015-08-21T09:41:21+00:00","author":{"name":"APSOnlineJrl","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1611398882\/APS_Cover_-_Twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Editor-in-Chief: William C.
