This soluble protein has been shown to enhance leukocyte migration and adhesion, and its circulatory level is increased in inflammatory states. In this pilot study, we used RNA-Seq to examine the splicing pattern of PLAUR in omental adipose tissues from obese and lean individuals. Of the three transcript variants of the PLAUR gene, only the proportion of suPLAUR (transcript variant 2) increases in obesity. After removing the effects of gender and age, the expression of suPLAUR is positively correlated with body mass index. This observation was validated using RT-qPCR with an independent cohort of samples. Additionally, in our RNA-Seq differential expression analysis, we also observed, in obese adipose tissues, an up-regulation of genes encoding other proteins involved in the process of chemotaxis and leukocyte adhesion; of particular interest is the integrin beta 2 (ITGB2) that is known to interact with suPLAUR in leukocyte adhesion. These findings suggest an important role for suPLAUR in the recruitment of immune cells to obese adipose tissue, in the pathogenesis of obesity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000c44","authors":["Ng, Hien Fuh","Chin, Kin Fah","Chan, Kok-Gan","Ngeow, Yun Fong"],"doi":"10.1139\/gen-2015-0028","first_seen_on":"2015-08-19T10:03:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1480-3321"],"journal":"Genome","last_mentioned_on":1439978584,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26284904?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26284904","pubdate":"2015-08-19T22:00:14+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural Biotechnology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"The mRNA expression of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor in human adipose tissue is positively correlated with body mass index.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mrna-expression-soluble-urokinase-plasminogen-activator-surface-receptor-human-adipose-tissue-positi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5561689,"mean":6.3273669173834,"rank":4636960,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5561689,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192234,"mean":9.1833503404723,"rank":153916,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192234,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":362,"mean":2.6795235457064,"rank":255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":362,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.6392857142857,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RNA_seq\/statuses\/633942249244487680","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4411505],"posted_on":"2015-08-19T10:03:04+00:00","author":{"name":"RNA_seq","url":"http:\/\/genomics.cruk.cam.ac.uk\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/520297032267747328\/-Xsy4uCB_normal.png","description":"A PubMed RSS feed for RNA-seq [title\/abstract], by dlvr.it,  http:\/\/bit.ly\/1qv7gmS, and @CIgenomics","id_on_source":"RNA_seq","tweeter_id":"2820227945","geo":{"lt":52.2,"ln":0.11667,"country":"GB"},"followers":1834},"tweet_id":"633942249244487680"}]}}
