Preliminary work is reported on a novel non-invasive technique, microbubble void imaging, which is based on ultrasound and controlled destruction of microbubble contrast agents, permitting flow visualisation and quantification of flow-induced mixing in large vessels. The generation of microbubble voids can be controlled both spatially and temporally using ultrasound parameters within the safety limits. Three different model vessel geometries-straight, planar-curved and helical-with known effects on the flow field and mixing were chosen to evaluate the technique. A high-frame-rate ultrasound system with plane wave transmission was used to acquire the contrast-enhanced ultrasound images, and an entropy measure was calculated to quantify mixing. The experimental results were cross-compared between the different geometries and with computational fluid dynamics. The results indicated that the technique is able to quantify the degree of mixing within the different configurations, with a helical geometry generating the greatest mixing, and a straight geometry, the lowest. There is a high level of concordance between the computational fluid dynamics and experimental results. The technique could also serve as a flow visualisation tool.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036d2","authors":["Leow, Chee Hau","Iori, Francesco","Corbett, Richard","Duncan, Neill","Caro, Colin","Vincent, Peter","Tang, Meng-Xing"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ultrasmedbio.2015.06.023","first_seen_on":"2015-08-19T03:14:03+00:00","funders":["niehs","bhf"],"issns":["0301-5629","1879-291X"],"journal":"Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology","last_mentioned_on":1440468239,"links":["http:\/\/www.umbjournal.org\/article\/S0301-5629(15)00423-8\/fulltext","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0301562915004238"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.umbjournal.org\/article\/S0301562915004238\/pdf","pmid":"26297515","pubdate":"2015-08-25T22:01:58+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Microbubble Void Imaging: A Non-invasive Technique for Flow Visualisation and Quantification of Mixing in Large Vessels Using Plane Wave Ultrasound and Controlled Microbubble Contrast Agent Destruction","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microbubble-void-imaging-noninvasive-technique-flow-visualisation-quantification-mixing-large-vessel"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5526446,"mean":6.3981344242107,"rank":2462692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":3001691,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5526446,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192543,"mean":9.1839836918698,"rank":81540,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":107556,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192543,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":377,"mean":1.899579787234,"rank":92,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":284,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":377,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":4.8568181818182,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
