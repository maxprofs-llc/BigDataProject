To develop effective devices, the interactions that occur between bacteria and nanofibers with different morphological and physicochemical properties need to be investigated. This paper explores the influence of fiber surface chemistry on bacterial behavior. Different chemical functionalities were generated on the surface of electrospun polystyrene nanofibers through plasma polymerization of four monomers (acrylic acid, allylamine, 1,7-octadiene, and 1,8-cineole). The interactions of Escherichia coli with the surface modified fibers were investigated through a combination of scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Fiber wettability, surface charge, and chemistry were found to affect the ability of bacterial cells to attach and proliferate throughout the nanofiber meshes. The highest proportion of viable cells attachment occurred on the hydrophilic amine rich coating, followed by the hydrophobic octadiene. The acrylic acid coating rich in carboxyl groups showed a significantly lower attraction of bacterial cells. The 1,8-cineole retained the antibacterial activity of the monomer, resulting with a high proportion of dead isolated cells attached onto the fibers. Results showed that the surface chemistry properties of nanofibrous membranes can be strategically tuned to control bacterial behavior.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5693cf058f610004b26","authors":["Martina Abrigo","Peter Kingshott","Sally L.
