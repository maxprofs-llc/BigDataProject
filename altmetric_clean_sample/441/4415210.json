Eighty-two patients with breast cancer and 50 patients with cancer of unknown primary site served as disease controls, and 84 matched for age and sex alleged healthy individuals served as healthy controls.\nColorectal cancer patients presented more sleep difficulties compared to healthy participants but fewer than patients with breast cancer and cancer of unknown primary site. Colorectal cancer patients' trouble falling asleep (p\u00a0=\u00a00.033) and wakening up early in the morning (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) deteriorated over time. Sleep that was restless or disturbed was independently associated with low SOC (p\u00a0=\u00a00.046) and maladaptive defenses (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008). Anxiety symptoms (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) predicted deterioration in trouble falling asleep, while depressive symptoms (p\u00a0=\u00a00.022) and self-sacrificing defense style (p\u00a0=\u00a00.049) predicted deterioration in wakening up early in the morning.\nPsychological parameters and coping with health stressors capacities are independently associated with sleep difficulties in colorectal cancer patients, indicating the need for psychological interventions aiming at improving adjustment to the disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002709","authors":["Thomas Hyphantis","Panagiota Goulia","Ioannis Zerdes","Solomis Solomou","Elias Andreoulakis","Andr\u00e9 F.
