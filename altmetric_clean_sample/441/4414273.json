His oxygen saturation improved with supine positioning, however, which is consistent with platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome. This improved with overnight intravenous hydration. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: In patients with hypoxia and paradoxical improvement in oxygen saturation with supine positioning, consider platypnea-orthodeoxia as a potential cause.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d74","authors":["Ducey, Stephen","Cooper, Jeffrey"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jemermed.2015.06.020","first_seen_on":"2015-08-19T21:51:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0736-4679"],"journal":"Journal of Emergency Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1442496884,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26281807?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26281807"],"pmid":"26281807","pubdate":"2015-08-19T22:01:34+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["emergencymedicine"],"title":"Hypovolemia Resulting in Platypnea-orthodeoxia Syndrome.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hypovolemia-resulting-platypneaorthodeoxia-syndrome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6360702,"mean":5.8381566509736,"rank":2308198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4023107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6360702,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194507,"mean":9.1777160190431,"rank":74115,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":118877,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194507,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1394,"mean":5.8498047379756,"rank":730,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":649,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1394,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":5.8744651162791,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/hypoxiapapers\/statuses\/634120555541565440","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4414273],"posted_on":"2015-08-19T21:51:36+00:00","author":{"name":"Hypoxia Adaptation","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/491585034201989120\/716F2y0d_normal.png","description":"A feed for hypoxia related papers published in NCBI, ArXiv, bioArxiv, and PeerJ","id_on_source":"hypoxiapapers","tweeter_id":"2669362848","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":407},"tweet_id":"634120555541565440"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NebraskaEM\/statuses\/644352968100155392","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4414273],"posted_on":"2015-09-17T03:31:33+00:00","author":{"name":"UNMC Emergency Med","url":"http:\/\/www.unmc.edu\/emergency","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/555471946725355521\/XNAZLqbS_normal.png","description":"PGY1-3 EM residency program at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. #FOAMed Supporter.
