However, the efficacy of AT and its side effects have not been assessed. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies related to the effectiveness of AT for functional dyspepsia.\nThis study is a systemic review and meta-analysis. Seven electronic databases, including those in the English and Chinese languages, were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials of AT for functional dyspepsia through November 2012. There were no language restrictions.\nRandomized controlled trials (RCT) AT compared with placebo control or a comparative intervention were considered. The methodological qualities of the studies were evaluated using the risk of bias (ROB). Subgroups were analyzed according to the kinds of controls.\nThe primary outcomes were symptom scores. These included visual analogue scale (VAS) and Nepean Dyspepsia Index (NDI). Secondary outcomes were the total effective rate and adverse effects.\nTwenty studies, including 1423 individual cases, were systematically reviewed. The risk of bias was high. Compared to sham AT, AT was associated with a significant positive effect in patients with functional dyspepsia (2.66, 95% CI 1.85-3.82). AT also improved symptoms for functional dyspepsia (1.18, 95% CI 1.01-2.60) compared to GI tract regulators on total effective rate. In addition, two articles produced a scale in favor of AT compared to medication (0.54, 95% CI 0.18-0.90). Two RCTs reported minimal AT-related adverse events.\nThe evidence suggests that AT is effective for functional dyspepsia. However, well-planned, long-term studies are necessary to evaluate the efficacy of AT for functional dyspepsia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000582a","authors":["Kim, Ka-Na","Chung, Sun-Yong","Cho, Seung-Hun"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ctim.2015.07.007","endpage":"766","first_seen_on":"2015-08-20T19:31:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0965-2299","1873-6963","09652299"],"issue":"6","journal":"Complementary Therapies in Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1470005740,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0965229915001132","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26645513","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26645513\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ctim.2015.07.007","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26645513"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.complementarytherapiesinmedicine.com\/article\/S0965229915001132\/pdf","pmid":"26645513","pubdate":"2015-12-10T17:22:40+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Nursing","Health Professions"],"startpage":"759","subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"Efficacy of acupuncture treatment for functional dyspepsia: A systematic review and meta-analysis","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/efficacy-acupuncture-treatment-functional-dyspepsia-systematic-review-metaanalysis-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8161363,"mean":6.8964925866473,"rank":991034,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7168779,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8161363,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230104,"mean":8.8418585416096,"rank":36696,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":193331,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230104,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":653,"mean":7.5207699386503,"rank":137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":516,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":653,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":3.5004210526316,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":6,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1,"ES":1,"US":2,"AU":1},"mendeley":{"AU":1,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MorganWintonND\/statuses\/634447599894790144","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4418215],"posted_on":"2015-08-20T19:31:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Morgan Winton, ND","url":"http:\/\/www.morganwinton.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/583319636629827584\/lnMcKO2B_normal.jpg","description":"Naturopathic Doctor in Toronto","id_on_source":"MorganWintonND","tweeter_id":"34294839","geo":{"lt":43.70011,"ln":-79.4163,"country":"CA"},"followers":172},"tweet_id":"634447599894790144"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OHolisticW\/statuses\/674991496165253122","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4418215],"posted_on":"2015-12-10T16:38:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Holistic Wellness","url":"http:\/\/www.ottawaholisticwellness.ca","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/423534481090150400\/ELbzUa4O_normal.jpeg","description":"The #Ottawa #Holistic #Wellness Centre.
