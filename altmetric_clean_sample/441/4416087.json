We have reported that IFN-\u03b3 enhances Fc\u03b3R-dependent ROS production. The aim of this study was to extend these observations by investigating the effect of IFN-\u03b3 on the biological responses of huMCs to Staphylococcus aureus. We found that exposure of huMCs to S. aureus generated intra- and extra-cellular ROS, which were enhanced in the presence of IFN-\u03b3. IFN-\u03b3 also promoted bacteria killing, \u03b2-hexosaminidase release and eicosanoid production. IFN-\u03b3 similarly increased expression of mRNAs encoding CCL1-CCL4, GM-CSF, TNF-\u03b1 and CXCL8 in S. aureus-stimulated huMCs. The ability of IFN-\u03b3 to increase CXCL8 and GM-CSF protein levels was confirmed by ELISA. Fibronectin or an integrin-\u03b21 blocking Ab completely abrogated IFN-\u03b3-dependent S. aureus binding and reduced S. aureus-dependent CXCL8 secretion. These data demonstrate that IFN-\u03b3 primes huMCs for enhanced anti-bacterial and pro-inflammatory responses to S. aureus, partially mediated by integrin-\u03b21 .
