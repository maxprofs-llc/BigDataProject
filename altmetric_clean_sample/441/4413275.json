The main obstacle to siRNA drugs - their delivery into the target cell cytosol - has been overcome to allow suppression of liver gene expression. Here, we review the results of recent clinical trials of siRNA therapeutics, which show efficient and durable gene knockdown in the liver, with signs of promising clinical outcomes and little toxicity. We also discuss the barriers to more widespread applications that target tissues besides the liver and the most promising avenues to overcome them.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f61000316a","authors":["Wittrup, Anders","Lieberman, Judy","Anders Wittrup","Judy Lieberman"],"doi":"10.1038\/nrg3978","endpage":"552","first_seen_on":"2015-08-19T15:57:56+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1471-0064","1471-0056"],"issue":"9","journal":"Nature Reviews Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1479255754,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26281785?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nrg\/journal\/v16\/n9\/full\/nrg3978.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nrg\/journal\/v16\/n9\/full\/nrg3978.html?WT.mc_id=FBK_NatureReviews","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nrg\/journal\/v16\/n9\/abs\/nrg3978.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nrg\/journal\/v16\/n9\/box\/nrg3978_BX4.html","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4756474"],"pmid":"26281785","pubdate":"2015-08-19T22:01:35+00:00","publisher":"NIH Public Access","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Disease genetics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"RNAi","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"543","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Knocking down disease: a progress report on siRNA therapeutics","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/knocking-down-disease-progress-report-sirna-therapeutics"},"altmetric_score":{"score":18.6,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":18.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7895896,"mean":6.6834796506229,"rank":417686,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7477585,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7895896,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228386,"mean":8.7037784705651,"rank":18009,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":210347,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228386,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1703,"mean":14.827305522914,"rank":342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":1361,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1703,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":18.94687804878,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":6,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":20,"Researcher":58,"Student  > Ph.
