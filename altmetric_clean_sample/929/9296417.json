Imaging findings included thin-walled bilobulated or oval-shape cysts located between the diaphragm and right lobe of the liver. Treatment consisted of percutaneous drainage in 17 children and was successful in all. Cysts disappeared completely in 12 of these 17 children (70.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 44-90%). Mean volume reduction was 98%. No complication or mortality was seen. The other 13 children were followed with US without treatment. In 4 of these 13 children (30.8%, 95% CI 9-61%), cysts spontaneously decreased in size. No cyst increased in size.\nIn children with typical imaging findings, percutaneous drainage appears safe and effective when treatment is deemed necessary.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032b4","authors":["Guven Kahriman","Nevzat Ozcan","Serap Dogan","Adnan Bayram"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00247-016-3658-z","endpage":"1551","first_seen_on":"2016-07-07T17:32:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-1998"],"issue":"11","journal":"Pediatric Radiology","last_mentioned_on":1475158997,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00247-016-3658-z","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00247-016-3658-z"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00247-016-3658-z.pdf","pmid":"27350378","pubdate":"2016-06-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Imaging \/ Radiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neuroradiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nuclear Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pediatrics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ultrasound","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1546","subjects":["radiology","radiotherapy","pediatrics"],"title":"Imaging findings and management of diaphragmatic mesothelial cysts in children","type":"article","volume":"46","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/imaging-findings-management-diaphragmatic-mesothelial-cysts-children"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451184,"mean":7.1040239874029,"rank":4516353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2354285,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451184,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263344,"mean":11.710217283163,"rank":142382,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":95870,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263344,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":815,"mean":2.338914004914,"rank":430,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":302,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":815,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":1.7707317073171,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PedRadJournal\/statuses\/751023343785082880","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9296417],"posted_on":"2016-07-07T12:01:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Pediatric Radiology","url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/journal\/247","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/692888586954223617\/wTZvgxbf_normal.jpg","description":"The official Twitter feed for the journal Pediatric Radiology (Springer)","id_on_source":"PedRadJournal","tweeter_id":"4828229012","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":579},"tweet_id":"751023343785082880"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/sonocanada\/statuses\/781499593749991425","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9296417],"posted_on":"2016-09-29T14:23:17+00:00","author":{"name":"Sonographers.ca","url":"http:\/\/www.sonographers.ca","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/839605472697049088\/_uwSAqyd_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"sonocanada","tweeter_id":"3061719936","geo":{"lt":49.24966,"ln":-123.11934,"country":"CA"},"followers":152},"tweet_id":"781499593749991425"}]}}
