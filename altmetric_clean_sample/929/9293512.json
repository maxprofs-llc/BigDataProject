In cases of death from a cut-throat, distinguishing the cause is one of the important functions in crime investigation. The features that differentiate suicidal and homicidal cut-throat injuries are the presence of hesitation cuts, depth of wound, signs of struggle, edges of the wound, etc. In the case of a suicidal cut-throat, it is not uncommon to find hesitation cuts but in a homicidal cut-throat, it is uncommon. We present a case of a homicidal cut-throat injury but with hesitation cuts and tailing over the neck, unlike the classical description of homicidal cut-throat injury. This resulted from a curved, sharp and moderately heavy weapon.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f610008148","authors":["Kumar S, Ajay","Kumar Ms, Vinay","Babu, Yp Raghavendra","Prasad, Mahadeshwara"],"doi":"10.1177\/0025817216656582","first_seen_on":"2016-07-07T13:23:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2042-1834","0025-8172"],"issue":"3","journal":"Medico-Legal Journal","last_mentioned_on":1467886231,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27381317"],"pmid":"27381317","pubdate":"2016-07-05T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["jurisprudence"],"title":"A case of \"atypical homicidal\" cut-throat injury","type":"article","volume":"84"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8019263,"mean":6.7829620361534,"rank":6083822,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1079172,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8019263,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260011,"mean":11.554925433637,"rank":182688,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":41571,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260011,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73,"mean":5.5939722222222,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/non_sig\/statuses\/750995402325884928","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9293512],"posted_on":"2016-07-07T10:10:31+00:00","author":{"name":"Non Significance","url":"http:\/\/www.nonsignificance.blogspot.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/625220656972591104\/CcGAh_21_normal.jpg","description":"Failed Phd-student in neuroscience...","id_on_source":"non_sig","tweeter_id":"3382196146","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":578},"tweet_id":"750995402325884928"}]}}
