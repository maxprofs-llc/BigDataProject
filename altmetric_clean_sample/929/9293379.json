CIK cells induced from peripheral blood were stimulated by TEXs. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was performed to determine the phenotypes of TEX-CIK and N-CIK (normal CIK) cells. The concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and perforin in the culture medium supernatant were examined by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. A CCK-8 kit was used to evaluate the cytotoxic activity of the CIK cells to the RBE cell line.\nThe concentrations of TNF-\u03b1 and perforin of the group TEX-CIK were 138.61 pg\/ml and 2.41 ng\/ml, respectively, lower than those of the group N-CIK 194.08 pg\/ml (P<0.01) and 3.39 ng\/ml (P<0.05). The killing rate of the group TEX-CIK was 33.35%, lower than that of the group N-CIK (47.35% (P<0.01)). The population of CD3(+), CD8(+), NK (CD56(+)), and CD3(+)CD56(+) cells decreased in the TEX-CIK group ((63.2\u00b16.8)%, (2.5\u00b11.0)%, (0.53\u00b10.49)%, (0.45\u00b10.42)%) compared with the N-CIK group ((90.3\u00b17.3)%, (65.7\u00b13.3)%, (4.2\u00b11.2)%, (15.2\u00b12.7)%), P<0.01.\nOur results suggest that RBE cells-derived exosomes inhibit the antitumor activity of CIK cells by down-regulating the population of CD3(+), CD8(+), NK (CD56(+)), and CD3(+)CD56(+) cells and the secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and perforin. TEX may play an important role in cholangiocarcinoma immune escape.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f34","authors":["Chen, Jiong-Huang","Xiang, Jian-Yang","Ding, Guo-Ping","Cao, Li-Ping"],"doi":"10.1631\/jzus.b1500266","first_seen_on":"2016-07-07T13:14:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1862-1783"],"issue":"7","journal":"Journal of Zhejiang University - Science B","last_mentioned_on":1467885810,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27381730?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC4940629","pmid":"27381730","pubdate":"2016-07-07T22:00:29+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Veterinary","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","biology"],"title":"Cholangiocarcinoma-derived exosomes inhibit the antitumor activity of cytokine-induced killer cells by down-regulating the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and perforin.","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cholangiocarcinomaderived-exosomes-inhibit-antitumor-activity-cytokineinduced-killer-cells-downregul"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8019263,"mean":6.7829620361534,"rank":6940645,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8019263,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260011,"mean":11.554928318142,"rank":218442,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260011,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":256,"mean":5.5633254901961,"rank":170,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":256,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
