The total Hg input to the farm reached 1.45\u00a0gHg\u00a0ha(-1)\u00a0year(-1), from which 0.21 gHg\u00a0ha(-1)\u00a0year(-1) was exported out as fish biomass, ultimately resulting in an emission factor of 1.24 gHg\u00a0ha(-1)\u00a0year(-1) for the reservoir or approximately 8.27 mgHg\u00a0ton\u00a0fish(-1)\u00a0year(-1) produced. Most of the input came from aquafeeds with concentrations varying from 1.4 to 31.1\u00a0ng\u00a0g(-1), depending on the type of aquafeed. The Hg concentrations in fish were very low and varied from 1.0 to 2.9\u00a0ng\u00a0g(-1). These values are two orders of magnitude lower than the legal limit for human consumption. The estimated total annual discharge of Hg from farming into the reservoir is 174\u00a0g for 18,000\u00a0tons of fish produced and may reach 387\u00a0g when the reservoir reaches its total capacity (40,000\u00a0tons), which is expected to occur in 2020. The mass balance, considering the deposition and accumulation rates, showed that approximately 40\u00a0% of the total Hg input accumulate in farm sediments (0.72\u00a0g\u00a0ha(-1)\u00a0year(-1)), which is approximately 60\u00a0% of the deposition rate estimated through the sediment traps and suggests that 0.54\u00a0gHg\u00a0ha(-1)\u00a0year(-1) could eventually be transported out of the farm to the reservoir. Notwithstanding these facts, the total annual input of Hg from fish farming to the Castanh\u00e3o Reservoir is less than 1.0\u00a0% of the total input from anthropogenic sources.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f61000653d","authors":["Oliveira, Karen Figueiredo","Lacerda, Luiz Drude","Peres, Tiago Farias","Bezerra, Moises Fernandes","da Silva Dias, Francisco Jos\u00e9"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11356-015-5102-6","endpage":"18287","first_seen_on":"2016-07-07T13:36:47+00:00","issns":["1614-7499","0944-1344"],"issue":"22","journal":"Environmental Science & Pollution Research","last_mentioned_on":1467886866,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26233746?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26233746","pubdate":"2015-08-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Atmospheric Protection\/Air Quality Control\/Air Pollution","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ecotoxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Waste Water Technology \/ Water Pollution Control \/ Water Management \/ Aquatic Pollution","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"18278","subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Emission factor and balance of mercury in fish farms in an artificial reservoir in NE Brazil","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/emission-factor-balance-mercury-fish-farms-artificial-reservoir-ne-brazil"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8019263,"mean":6.7829620361534,"rank":6083798,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1079219,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8019263,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260012,"mean":11.554861763541,"rank":182684,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":41582,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260012,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2075,"mean":2.5620887174542,"rank":1014,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":686,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2075,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":144,"mean":1.984041958042,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":144,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
