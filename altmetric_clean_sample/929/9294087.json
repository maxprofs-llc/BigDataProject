Although more than fifty pathogenic genes for congenital cataract have been reported, the genetic causes of many cataract patients remain unknown. In this study, the aim is to identify the genetic cause of a five-generation Chinese autosomal dominant congenital cataract family.\nWhole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on three affected and one unaffected member of the family, known causative genes were scanned first. Sanger sequencing was used to validate co-segregation of the candidate variant in the family. The impact on the transcript and amino acid sequences of the variant was further analyzed.\nWe identified a novel splice donor site mutation c. 2825+1G >A in EPHA2 that was absent in public and in-house databases and showed co-segregation in the family. This variant resulted in an altered splice that led to protein truncation.\nThe mutation we identified was responsible for congenital cataract in our studied family. Our findings broaden the spectrum of causative mutations in EPHA2 gene for congenital cataract and suggest that WES is an efficient strategy to scan variants in known causative genes for genetically heterogeneous diseases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002aaf","authors":["Bu, Juan","He, Sijie","Wang, Lejin","Li, Jiankang","Liu, Jing","Zhang, Xiuqing"],"doi":"10.4103\/0301-4738.185597","first_seen_on":"2016-07-07T13:50:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1998-3689"],"issue":"5","journal":"Indian Journal of Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1467887354,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27380975?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27380975","pubdate":"2016-07-07T22:00:54+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"A novel splice donor site mutation in EPHA2 caused congenital cataract in a Chinese family.","type":"article","volume":"64"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8019263,"mean":6.7829620361534,"rank":4222757,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2233808,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8019263,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260011,"mean":11.554926395139,"rank":141474,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":92692,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260011,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":654,"mean":1.0488208269525,"rank":147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":459,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":654,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":0.584375,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Exome_seq\/statuses\/751000113229606912","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9294087],"posted_on":"2016-07-07T10:29:14+00:00","author":{"name":"Exome-seq","url":"http:\/\/genomics.cruk.cam.ac.uk\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/520305836476755970\/1oHrqeyl_normal.png","description":"A PubMed RSS feed for exome, by dlvr.it, http:\/\/bit.ly\/1qv7gmS, and @CIgenomics","id_on_source":"Exome_seq","tweeter_id":"2820127624","geo":{"lt":52.2,"ln":0.11667,"country":"GB"},"followers":620},"tweet_id":"751000113229606912"}]}}
