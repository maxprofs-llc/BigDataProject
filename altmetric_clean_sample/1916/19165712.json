Although the pathogenesis of Chagas cardiomyopathy is incompletely understood, it may involve several mechanisms, including parasite-dependent myocardial damage, immune-mediated myocardial injury (induced by the parasite itself and by self-antigens), and microvascular and neurogenic disturbances. In the past three decades, a consensus has emerged that parasite persistence is crucial to the development and progression of Chagas cardiomyopathy. In this context, antiparasitic treatment in the chronic phase of Chagas disease could prevent complications related to the disease. However, according to the results of the BENEFIT trial, benznidazole seems to have no benefit for arresting disease progression in patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy. In this review, we give an update on the main pathogenic mechanisms of Chagas disease, and re-examine and discuss the results of the BENEFIT trial, together with its limitations and implications.","altmetric_jid":"56a768dd2a83eeb12a8b45de","authors":["Rassi Jr, Anis","Marin Neto, Jos\u00e9 Antonio","Rassi, Anis","Rassi Jr, Anis","Marin Neto, Jos\u00e9 Antonio","Rassi, Anis"],"doi":"10.1590\/0074-02760160334","first_seen_on":"2017-04-19T12:15:43+00:00","issns":["1678-8060","0074-0276"],"journal":"Mem\u00f3rias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz","last_mentioned_on":1487880410,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1590\/0074-02760160334"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.scielo.br\/pdf\/mioc\/v112n3\/0074-0276-mioc-0074-02760160334.pdf","pmid":"28225894","publisher":"Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Oswaldo Cruz","subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy: a review of the main pathogenic mechanisms and the efficacy of aetiological treatment following the BENznidazole Evaluation for Interrupting Trypanosomiasis (BENEFIT) trial","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chronic-chagas-cardiomyopathy-review-main-pathogenic-mechanisms-efficacy-aetiological-treatment-foll"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8261086,"mean":6.9752528681095,"rank":7144877,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8261086,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243681,"mean":12.730990315167,"rank":198505,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243681,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":594,"mean":3.0579595278246,"rank":518,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":594,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.7,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
