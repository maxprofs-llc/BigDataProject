Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine factors associated with risk of returning to the ED within 90\u00a0days.\nInjuries included fractures (45%, n\u00a0=\u00a0117); head trauma (22%, n\u00a0=\u00a058); abrasions, lacerations, or contusions (34%, n\u00a0=\u00a088); and none (22%, n\u00a0=\u00a057). Emergency care was frequently required, with 13 (5%, 95% confidence interval (CI)\u00a0=\u00a02.3-7.6%) returning within 72\u00a0hours, 35 (13%, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a09.2-17%] within 30\u00a0days, and 57 (22%, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a017-27%) within 90\u00a0days. Univariately, the odds of returning to the ED within 90\u00a0days was more than two times as high for those with head trauma as for those without (odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a02.66). This remained significant in the multivariable model, which controlled for Charlson Comorbidity Index, fractures, soft tissue injuries, and ED observation unit use.\nMore than one-third of older adults with minor head trauma from a fall will need to return to the ED in the following 90\u00a0days. These individuals should receive close attention from primary care providers. The link between minor head trauma and ED recidivism is a new finding.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f5a","authors":["Southerland, Lauren T","Stephens, Julie A","Robinson, Shari","Falk, James","Phieffer, Laura","Rosenthal, Joseph A","Caterino, Jeffrey M","Southerland, Lauren T.","Stephens, Julie A.","Rosenthal, Joseph A.","Caterino, Jeffrey M."],"doi":"10.1111\/jgs.14041","endpage":"874","first_seen_on":"2016-04-22T11:24:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1532-5415","00028614"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of the American Geriatrics Society","last_mentioned_on":1486061641,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27100582?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jgs.14041\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jgs.14041\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jgs.14041\/pdf","pmid":"27100582","pubdate":"2016-04-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"870","subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Head Trauma from Falling Increases Subsequent Emergency Department Visits More Than Other Fall-Related Injuries in Older Adults","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/jgs.14041","volume":"64","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/head-trauma-falling-increases-subsequent-emergency-department-visits-more-other-fallrelated-injuries"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8150076,"mean":6.9043957460448,"rank":4317488,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2262515,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8150076,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271120,"mean":11.4750285004,"rank":146760,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":98153,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271120,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3731,"mean":12.930796782842,"rank":3020,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":483,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3731,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105,"mean":25.83375,"rank":85,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
