The endothelial cell apoptosis elicited by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), which contributes to endothelial damage and inflammation, is a particularly important event in the early stage of atherosclerosis. However, the mechanism underlying ox-LDL-induced endothelial cell apoptosis remains unclear. Here we found that HDAC9 expression was increased at both the mRNA and protein levels accompanied by dose-dependent ox-LDL-induced endothelial cell apoptosis. Depletion of HDAC9 by its specific shRNA significantly antagonized ox-LDL-induced cell apoptosis and suppressed the expression of ox-LDL-induced inflammatory factors, such as TNF-alpha and MCP1. These data suggest that HDAC9 is an important epigenetic factor regulating ox-LDL-induced endothelial cell apoptosis and inflammatory factor expression. These results suggest that HDAC9 may participate in ox-LDL-induced endothelial damage and inflammation during atherosclerosis development.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f6100074a4","authors":["Han, Xu","Han, Xiang","Wang, Zheng","Shen, Junjun","Dong, Qiang"],"first_seen_on":"2016-04-22T12:04:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1093-4715"],"journal":"Frontiers in Bioscience","last_mentioned_on":1461326649,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27100479?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27100479","pubdate":"2016-04-22T22:00:38+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"HDAC9 regulates ox-LDL-induced endothelial cell apoptosis by participating in inflammatory reactions.","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hdac9-regulates-oxldlinduced-endothelial-cell-apoptosis-participating-inflammatory-reactions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7588328,"mean":6.5418890751503,"rank":6569801,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7588328,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266862,"mean":11.331221407399,"rank":223775,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266862,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":537,"mean":2.6189104477612,"rank":461,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":537,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":1.2117647058824,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/epigen_papers\/statuses\/723482520885428224","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6888048],"posted_on":"2016-04-22T12:04:09+00:00","author":{"name":"epigenetics_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Epigenetics","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/471205704921931776\/wSQqKYz8_normal.jpeg","description":"Chromatin & epigenetics paper feed from #Pubmed and #Arxiv - hear it here first!
