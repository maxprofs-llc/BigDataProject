However, the spread of PECS block is unclear.\nUltrasound guided PECS I and II blocks were performed in a cadaver, and the cadaver was dissected for evaluation of the spread of coloring matter.\nThe coloring matter by PECS I block was spread to the axillary region between the major and minor pectoral muscles, while PECS II block remained over the fascia of the serratus muscle from mid-clavicular line to middle axillary line. Two possible routes to the axillary region by PECS I include: dorsal to the pectoral minor muscle through the clavipectoral fascia, and over the pectoral minor muscle to the axillary sheath.\nOur cadaveric evaluation suggests that PECS I block produces more analgesia of the axillary region than PECS II. Further evaluation is needed in more cadavers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9273cf058f61000dd0b","authors":["Kikuchi, Masaru","Takaki, Shunsuke","Nomura, Takeshi","Goto, Takahisa"],"first_seen_on":"2016-04-22T12:07:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0021-4892"],"issue":"3","journal":"Masui The Japanese journal of anesthesiology","last_mentioned_on":1464949929,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27097516?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27097516?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27097516","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["anesthesiology"],"title":"[Difference in the Spread of Injectate between Ultrasound Guided Pectoral Nerve Block I and II.
