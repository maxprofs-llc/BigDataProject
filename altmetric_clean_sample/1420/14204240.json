Excessive premature atrial complexes were defined as >14 premature atrial complexes per hour and 3 or more runs of premature atrial complexes per 24 hours. During follow-up, 48-hour Holter recordings were performed after 6 and 12 months. Among patients in sinus rhythm, the association of excessive premature atrial complexes and the primary end point of recurrent stroke or death were estimated in both crude and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. We further evaluated excessive premature atrial complexes contra atrial fibrillation in relation to the primary end point.\nOf the 256 patients included, 89 had atrial fibrillation. Of the patients in sinus rhythm (n\u2009=\u2009167), 31 had excessive premature atrial complexes. During a median follow-up of 32 months, 50 patients (30% of patients in sinus rhythm) had recurrent strokes (n\u2009=\u200920) or died (n\u2009=\u200930). In both crude and adjusted models, excessive premature atrial complexes were associated with the primary end point, but not with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation. Compared with patients in atrial fibrillation, those with excessive premature atrial complexes had similarly high risks of the primary end point.\nIn patients with ischemic stroke and sinus rhythm, excessive premature atrial complexes were associated with a higher risk of recurrent stroke or death.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005ab3","authors":["Vinther, Kristina H","Tveskov, Claus","M\u00f6ller, S\u00f6ren","Auscher, Soren","Osmanagic, Armin","Egstrup, Kenneth","Kristina H.
