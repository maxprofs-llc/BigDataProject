The images were systematically reviewed specifically looking for endobag collapse, aortic thrombus compression, and aortic wall disruption according to definitions set a priori.\nThere was no perioperative mortality or endoleak after the EVAS procedure. Endobag collapse, which could potentially result in type II endoleak if occurring near a patent side branch, was seen in the endobags of 12 patients. Aortic thrombus compression, which affects the accuracy of preoperative volume measurements in predicting the amount of polymer needed to perform EVAS, was seen in 15 patients. There was one aortic wall disruption, which could potentially result in intraoperative hemorrhage, though this did not occur in this case.\nThese observations and their potential implications should help clinicians in planning and performing EVAS, as well as in interpreting postoperative imaging.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a2f","authors":["McWilliams, Richard G","Fisher, Robert K","England, Andrew","Torella, Francesco","R.
