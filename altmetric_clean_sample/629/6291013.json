Patients commonly present with significant bleeding complications that are difficult to manage due to a markedly reduced VWF half-life.\nIn two patients with severe refractory bleeding due to AVWS associated with monoclonal gammopathies (MG), we investigated the use of the immuno-modulatory drug Lenalidomide.\nIn both patients, Lenalidomide treatment resulted in significant clinical improvement, and marked increases in plasma VWF:Ag and VWF:RCo levels. This normalization in plasma VWF levels was sustained for over 2 years in both patients. Furthermore, in one patient, plasma VWF levels remain normal for at least 14 months following discontinuation of Lenalidomide therapy. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying these observations, VWFpp:VWFAg ratios were analyzed to assess VWF clearance. At enrolment, plasma VWFpp:VWFAg ratios were significantly elevated in both patients. Importantly, Lenalidomide therapy resulted in normalization in VWFpp:VWFAg ratios in both patients. These novel data suggest that Lenalidomide functions to attenuate enhanced VWF clearance in AWWS. Interestingly, in a patient with MGUS, Lenalidomide treatment was associated with a significant increase in plasma VWF levels despite no major change in paraprotein level.\nCollectively, our findings suggest that Lenalidomide constitutes a novel therapeutic option for the management of AVWS associated with MG. The biological mechanism(s) through which Lenalidomide causes a sustained increase in plasma VWF in AVWS independent of paraprotein level requires further study, but is in part modulated through inhibition of enhanced VWF clearance.
