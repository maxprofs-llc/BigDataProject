We sought to examine echocardiographic parameters that can predict VT as documented by implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) appropriate discharge. We examine echocardiographic parameters other than ejection fraction that may predict VT as recorded via rates of ICD discharge.\nAnalysis of 586 patients (469 males; mean age = 68 \u00b1 3 years; mean follow-up time of 11 \u00b1 14 months) was undertaken. Echo parameters assessed included left ventricular (LV) internal end diastolic\/systolic dimension (LVIDd, LVIDs), relative wall thickness (RWT), and left atrial (LA) size.\nThe incidence of VT was 0.22 (114 VT episodes per 528 person-years of follow-up time). Median time-to-first VT was 3.8 years. VT was documented in 79 patients (59 first VT incidence, 20 multiple). The echocardiographic parameter associated with first VT was LVIDs >4 cm (P = 0.02).\nThe main echocardiographic predictor associated with the first occurrence of VT was LVIDs >4 cm. Patients with an LVIDs >4 cm were 2.5 times more likely to have an episode of VT. Changes in these echocardiographic parameters may warrant aggressive pharmacologic therapy and implantation of an ICD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5213cf058f610003a87","authors":["John N.
