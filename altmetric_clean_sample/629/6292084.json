The solid-state structure of the developed IrC was authenticated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Notably, the iridium(III) complex exhibits intense red phosphorescence in the solid state at 298 K (\u03a6PL = 0.16) and faint emission in acetonitrile solution (\u03a6PL = 0.02). The cyanide anion binding properties with IrC in pure and aqueous acetonitrile solutions were systematically investigated using two different channels: i.e., by means of UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence. The addition of 2.0 equiv of cyanide to a solution of the iridium(III) complex in acetonitrile (c = 20 \u03bcM) visibly changes the color from orange to yellow. On the other hand, the PL intensity of IrC at 480 nm was dramatically enhanced \u223c5.36 \u00d7 10(2)-fold within 100 s along with a strong signature of a blue shift of the emission by \u223c155 nm with a detection limit of 2.16 \u00d7 10(-8) M. The cyanohydrin formation mechanism is further supported by results of a (1)H NMR titration of IrC with CN(-). As an integral part of this work, phosphorescent test strips have been constructed by impregnating Whatman filter paper with IrC for the trace detection of CN(-) in the contact mode, exhibiting a detection limit at the nanogram level (\u223c265 ng\/mL). Finally, density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations were performed to understand the electronic structure and the corresponding transitions involved in the designed phosphorescent iridium(III) complex probe and its cyanide adduct.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["K.
