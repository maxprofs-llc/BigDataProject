In vertebrates so far examined, the sex of germ cells is determined by gonadal somatic cells. However, influenced by the somatic cells, how germ cells adopt their sexual fates by intrinsic factors has long been unclear in vertebrates. We recently identified forkhead box L3 (Foxl3) as a germ cell-intrinsic factor involved in the sperm-egg fate decision in the teleost fish, medaka (Oryzias latipes). On the basis of the results obtained by the analysis offoxl3\/Foxl3 expression and loss-of-function mutants, we review when and how germ cell sex is regulated non-cell autonomously and cell-autonomously. We then discuss that the germline sex determination pathway is genetically distinct from other essential gametogenic pathways such as meiotic entry and the establishment of germline stem cells. Another extraordinary finding in thefoxl3mutant is that functional sperm can be produced in the ovary, which provides a new notion that gametogenesis can proceed irrespective of the sex of the surrounding somatic cells once the sexual identity of germ cells is established in medaka.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c6e","authors":["Toshiya Nishimura","Minoru Tanaka","Nishimura, Toshiya","Tanaka, Minoru"],"doi":"10.1095\/biolreprod.115.138271","first_seen_on":"2016-03-23T22:34:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1529-7268","0006-3363"],"journal":"Biology of Reproduction","last_mentioned_on":1458901940,"links":["http:\/\/www.biolreprod.org\/content\/early\/2016\/03\/22\/biolreprod.115.138271.abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27009043?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27009043"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biolreprod.org\/content\/early\/2016\/03\/22\/biolreprod.115.138271.full.pdf","pmid":"27009043","pubdate":"2016-03-25T12:35:46+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"The Mechanism of Germline Sex Determination in Vertebrates","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mechanism-germline-sex-determination-vertebrates"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7438587,"mean":6.4662340552314,"rank":3612796,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3638112,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7438587,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275936,"mean":10.990783699059,"rank":138686,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":126851,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275936,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2154,"mean":2.2625229911751,"rank":999,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1081,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2154,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82,"mean":1.4598765432099,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
