However, animal models of cannabinoid addiction allowing the exploration of neural correlates of cannabinoid abuse have been developed only recently. We review these models and the role of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor, the main target of natural cannabinoids, and its interaction with opioid and dopamine transmission in reward circuits. Extensive reviews on the molecular basis of cannabinoid action are available elsewhere (Piomelli et al., 2000; Schlicker and Kathmann, 2001).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e79","authors":["Rafael Maldonado","Fernando Rodr\u0131\u0301guez de Fonseca"],"doi":"20026358","first_seen_on":"2016-05-10T01:42:20+00:00","issns":["1529-2401"],"issue":"9","journal":"Journal of Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1462769725,"links":["http:\/\/www.jneurosci.org\/content\/22\/9\/3326.long"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jneurosci.org\/content\/22\/9\/3326.full.pdf","pmid":"11978807","pubdate":"2002-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Cannabinoid addiction: behavioral models and neural correlates.","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cannabinoid-addiction-behavioral-models-neural-correlates-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7672691,"mean":6.5915218985731,"rank":6639138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7672691,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267458,"mean":11.429485547209,"rank":223622,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267458,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12031,"mean":9.4503813798836,"rank":11160,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12031,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278,"mean":15.026014440433,"rank":268,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
