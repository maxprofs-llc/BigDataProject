The introduction of short forms of the SOAPP-R may save time and increase utilization by practitioners.\nTo develop and evaluate candidate SOAPP-R short forms.\nRetrospective study.\nPain centers.\nFour hundred and twenty-eight patients with chronic noncancer pain.\nSubjects had previously been administered the full-length version of the SOAPP-R and been categorized as positive or negative for aberrant medication-related behaviors via the Aberrant Drug Behavior Index (ADBI). Short forms of the SOAPP-R were developed using lasso logistic regression. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) of all forms were calculated with respect to the ADBI using the complete data set, training-test analysis, and 10-fold cross-validation. The coefficient alpha of each form was also calculated. An external set of 12 pain practitioners reviewed the forms for content.\nIn the complete data set analysis, a form of 12 items exhibited sensitivity, specificity, and AUC greater than or equal to those of the full-length SOAPP-R (which were 0.74, 0.67, and 0.76, respectively). The short form had a coefficient alpha of 0.76. In the training-test analysis and 10-fold cross-validation, it exhibited an AUC value within 0.01 of that of the full-length SOAPP-R. The majority of external practitioners reported a preference for this short form.\nThe 12-item version of the SOAPP-R has potential as a short risk screener and should be tested prospectively.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003282","authors":["Finkelman, Matthew D","Smits, Niels","Kulich, Ronald J","Zacharoff, Kevin L","Magnuson, Britta E","Chang, Hong","Dong, Jinghui","Butler, Stephen F"],"doi":"10.1093\/pm\/pnw210","first_seen_on":"2016-09-09T10:03:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1526-4637","1526-2375"],"journal":"Pain Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1473415388,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27605589?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27605589","pubdate":"2016-09-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"pnw210","subjects":["psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"Development of Short-Form Versions of the Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain-Revised (SOAPP-R): A Proof-of-Principle Study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-shortform-versions-screener-opioid-assessment-patients-painrevised-soappr-proofof-princi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8352366,"mean":7.0446264010179,"rank":6338138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1131934,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8352366,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252702,"mean":12.464142302563,"rank":178501,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":42020,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252702,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1439,"mean":8.0827121001391,"rank":1060,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":248,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1439,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":6.2509803921569,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/geneset_papers\/statuses\/774186366468968448","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[11910210],"posted_on":"2016-09-09T10:03:08+00:00","author":{"name":"GeneSetPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/848201112561831937\/OG7ARate_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"geneset_papers","tweeter_id":"3028812377","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":14},"tweet_id":"774186366468968448"}]}}
