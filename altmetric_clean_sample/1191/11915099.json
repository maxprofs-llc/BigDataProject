We recorded the number of obtainable thenar H-reflexes and their minimum latency, threshold and amplitude in each group.\nThere was a significantly more chance to elicit the H-reflex in patients with FM. H reflex threshold and minimum latency were lower in FM group but no significant difference was shown for H wave amplitude. According to our study, thenar H-reflex has 46.7% sensitivity, 86.7% specificity and 66.7% diagnostic accuracy to detect FM. It also has moderate predictive values and positive likelihood ratio but low negative likelihood ratio.\nHigher rate of thenar muscle H-reflex in fibromyalgia can be interpreted as a confirmatory finding to central sensitization theory for this disorder. Obtaining H-reflex from thenar muscles could be a helpful diagnostic tool for fibromyalgia that increases the confidence in diagnosis. Although it is a weak tool for screening because of low sensitivity, it has a relatively high specificity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6563cf058f61000917e","authors":["Azma, K","Raeissadat, S A","Hosseini, A","Mahmoudi, H","Sepehrian, M","Salehi, Z"],"first_seen_on":"2016-09-09T12:16:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0303-464X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Acta Reumatol\u00f3gica Portuguesa","last_mentioned_on":1473423327,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27606474?dopt=Abstract&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed"],"pmid":"27606474","pubdate":"2016-09-09T22:03:39+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"Thenar muscles H reflex in patients with fibromyalgia: A case control study.","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/thenar-muscles-h-reflex-patients-fibromyalgia-case-control-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8352366,"mean":7.0446264010179,"rank":6027432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2312929,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8352366,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252702,"mean":12.463962050011,"rank":164006,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":88463,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252702,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":3.2272549019608,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/justbeyucan\/statuses\/774219665832865792","license":"gnip","rt":["fmauk"],"citation_ids":[11915099],"posted_on":"2016-09-09T12:15:27+00:00","author":{"name":"Emma Duffield","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/806516949622673408\/tlLkTZkx_normal.jpg","description":"realistic dreamer","id_on_source":"justbeyucan","tweeter_id":"2823972946","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":215},"tweet_id":"774219665832865792"}]}}
