This study identifies cervical malalignment prevalence following surgical and conservative TLD treatment through 2\u00a0years.\nRetrospective analysis of a prospective, multicenter adult spinal deformity (ASD) database. CD was defined in operative and non-operative ASD patients according to the following criteria: T1 Slope minus Cervical Lordosis (T1S-CL) \u226520\u00b0, C2-C7 Cervical Sagittal Vertical Axis (cSVA) \u226540\u00a0mm, C2-C7 kyphosis >10\u00b0. Differences in rates, demographics, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) scores for Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Scoliosis Research Society Questionnaire (SRS-22r), and radiographic variables were assessed between treatment groups (Op vs. Non-Op) and follow-up periods (baseline, 1-year, 2-year).\nThree hundred and nineteen (200 Op, 199 Non-Op) ASD patients were analyzed. Op patients' CD rates at 1 and 2\u00a0years were 78.9, and 63.0\u00a0%, respectively. Non-Op CD rates were 21.1 and 37.0\u00a0% at 1 and 2\u00a0years, respectively. T1S-CL mismatch and cSVA malalignment characterized Op CD at 1 and 2\u00a0years (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Op and Non-Op CD groups had similar cervical\/global alignment at 1\u00a0year (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05 for all), but at 2\u00a0years, Op CD patients had worse thoracic kyphosis (TK), T1S-CL, CL, cSVA, C2-T3 SVA, and global SVA compared to Non-Ops (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Op CD patients had worse ODI, and SRS Activity at 1 and 2\u00a0years post-operative (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), but had greater 2-year SRS Satisfaction scores (p\u00a0=\u00a00.019).\nIn the first study to compare cervical malalignment at extended follow-up between ASD treatments, CD rates rose overall through 2\u00a0years. TLD surgery, resulting in higher CD rates characterized by T1S-CL and cSVA malalignment, produced poorer HRQoL. This information can aid in treatment method decision-making when cervical deformity is present concomitant with TLD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002870","authors":["Cyrus M. Jalai","Peter G.
