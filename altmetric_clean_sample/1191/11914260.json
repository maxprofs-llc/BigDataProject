The hydrolytic activity of cellulase in two concentrations (0.05% and 0.1%) was verified by determination of the progress of polysaccharide hydrolysis, based on viscosity measurement and reducing sugar-ends assay. The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging effect, the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and microbial reduction of Pseudomonas fluorescens, Yersinia enterocolitica, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus were studied. During the first 3 h of reaction, relative reducing sugar concentration increased progressively, and viscosity decreased rapidly. With increasing amount of enzyme from 0.05% to 0.1%, the reducing sugar concentration increased, and the viscosity decreased significantly. The scavenging effect of film-forming solutions was improved from 7.6% at time 0 and without enzyme to 52.1% for 0.1% cellulase after 20 h of reaction. A significant effect of cellulase addition and reaction time on antioxidant power of the tested film-forming solutions was also reported. Film-forming hydrosols with cellulase exhibited a bacteriostatic effect on all tested bacteria, causing a total reduction.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e6e","authors":["Zimoch-Korzycka, Anna","Bobak, \u0141ukasz","Jarmoluk, Andrzej"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijms17091436","first_seen_on":"2016-09-09T11:53:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1422-0067"],"issue":"9","journal":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1473421986,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27608008?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27608008","pubdate":"2016-09-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1436","title":"Antimicrobial and Antioxidant Activity of Chitosan\/Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose Film-Forming Hydrosols Hydrolyzed by Cellulase","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antimicrobial-antioxidant-activity-chitosanhydroxypropyl-methylcellulose-filmforming-hydrosols-hydro"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8352366,"mean":7.0446264010179,"rank":4453398,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2324971,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8352366,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252702,"mean":12.463977285408,"rank":139246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":88695,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252702,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5374,"mean":2.3877364600782,"rank":2019,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2682,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5374,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":330,"mean":2.7919817629179,"rank":142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":161,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":330,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/pseudo_papers\/statuses\/774214041140989952","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[11914260],"posted_on":"2016-09-09T11:53:06+00:00","author":{"name":"pseudomonaspapers","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/?term=pseudomonas","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/570219565901029376\/j3RfXxUz_normal.jpeg","description":"PubMed search bot for pseudomonas.
