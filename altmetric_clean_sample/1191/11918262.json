We compare the evolution map approach and its partialized extension to each other with respect to their ability to correctly infer the network topology in the presence of indirect directional couplings for various simulated experimental situations using coupled model systems. In addition, we investigate whether the partialized approach allows for additional or complementary indications of directional interactions in evolving epileptic brain networks using intracranial electroencephalographic recordings from an epilepsy patient. For such networks, both direct and indirect directional couplings can be expected, given the brain's connection structure and effects that may arise from limitations inherent to the recording technique. Our findings indicate that particularly in larger networks (number of nodes \u226b10), the partialized approach does not provide information about directional couplings extending the information gained with the evolution map approach.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024db","authors":["Thorsten Rings","Thorsten Rings","Klaus Lehnertz"],"doi":"10.1063\/1.4962295","first_seen_on":"2016-09-09T16:23:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1089-7682"],"issue":"9","journal":"Chaos","last_mentioned_on":1473430547,"links":["http:\/\/scitation.aip.org\/content\/aip\/journal\/chaos\/26\/9\/10.1063\/1.4962295?TRACK=RSS"],"pmid":"27781446","pubdate":"2016-09-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"AIP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Mathematics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Numerical And Computational Mathematics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Mathematics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Distinguishing between direct and indirect directional couplings in large oscillator networks: Partial or non-partial phase analyses?","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/distinguishing-between-direct-indirect-directional-couplings-large-oscillator-networks-partial-nonpa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8352366,"mean":7.0446264010179,"rank":7220324,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8352366,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252702,"mean":12.463908033605,"rank":210601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252702,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":945,"mean":4.7547669491525,"rank":493,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":945,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":8.016835443038,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
