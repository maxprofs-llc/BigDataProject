Detection of cancer markedly increased from 22 to 60% by co-determination of both markers (30\/50 patients). Significantly elevated levels of PSA-IgM were found in 13 out of 30 patients affected by PC with a PSA value between 4 and 10 ng\/mL and only in 4 out of 34 BPH patients in the same PSA range.\nThe results are the first evidence of the occurrence of PSA-IgM complexes in patients with prostate cancer. The gain achieved in cancer detection by using the combination of PSA and PSA-IgM suggests that PSA-IgM could be a complementary serological marker of prostate cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002499","authors":["Luca Beneduce","Tommaso Prayer-Galetti","Andrea Marcello Grimani Giustinian","Andrea Gallotta","Giovanni Betto","Francesco Pagano","Giorgio Fassina"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cdp.2007.10.005","endpage":"407","first_seen_on":"2016-09-09T11:55:01+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["0361090X","1525-1500"],"issue":"5","journal":"Cancer Detection & Prevention","last_mentioned_on":1473422065,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.cdp.2007.10.005"],"pmid":"18035503","pubdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"402","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Detection of prostate-specific antigen coupled to immunoglobulin M in prostate cancer patients","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/detection-prostatespecific-antigen-coupled-immunoglobulin-m-prostate-cancer-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8352366,"mean":7.0446264010179,"rank":2139710,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5072706,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8352366,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252703,"mean":12.463932909118,"rank":84581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":164064,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252703,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90,"mean":3.7654831460674,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":4,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Psychology":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Xeptagen","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=738512970#altmetric_citation_905824bf-29b7-49a9-9c0b-5a25cec1b568","license":"public","citation_ids":[11914297,11914297],"posted_on":"2016-09-09T11:54:25+00:00","summary":"XEPTAGEN S.p.A. is an Italian biotech company funded by venture capital in 2001 and dedicated to the discovery and validation of novel molecular markers for cancer early detection, monitoring, and evaluation of response to treatment.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=51556582","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Xeptagen","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Xeptagen"}}]}}
