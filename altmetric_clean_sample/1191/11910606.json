Here we use 15N labeling to analyze the dynamic behaviors of both pre- and post-silking N in relation to source and sink manipulation in maize plants. The results showed that the remobilization of pre-silking N started immediately after silking and the remobilized pre-silking N had a greater contribution to grain N during early grain filling, with post-silking N importance increasing during the later filling stage. The amount of post-silking N uptake was largely driven by post-silking dry matter accumulation in both grain as well as vegetative organs. Prevention of pollination during silking had less effect on post-silking N uptake, as a consequence of compensatory growth of stems, husk + cob and roots. Also, leaves continuously export N even though grain sink was removed. The remobilization efficiency of N in the leaf and stem increased with increasing grain yield (hence N requirement). It is suggested that the remobilization of N in the leaf is controlled by sink strength but not the leaf per se. Enhancing post-silking N uptake rather than N remobilization is more likely to increase grain N accumulation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Yang, Lan","Guo, Song","Chen, Qinwu","Chen, Fanjun","Yuan, Lixing","Mi, Guohua"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0162201","first_seen_on":"2016-09-09T10:23:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"9","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1473426552,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27606628?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27606628","pubdate":"2016-09-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0162201","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Use of the Stable Nitrogen Isotope to Reveal the Source-Sink Regulation of Nitrogen Uptake and Remobilization during Grain Filling Phase in Maize","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/stable-nitrogen-isotope-reveal-sourcesink-regulation-nitrogen-uptake-remobilization-during-grain-fil"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8352366,"mean":7.0446264010179,"rank":6338087,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1132071,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8352366,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252702,"mean":12.463931579218,"rank":178473,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":42097,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252702,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115446,"mean":10.623325063883,"rank":84351,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":18150,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115446,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4256,"mean":9.9317095182139,"rank":3273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":543,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4256,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
