CD is triggered by wheat gluten and related prolamines in barley and rye. Worldwide, the disease affects approximately 1\u00a0% of the general population. Clinical features of CD vary considerably. Intestinal symptoms are more common in young children. In older children extra intestinal manifestations affecting almost all organs are seen. IgA tTG antibody, upper GI endoscopy with histological analysis of multiple biopsies of the duodenum and in selected cases HLA DQ2 and DQ8 positivity and endomysial antibodies (EMA) are needed for diagnosis. Currently, the only treatment for CD is a life-long gluten-free diet (GFD). Strict avoidance of wheat, rye, barley and their derivatives will result in intestinal healing and relief of symptoms for the majority of individuals with CD. The GFD is simple in principle, however, completely eliminating all foods and ingredients containing wheat, rye, barley, and most commercial oats can be very challenging. Newly diagnosed CD children should undergo testing and treatment for micronutrient deficiencies specially iron, folic acid, vitamin D, and vitamin B12. Long-term monitoring and follow up of patients with CD is necessary.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f610007754","authors":["Kapil Garg","R K Gupta"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12098-014-1544-y","first_seen_on":"2014-08-31T06:45:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0973-7693"],"journal":"Indian Journal of Pediatrics","last_mentioned_on":1410086447,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/25172576\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25172576","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/25172576\/?i=2&from=b12%20AND%20celiac"],"pmid":"25172576","pubdate":"2014-08-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Gynecology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pediatrics","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"What a Practitioner Needs to Know About Celiac Disease?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/practitioner-needs-know-about-celiac-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7533575,"mean":6.5103292888566,"rank":2943760,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4535168,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7533575,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184616,"mean":7.5368216558787,"rank":56271,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":126805,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184616,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":615,"mean":2.2424364820847,"rank":288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":615,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.53571428571429,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
