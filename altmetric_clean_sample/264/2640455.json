Participants (n = 46) were randomly assigned to the intervention (girls, n = 4; boys, n = 19) and control groups (girls, n = 5; boys, n = 18). Belayers' and children's perceptions of efficacy were measured using specifically designed questionnaires and perceptions of competence and global self-worth were measured using Harter's (1985) Self-Perception Profile for Children for participants with an adaptive age of 8 years or higher. Children's self-efficacy and belayers' ratings of children's efficacy improved significantly, t(21) = 3.9, p = .001, d= .84 and F(2, 44) = 30.03, p < .001, respectively. The children's judgments of their athletic and social competence and global self-worth, however, did not change over time or differ from the wait-listed control group (p > .05). These results suggest that it is likely that many experiences that enhance self-efficacy may be needed to improve self-perceptions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002170","authors":["Mazzoni ER","Purves PL","Southward J","Rhodes RE","Temple VA","Mazzoni, Erin R","Purves, P Lynn","Southward, Julie","Rhodes, Ryan E","Temple, Viviene A","Erin R.
