Simultaneously genotyping of the 8 polymorph loci for genes involved in detoxication of xenobiotics and oestrogen metabolism was carried out. The increased TCR-mutant cell frequency was found to be characteristic of homozygotes of the low activity appropriated enzymes for 3 loci (HFE187, GSTM1 and MTHFR) at least. This tendency was statistically significant in case of deletion polymorphism of the GSTM1 gene: TCR-mutant cell frequency of the homozygous carriers of a deletion at the GSTM1 locus was (4.63 +\/- 0.18) x 10(-4) while it was (4.05 +\/- 0.15) x 10(-4) in other groups of persons. The greatest mutant cell frequency was observed in carriers of the minor allele 4889G of the locus CYP1A. More often the increased values of the TCR-mutant cells (outside range \"3sigma\") were determined in women with genotypes A\/G or G\/G of the locus CYP1A1 (25%) than in carries of the normal genotype A\/A (1.6%) (OR = 20.6; p = 0.0002). The comparison of the groups of women with reproductive system diseases reveals significant elevation in the mean TCR-mutant cell frequency in inhabitants of the most radiation polluted region among others.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9143cf058f61000cdd7","authors":["Zamulaeva IA","Sal'nikova LE","Ivanova TI","Orlova NV","Smirnova SG","Lapteva NSh","Chumachenko
