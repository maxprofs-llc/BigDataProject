Little is known about subjective sleep quality during NIV. The aims of this study were to evaluate subjective sleep quality of stable neuromuscular patients under long-term NIV by using Pittsburgh questionnaire (PSQI), and to assess its possible determinants.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f610003550","authors":["Grazia Crescimanno","Angela Misuraca","Giuseppina Purrazzella","Francesca Greco","Oreste Marrone"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.sleep.2014.06.010","first_seen_on":"2014-08-31T16:31:41+00:00","issns":["1878-5506"],"journal":"Sleep Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1409502681,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25172116?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25172116","pubdate":"2014-07-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"Subjective sleep quality in stable neuromuscular patients under non-invasive ventilation.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/subjective-sleep-quality-stable-neuromuscular-patients-under-noninvasive-ventilation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":3052874,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":937814,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115839,"mean":7.9842169754314,"rank":74141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":29601,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115839,"percentile":25},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1202,"mean":3.8402098251457,"rank":788,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":171,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1202,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":3.6992592592593,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Social Sciences":1,"Computer Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"EG":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/aghoury79\/status\/506117044505284610","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2642234],"posted_on":"2014-08-31T16:31:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Ahmed Elaghoury","url":"http:\/\/eg.linkedin.com\/in\/aghoury","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/749706574990573568\/1hdbWkTG_normal.jpg","description":"Physician specialized & blogging in psychiatry, sleep medicine & related neurology.","id_on_source":"aghoury79","tweeter_id":"55548061","geo":{"lt":31.21564,"ln":29.95527,"country":"EG"},"followers":2030},"tweet_id":"506117044505284610"}]}}
