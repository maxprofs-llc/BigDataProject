The up-dated 2008 International Workshop on CLL (IWCLL) guidelines recommend using the B-cell count as a basis for the diagnosis of CLL and indicate a B-cell threshold of 5.0 \u00d7 10(9)\/l. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of these changes on the pattern of presentation and clinical outcome of early CLL.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073d2","authors":["Stefano Molica","Diana Giannarelli","Rosanna Mirabelli","Luciano Levato","Massimo Gentile","Mirella Lentini","Fortunato Morabito"],"doi":"10.1586\/17474086.2014.954542","endpage":"5","first_seen_on":"2014-09-02T10:31:36+00:00","issns":["1747-4086","1747-4094"],"journal":"Expert Review of Hematology","last_mentioned_on":1409628480,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1586\/17474086.2014.954542"],"pmid":"25174547","pubdate":"2014-08-31T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"1","subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Changes in the incidence, pattern of presentation and clinical outcome of early chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients using the 2008 International Workshop on CLL guidelines.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/changes-incidence-pattern-presentation-clinical-outcome-early-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia-patients-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":4198392,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132650,"mean":8.4749417334472,"rank":106628,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132650,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":200,"mean":1.4973668341709,"rank":168,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":200,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.1380952380952,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
