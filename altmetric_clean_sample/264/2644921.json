As currently defined the genus includes four species: T. deprinsorum sp. n. from the Democratic Republic of Congo; T. albolineana sp. n. (type species) from the Democratic Republic of Congo; T. spinai (Razowski & Trematerra), comb. n., from Ethiopia and Nigeria; and T. limbata (Diakonoff), comb. n., from the Seychelles and Kenya. Thaumatovalva limbata has been reared from the fruit of Cordia somaliensis Baker and C. monoica Roxb. (Boraginaceae) in Kenya. Although structures of the male and female genitalia are extremely similar among three of the four species, male secondary scales on the under surface of the hindwing easily distinguish them.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53d3cf058f610004744","authors":["Alicia Timm","Alicia Timm","John Brown"],"doi":"10.3897\/zookeys.438.7490","first_seen_on":"2014-09-01T22:45:12+00:00","issns":["1313-2970"],"issue":"438","journal":"ZooKeys","last_mentioned_on":1412246286,"links":["http:\/\/www.pensoft.net\/journals\/zookeys\/article\/7490\/abstract\/a-new-genus-of-grapholitini-from-africa-related-to-thaumatotibia-lepidoptera-tortricidae-","http:\/\/www.pensoft.net\/journals\/zookeys\/article\/7490\/a-new-genus-of-grapholitini-from-africa-related-to-thaumatotibia-lepidoptera-tortricidae-#.VBbCBfDIsOs.twitter","http:\/\/zookeys.pensoft.net\/articles.php?id=4024","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3897\/zookeys.438.7490"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pensoft.net\/inc\/journals\/download.php?fileTable=J_GALLEYS&fileId=9071","pmcid":"PMC4155726","pmid":"25197220","pubdate":"2014-01-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Pensoft Publishers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"A new genus of Grapholitini from Africa related to Thaumatotibia (Lepidoptera, Tortricidae)","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-genus-grapholitini-africa-related-thaumatotibia-lepidoptera-tortricidae"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.55,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5028713,"mean":5.9653160399705,"rank":670691,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":4356353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5028713,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133018,"mean":8.4161055053117,"rank":21663,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":111295,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133018,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1795,"mean":12.925544035674,"rank":480,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":1314,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1795,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":14.786095238095,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"JP":1,"ZA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ZooKeys_Journal\/status\/506459789107662850","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2644921],"posted_on":"2014-09-01T15:13:17+00:00","author":{"name":"ZooKeys","url":"http:\/\/zookeys.pensoft.net","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1154517305\/zookeys_logo_normal.jpg","description":"The next generation open access peer-reviewed journal in systematic zoology.
