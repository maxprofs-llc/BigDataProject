In the presence of an antifungal inhibitor, a subset of these mutants exhibits a growth phenotype of hypersensitivity or hyposensitivity. Collectively these mutants reflect aspects of the mechanism of action of the compound in question. In the course of screening natural products a culture of Streptomyces sp. MS-1-4 was discovered to produce a compound, dretamycin, which yielded a fitness profile exhibiting significant hypersensitivity of the DRE2 heterozygote and hyposensitivity of the DIP5 heterozygote. Herein we report the production, isolation, and structure elucidation of dretamycin.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d8b","authors":["Wilson KE","Smith SK","Kelly R","Masurekar P","Xu D","Parish CA","Wang H","Zink DL","Davies JE","Roemer T"],"doi":"10.1021\/np401019t","first_seen_on":"2014-08-30T17:37:50+00:00","issns":["0163-3864"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Natural Products","last_mentioned_on":1409420260,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24933689?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24933689","pubdate":"2014-06-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Discovery, Isolation, and Structure Elucidation of Dretamycin.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/discovery-isolation-structure-elucidation-dretamycin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4195183,"mean":5.1246661050718,"rank":3349166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":115309,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4195183,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108924,"mean":8.1621862967418,"rank":86886,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":524,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108924,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1071,"mean":3.0343271028037,"rank":837,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1071,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":2.3738095238095,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
