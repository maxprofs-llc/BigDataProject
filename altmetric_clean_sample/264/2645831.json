Nevertheless not all patients with the above pathologies will develop symptomatic foraminal stenosis. We hypothesised that symptomatic patients have anatomical predisposition to foraminal stenosis, namely a larger pedicle height (PH) to vertebral body height (VH) ratio, leaving less room below the pedicle for the exiting nerve root compared to asymptomatic patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002870","authors":["Merckaert S","Pierzchala K","Kulik G","Schizas C"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00586-014-3524-3","first_seen_on":"2014-09-02T09:20:15+00:00","issns":["0940-6719"],"issue":"","journal":"European Spine Journal","last_mentioned_on":1409621242,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25169143?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25169143","pubdate":"2014-08-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgical Orthopedics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Influence of anatomical variations on lumbar foraminal stenosis pathogenesis.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-anatomical-variations-lumbar-foraminal-stenosis-pathogenesis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":3052047,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":937135,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116099,"mean":8.0674163379216,"rank":74128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":29530,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116099,"percentile":25},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1572,"mean":2.04739401655,"rank":573,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":796,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1572,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110,"mean":0.79816513761468,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":81,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
