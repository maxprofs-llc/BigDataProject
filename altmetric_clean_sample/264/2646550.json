To overcome this limitation, the use of short acting benzodiazepines by cardiologists spread widely, causing concerns about the safety of this procedure in the absence of anesthesiology assistance. The aim of the study was to compare feasibility of a cardiologist-only approach with an anesthesiologist-assisted sedation protocol during elective direct-current cardioversion (DCC) of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b29","authors":["Federico Guerra","Ilaria Pavoni","Andrea Romandini","Luca Baldetti","Maria Vittoria Matassini","Michela Brambatti","Mario Luzi","Giuseppe Pupita","Alessandro Capucci"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijcard.2014.08.050","first_seen_on":"2014-09-02T13:17:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1874-1754"],"journal":"International Journal of Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1409655900,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25176628","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25176628?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25176628","pubdate":"2014-08-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Feasibility of a cardiologist-only approach to sedation for electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation: A randomized, open-blinded, prospective study.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/feasibility-cardiologistonly-approach-sedation-electrical-cardioversion-atrial-fibrillation-randomiz"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036026,"mean":5.9656490211997,"rank":3343067,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1485712,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036026,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132903,"mean":8.4531074927394,"rank":83652,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":43409,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132903,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2412,"mean":2.4308170883451,"rank":1043,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":1255,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2412,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82,"mean":0.96950617283951,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
