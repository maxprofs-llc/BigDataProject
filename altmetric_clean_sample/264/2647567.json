In vertebrates, the expression of sal-like 4 (SALL4) is specifically enriched in both embryonic and adult stem\/stem-like cells. SALL4 is a master regulator that contributes to cell stemness in biological development and tumor growth. Thus, Sall4 has emerged as a target for gene therapy. In addition, numerous mutations affecting the Sall4 gene have been discovered and clinically linked to a series of congenital abnormalities, such as Duane\/Duane-related syndromes, ventricular septal defect and premature ovarian failure. This review delineates the underlying mechanisms of key functions of SALL4 and its use as a target for gene therapy. Finally, I summarize and discuss advances made on the application of Sall4 and its functions in diagnostics and treatments for human diseases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000266f","authors":["Jianhua Xiong"],"first_seen_on":"2014-09-02T16:24:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1875-5631"],"journal":"Current Gene Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1409656110,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25174577?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25174577","pubdate":"2014-08-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"SALL4: Engine of Cell Stemness.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sall4-sall4-engine-cell-stemness"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4208036,"mean":5.1272672845211,"rank":3360173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":115576,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4208036,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109927,"mean":8.222134344923,"rank":87719,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":518,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109927,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":1.7115365853659,"rank":54,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.7,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
