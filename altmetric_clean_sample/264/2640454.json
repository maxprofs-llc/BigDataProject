A commercially available rock climbing structure with ample features for submaximal effort climbing provided continuous terrain. Participants were instructed to climb at a comfortable pace. Following an initial 5-min rest, each child climbed one sustained 5-min bout followed by 5-min sitting recovery for a total of 10 min (SUS). This was immediately followed by five 1-min climbing + 1-min recovery intervals for a second total of 10 min (INT). Expired air was analyzed continuously. Energy expenditure (EE) was determined via the Weir method for 10-s intervals throughout the full protocol. The total energy expenditure in kilocalories during the 10-min SUS period was 34.3 \u00b1 11.3 kcal. Energy expenditure during the 10-min INT period averaged 39.3 \u00b1 13.1 kcal and was significantly higher than during SUS (p < .05). The mean total EE for SUS + INT was 73.7 \u00b1 24.2 kcal. EE was correlated with body mass; r = .86. The rock climbing tasks employed in this study produced EE levels similar to what have been reported in children for stair climbing, sports\/games activities, and easy jogging.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ec3cf058f610005d78","authors":["Watts PB","Ostrowski ML"],"doi":"10.1123\/pes.2013-0035","first_seen_on":"2014-08-30T15:28:20+00:00","issns":["0899-8493"],"issue":"1","journal":"Pediatric Exercise Science","last_mentioned_on":1409408483,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24662119"],"pmid":"24662119","pubdate":"2014-03-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["sportsmedicine","pediatrics"],"title":"Oxygen uptake and energy expenditure for children during rock climbing activity.","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/oxygen-uptake-energy-expenditure-children-during-rock-climbing-activity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4195183,"mean":5.1246661050718,"rank":350585,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":3828540,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4195183,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108924,"mean":8.1590503933972,"rank":13250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":95286,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108924,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94,"mean":3.3672043010753,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":87,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":3.22,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
