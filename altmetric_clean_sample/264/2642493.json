As shown here, such variations strongly affect copper ion's coordination geometry, redox behavior, and oxidative reactivity. Copper(I) complexes bound to either \u03b4-HGH or \u03b5-HGH tripeptides were synthesized and characterized. Structural investigations using X-ray absorption spectroscopy, density functional theory calculations, and solution conductivity measurements reveal that \u03b4-HGH forms the Cu(I) dimer complex [{Cu(I)(\u03b4-HGH)}2](2+) (1) while \u03b5-HGH binds Cu(I) to give the monomeric complex [Cu(I)(\u03b5-HGH)](+) (2). Only 2 exhibits any reactivity, forming a strong CO adduct, [Cu(I)(\u03b5-HGH)(CO)](+), with properties closely matching those of the copper monooxygenase PHM. Also, 2 is reactive toward O2 or H2O2, giving a new type of O2-adduct or Cu(II)-OOH complex, respectively.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Ga Young Park","Jung Yoon Lee","Richard A.
