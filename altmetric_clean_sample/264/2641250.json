The synthesis featured a cyclopropanation\/ring opening strategy for establishing the stereogenic centers at C8 and C9, a biomimetic 2-pyrone Diels-Alder cycloaddition for the synthesis of the ABD ring system, and finally a highly efficient biomimetic intramolecular O-acylation for the C ring formation. This result provides an important perspective on the biosynthetic origin of the unprecedented 7-membered acyl ketene acetal moiety of the C ring.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","doi":"10.1002\/anie.201405770","first_seen_on":"2014-08-31T02:13:38+00:00","issns":["1521-3773"],"journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
