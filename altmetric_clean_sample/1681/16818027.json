The system is found to be ergodic. The distribution is used to compute macroscopic flow parameters. In particular, we find an expression for the overall mobility of the system from the ensemble distribution. The entropy production at the scale of the porous medium is shown to give the expected product of the average flow and its driving force, obtained from a black-box description. We test numerically some of the central theoretical results.","authors":["Isha Savani","Dick Bedeaux","Signe Kjelstrup","Morten Vassvik","Santanu Sinha","Alex Hansen"],"doi":"10.1103\/physreve.95.023116","first_seen_on":"2017-02-27T17:16:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2470-0053"],"issue":"2","journal":"Physical Review E","last_mentioned_on":1488215777,"links":["http:\/\/journals.aps.org\/pre\/abstract\/10.1103\/PhysRevE.95.023116"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.aps.org\/pdf\/10.1103\/PhysRevE.95.023116","pmid":"28297862","pubdate":"2017-02-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Physical Society","title":"Ensemble distribution for immiscible two-phase flow in porous media","type":"article","volume":"95","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ensemble-distribution-immiscible-twophase-flow-porous-media"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
