Their analyses, based on scientific data about the current epidemiologic trends of helminthiases and allergy in Bangladesh, also supports the idea that the main clinical effect of the IgE responses to Ascaris infection on allergy is increasing respiratory symptoms [2]. Clinically relevant parasite-induced immunosuppression in humans might be limited to heavy load, chronic infections. This article is protected by copyright.
