Surgery for spinal reconstruction is desirable, but may be difficult in a case with severe deformity. Here, we show the utility of a 3D NaCl (salt) model in preoperative planning of anterior reconstruction using a rib strut in a 49-year-old male patient with cervicothoracic degenerative spondylosis. We performed surgery in two stages: a posterior approach with decompression and posterior instrumentation with a pedicle screw; followed by a second operation using an anterior approach, for which we created a 3D NaCl model including the cervicothoracic lesion, spinal deformity, and ribs for anterior reconstruction. The 3D NaCl model was easily scraped compared with a conventional plaster model and was useful for planning of resection and identification of a suitable rib for grafting in a preoperative simulation. Surgery was performed successfully with reference to the 3D NaCl model. We conclude that preoperative simulation with a 3D NaCl model contributes to performance of anterior reconstruction using a rib strut in a case of cervicothoracic deformity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa92c3cf058f61000de35","authors":["Kobayashi, Kazuyoshi","Imagama, Shiro","Muramoto, Akio","Ito, Zenya","Ando, Kei","Yagi, Hideki","Hida, Tetsuro","Ito, Kenyu","Ishikawa, Yoshimoto","Tsushima, Mikito","Ishiguro, Naoki"],"first_seen_on":"2015-11-21T19:07:38+00:00","issns":["0027-7622"],"issue":"3","journal":"Nagoya journal of medical science","last_mentioned_on":1448151694,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26412901?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26412901","pubdate":"2015-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Utility of a 3-dimensional full-scale NaCl model for rib strut grafting for anterior fusion for cervicothoracic kyphosis.","type":"article","volume":"77","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/utility-3dimensional-fullscale-nacl-model-rib-strut-grafting-anterior-fusion-cervicothoracic-kyphosi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6593220,"mean":6.1186456839977,"rank":2729096,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3714451,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6593220,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248371,"mean":9.2870891170432,"rank":107999,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":132602,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248371,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":0.86756756756757,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.33333333333333,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Immunology and Microbiology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"DE":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/streamofphi\/statuses\/668073739158859776","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4791852],"posted_on":"2015-11-21T14:29:26+00:00","author":{"name":"soPHI","url":"http:\/\/sanatou.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1668313442\/icon_phi_normal.png","id_on_source":"streamofphi","tweeter_id":"426045794","geo":{"lt":52.5,"ln":13.41667,"country":"DE"},"followers":73},"tweet_id":"668073739158859776"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ceasebackpain\/statuses\/668073732758310912","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4791852],"posted_on":"2015-11-21T14:29:24+00:00","author":{"name":"Bob Boulder","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1266020523\/index_normal.jpg","description":"Back pain relief","id_on_source":"ceasebackpain","tweeter_id":"262792386","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":116},"tweet_id":"668073732758310912"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/stopbackache\/statuses\/668073737925750784","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4791852],"posted_on":"2015-11-21T14:29:25+00:00","author":{"name":"alan adames","url":"http:\/\/amzn.to\/gJyDrL","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1270864875\/index_normal.jpg","description":"ease your back pain \/ back ache","id_on_source":"stopbackache","tweeter_id":"264884493","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":14},"tweet_id":"668073737925750784"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psychoneurobiol\/statuses\/668222754173403136","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4791852],"posted_on":"2015-11-22T00:21:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr Alex Concorde","url":"http:\/\/www.concorde-mind-body-medicine.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1310324538\/Stress_even_closer_normal.jpg","description":"Individual Neurobiophysiology, Psychoneuroimmunology\/PNI, Psychoneuroendocrinology\/PNE, Subjectivity\/Stress\/Biology, Mind-Body Medicine, Limbic\/Hypothalamus\/ANS","id_on_source":"psychoneurobiol","tweeter_id":"118871383","geo":{"lt":54.75844,"ln":-2.69531,"country":"GB"},"followers":1087},"tweet_id":"668222754173403136"}]}}
