The diameter and calcification of the common femoral artery (CFA) and the thickness of the subcutaneous fat layer in the groin were assessed on computed tomography images.\nThe incidences of PCD failure and minor and major vascular complications were 19.5\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a016\/82), 19.5\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a016\/82), and 7\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a06\/82) respectively. 8.5\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a07\/82) had a minor perioperative bleeding, 6\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a05\/82) had a major bleeding, and none had any life-threatening bleeding. When PCD failed, haemostasis was obtained with fascia suturing, covered stent placement, or with surgical cutdown. Thirty-day mortality and 1-year all-cause mortality were 8.5\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a07\/82) and 19.5\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a016\/82), respectively. In a multiple regression analysis, the CFA diameter and the presence of severe calcification were independently related to PCD failure (correlation coefficient\u00a0=\u00a0-0.24, p\u00a0=\u00a00.027 and correlation coefficient\u00a0=\u00a00.23, p\u00a0=\u00a00.036, respectively).\nPCD failure was related to a small CFA diameter and to a severely calcified CFA. Failure could largely be managed with minimally invasive techniques such as covered stents or fascia suturing.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006de9","authors":["Charlotte Ebeling Barbier","Elin Lundin","Vilyam Melki","Stefan James","Rickard Nyman"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00270-015-1117-0","first_seen_on":"2015-11-21T06:31:17+00:00","issns":["1432-086X"],"journal":"CardioVascular and Interventional Radiology","last_mentioned_on":1448087452,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00270-015-1117-0"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00270-015-1117-0.pdf","pmid":"25968476","pubdate":"2015-05-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Imaging \/ Radiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nuclear Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ultrasound","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["radiology","cardiology"],"title":"Percutaneous Closure in Transfemoral Aortic Valve Implantation: A Single-Centre Experience","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/percutaneous-closure-transfemoral-aortic-valve-implantation-singlecentre-experience-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6589635,"mean":6.1154988547167,"rank":3134751,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1967360,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6589635,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248236,"mean":9.2875622373961,"rank":130132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":91741,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248236,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":389,"mean":1.9613402061856,"rank":147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":166,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":389,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":13.982142857143,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":2},"by_discipline":{"Materials Science":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IN":1},"mendeley":{"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/InCardiology\/statuses\/667953303490179072","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4790492],"posted_on":"2015-11-21T06:30:52+00:00","author":{"name":"India Cardiology 2.0","url":"http:\/\/cardiology.hcsm.in","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/888392364\/j0402858_normal.jpg","description":"Top News and Links For The Indian Cardiologist","id_on_source":"InCardiology","tweeter_id":"142214712","geo":{"lt":20,"ln":77,"country":"IN"},"followers":2499},"tweet_id":"667953303490179072"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CardioResearch\/statuses\/667953304853319680","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4790492],"posted_on":"2015-11-21T06:30:52+00:00","author":{"name":"cardio-research.com","url":"http:\/\/www.cardio-research.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1687818832\/with_website_normal.jpg","description":"http:\/\/t.co\/6HkOR9DFvf is an independent website with an aim to promote Basic Cardiovascular Research.","id_on_source":"CardioResearch","tweeter_id":"236133741","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":5878},"tweet_id":"667953304853319680"}]}}
