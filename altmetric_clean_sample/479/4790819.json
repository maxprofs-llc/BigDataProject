Thus, in this study we aimed to examine the association between an enduring change in mental health following the cessation period and future risk of relapse.\nA secondary analysis of prospective data pooled from five placebo-controlled randomised trials for smoking reduction conducted in Europe, USA and Australia. Change in mental health (SF-36, scored 0-100) was measured from baseline to four months for those who were biologically-validated as point-prevalence abstainers at four month follow-up. Thereafter we assessed whether relapse to smoking by 12\u00a0months was more likely in those whose mental health had worsened between baseline and four months compared with those who saw no change or an improvement.\nAfter adjustment for baseline mental health and other major covariates, there was no greater tendency to relapse at 12\u00a0months for those whose mental health worsened after cessation compared with those who had no change or an improvement. The odds ratio and 95\u00a0% confidence interval was 1.01 (0.97 to 1.05).\nPeople whose mental health worsens after smoking cessation are at no greater risk of subsequent relapse to smoking than those whose mental health stays the same or improves.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d8","authors":["Gemma Taylor","Ann McNeill","Paul Aveyard"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12889-015-2473-z","first_seen_on":"2015-11-21T09:46:02+00:00","funders":["niehs","mrc","bhf","cruk"],"issns":["1471-2458"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1466503818,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/15\/1150","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/15\/1150\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26589146?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/15\/1150?utm_content=buffer9b692&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4654809\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/s12889-015-2473-z.pdf","pmid":"26589146","pubdate":"2015-11-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biostatistics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Epidemiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Vaccine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1150","subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Does deterioration in mental health after smoking cessation predict relapse to smoking?","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/deterioration-mental-health-after-smoking-cessation-predict-relapse-smoking"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.05,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7926939,"mean":6.7044594278339,"rank":871026,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7054583,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7926939,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":291483,"mean":8.8925185911992,"rank":42911,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":248496,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":291483,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6838,"mean":8.7344341085272,"rank":1193,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":5643,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6838,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240,"mean":8.3435230125523,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":195,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":10,"researcher":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":10,"Scientists":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
