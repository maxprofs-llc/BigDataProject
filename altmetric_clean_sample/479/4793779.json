This illness is responsible for one hundred thousand human deaths per year worldwide, affecting mainly underdeveloped countries. Throughout its entire life cycle and invasion of human tissues, the parasite is constantly subjected to stress conditions. Under in vitro culture, this microaerophilic parasite can tolerate up to 5\u00a0% oxygen concentrations; however, during tissue invasion the parasite has to cope with the higher oxygen content found in well-perfused tissues (4-14\u00a0%) and with reactive oxygen and nitrogen species derived from both host and parasite. In this work, the role of the amoebic oxygen reduction pathway (ORP) and heat shock response (HSP) are analyzed in relation to E. histolytica pathogenicity. The data suggest that in contrast with non-pathogenic E. dispar, the higher level of ORP and HSPs displayed by E. histolytica enables its survival in tissues by diminishing and detoxifying intracellular oxidants and repairing damaged proteins to allow metabolic fluxes, replication and immune evasion.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002670","authors":["Olivos-Garc\u00eda, Alfonso","Saavedra, Emma","Nequiz, Mario","Santos, Fabiola","Luis-Garc\u00eda, Erika Rub\u00ed","Gudi\u00f1o, Marco","P\u00e9rez-Tamayo, Ruy"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00294-015-0543-5","first_seen_on":"2015-11-22T13:45:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-0983"],"journal":"Current Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1448199913,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26589893?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26589893","pubdate":"2015-11-22T22:00:17+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Proteomics","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"The oxygen reduction pathway and heat shock stress response are both required for Entamoeba histolytica pathogenicity.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/oxygen-reduction-pathway-heat-shock-stress-response-both-required-entamoeba-histolytica-pathogenicit"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6593220,"mean":6.1186456839977,"rank":5625013,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6593220,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248547,"mean":9.2839810175984,"rank":196654,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248547,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244,"mean":1.7236378600823,"rank":182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.35,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
