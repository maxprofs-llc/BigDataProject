However, a significant proportion of patients does not respond to anti-TNF agents or lose response over time. Recently, therapeutic drug monitoring has gained a major role in identifying the mechanism and management of loss of response. The aim of this review article is to summarize the predictors of efficacy and outcomes, the different mechanisms of anti-TNF\/biological failure in Crohn's disease and identify strategies to optimize biological treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073d1","authors":["Krisztina Barbara Gecse"],"doi":"10.1586\/17474124.2016.1096198","first_seen_on":"2015-11-24T00:08:42+00:00","issns":["1747-4132"],"journal":"Expert Review of Gastroenterology and Hepatology","last_mentioned_on":1448324087,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1586\/17474124.2016.1096198?ai=1lbbq&mi=ianpxd&af=R"],"pmid":"26471077","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Optimizing biological therapy in Crohn\u2019s disease","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/optimizing-biological-therapy-crohns-disease-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6602221,"mean":6.1274999121509,"rank":4884894,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":969233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6602221,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249612,"mean":9.2555301649366,"rank":169711,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":52007,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249612,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":394,"mean":1.5033180661578,"rank":186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":156,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":394,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":1.2053571428571,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ERJournals\/statuses\/668944213413769217","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4798877],"posted_on":"2015-11-24T00:08:23+00:00","author":{"name":"Expert Reviews","url":"http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/page\/ExpertReviews","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000496751182\/2258702d67dd42cedd317fb79fc5212a_normal.jpeg","description":"Expert Reviews is a leading series of 16 journals providing commentary and analysis on modern healthcare","id_on_source":"ERJournals","tweeter_id":"1886949961","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1286},"tweet_id":"668944213413769217"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cristinatejerap\/statuses\/668945824785788928","license":"gnip","rt":["ERJournals"],"citation_ids":[4798877],"posted_on":"2015-11-24T00:14:47+00:00","author":{"name":"Cristina Tejera","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/796767188325695489\/_wc42Rou_normal.jpg","description":"M\u00e9dico Esp Endocrinologia y Nutrici\u00f3n.
