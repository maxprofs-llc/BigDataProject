Magnetic resonance angiography revealed occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery. Many neurocutaneous syndromes have been linked to ischemic stroke syndromes. Incontinentia pigmenti has not been associated with stroke syndromes in the past; however, this report illustrates that the patient and her mother, who also has incontinentia pigmenti, may have had similar ischemic stroke events.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032b1","authors":["Pellegrino, R J","Shah, A J"],"doi":"10.1016\/0887-8994(94)90073-6","first_seen_on":"2015-11-21T19:59:27+00:00","issns":["0887-8994"],"issue":"1","journal":"Pediatric Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1448130075,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/0887-8994(94)90073-6"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pedneur.com\/article\/0887899494900736\/pdf","pmid":"8198677","pubdate":"1994-01-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology","pediatrics"],"title":"Vascular occlusion associated with incontinentia pigmenti","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vascular-occlusion-associated-incontinentia-pigmenti"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6589643,"mean":6.1155965899212,"rank":881826,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":5652695,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6589643,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248236,"mean":9.2875781497372,"rank":45412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":200093,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248236,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1018,"mean":2.3696873156342,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":965,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1018,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":1.6061363636364,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Common Neurocutaneous Syndromes","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=23470307117&p=1pl&v=1&x=XOaOMoaR3ubstGToAtvCEA","license":"public","citation_ids":[4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792318,4792319,3866840,3300664,4792320,4792321,4792322,4792323,1954141,1486159,518102,4792324,2265695,1775292,1534726,2460557,4792325,4792326,4792327,4792328,4792329,4792330,4792331,4792332,4792333],"posted_on":"2015-11-21T18:21:15+00:00","summary":"Neurocutaneous syndromes are a diverse group of neurologic disorders with concurrent skin manifestations.","author":{"name":"Healio.com","url":"http:\/\/www.healio.com","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/000\/968\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2015-04-10_at_13.36.33.png?1428669420"}}]}}
