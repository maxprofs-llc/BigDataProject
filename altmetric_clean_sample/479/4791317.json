Further studies exemplified that EPS and the organic carbon secreted by the isolates controlled the dissemination of the calcareous crystals precipitated. From the study, it is evident that an EPS concentration of 7-15\u00a0mg\u00a0l(-1) was found to enhance the dissemination of the calcareous crystals. Atomic force micrographs explain the nucleation behaviour and morphology of the calcareous crystals precipitated. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX) showed that the crystals were mainly composed of calcite and partially wollastonite.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a88","authors":["Sarayu, K","Iyer, Nagesh R","Annaselvi, M","Ramachandra Murthy, A"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12010-015-1929-z","first_seen_on":"2015-11-21T11:21:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1559-0291"],"journal":"Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1448104863,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26585115?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26585115","pubdate":"2015-11-21T22:01:21+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemistry","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology","biochemistry"],"title":"The Micro-mechanism Involved and Wollastonite Signature in the Calcareous Precipitates of Marine Isolates.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/micromechanism-involved-wollastonite-signature-calcareous-precipitates-marine-isolates"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6589635,"mean":6.1154988547167,"rank":5621791,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6589635,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248235,"mean":9.2876016661699,"rank":196356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248235,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":665,"mean":1.2905692771084,"rank":361,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":665,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":0.48076923076923,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
