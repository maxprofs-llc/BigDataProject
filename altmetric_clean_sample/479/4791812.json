Xenograft models of ovarian cancer were used to determine if co-injection with pericytes affected tumour growth rate and metastasis; while co-culture models were utilized to investigate the direct effect of pericytes on ovarian cancer cells. Pericyte markers were used to stain patient tissue samples to ascertain their use in prognosis.\nInterrogation of two serous ovarian cancer patient datasets (the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study, n = 215; and the NCI TCGA, n=408), show that a high pericyte score is highly predictive for poor patient prognosis. Co-injection of ovarian cancer (OVCAR-5 & -8) cells with pericytes in a xenograft model, resulted in accelerated ovarian tumour growth, and aggressive metastases, without altering tumour vasculature. Pericyte co-culture in vitro promoted ovarian cancer cell proliferation and invasion. High SMA protein levels in patient tissue microarrays were correlated with more aggressive disease and earlier recurrence.\nHigh pericyte score provides the best means to date of identifying ovarian cancer patients at high risk of rapid relapse and mortality (mean PFS <9 months). The stroma contains rare yet extremely potent locally-resident mesenchymal stem cells - a subset of \"cancer-associated fibroblasts\" that promote aggressive tumour growth and metastatic dissemination, underlying the prognostic capacity of a high pericyte score to strongly predict earlier relapse and mortality.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006efa","authors":["Devbarna Sinha","Lynn Chong","Joshy George","Holger Schlueter","Susann Monchgesang","Stuart Mills","Li Jason","Christopher R.
