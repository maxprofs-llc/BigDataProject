This study examined relationship between patency and mRNA levels for inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-1, COX-2 and prostaglandin E synthase (PGES) in the uterine cervix of bitches with pyometra. Cervical patency was measured by inserting the stainless steel rods with different diameter into cervical canals. Levels of mRNA expression were determined by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The cervical patency was positively correlated with mRNA levels for COX-2 and PGES, but not those for iNOS and COX-1. The results suggest that gene expression of COX-2 and PGES may be involved in the regulation of patency in the uterine cervix of bitches with pyometra.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f1f","authors":["Tamada, Hiromichi","Adachi, Nahoko","Kawate, Noritoshi","Inaba, Toshio","Hatoya, Shingo","Sawada, Tsutomu"],"doi":"10.1292\/jvms.15-0520","first_seen_on":"2015-11-23T12:07:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1347-7439"],"journal":"Journal of Veterinary Medical Science","last_mentioned_on":1448502657,"links":["https:\/\/www.jstage.jst.go.jp\/article\/jvms\/advpub\/0\/advpub_15-0520\/_article","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26596635?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.jstage.jst.go.jp\/A_PRedirectJournalInit?sryCd=jvms&noVol=advpub&noIssue=0&kijiCd=advpub_15-0520&screenID=AF06S010&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26596635","pubdate":"2015-11-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Positive correlation between patency and mRNA levels for cyclooxygenase-2 and prostaglandin E synthase in the uterine cervix of bitches with pyometra","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/positive-correlation-between-patency-mrna-levels-cyclooxygenase2-prostaglandin-e-synthase-uterine-ce"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6611727,"mean":6.131580845607,"rank":4648443,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1720368,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6611727,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249439,"mean":9.2486891251533,"rank":157504,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":79810,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249439,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1345,"mean":0.96538244047619,"rank":332,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":817,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1345,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175,"mean":0.75172413793103,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Albinovet\/statuses\/668762671047659520","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4796239],"posted_on":"2015-11-23T12:07:00+00:00","author":{"name":"Stefano Cattaneo DVM","url":"http:\/\/veterinarialbino.com\/\/twitter_en.html","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1673372763\/vet_tweet_normal.png","description":"Daily updates about pet health covering the last articles published in veterinary journals.","id_on_source":"Albinovet","tweeter_id":"418669767","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2106},"tweet_id":"668762671047659520"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jvms_japan\/statuses\/669576055489892352","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4796239],"posted_on":"2015-11-25T17:59:06+00:00","author":{"name":"jvms_japan","url":"http:\/\/jsvetsci.jp\/jvms\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1898235853\/twitter-icon_normal.gif","id_on_source":"jvms_japan","tweeter_id":"524151017","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":35},"tweet_id":"669576055489892352"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jvms_japan\/statuses\/669694800317124608","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4796239],"posted_on":"2015-11-26T01:50:57+00:00","author":{"name":"jvms_japan","url":"http:\/\/jsvetsci.jp\/jvms\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1898235853\/twitter-icon_normal.gif","id_on_source":"jvms_japan","tweeter_id":"524151017","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":35},"tweet_id":"669694800317124608"}]}}
