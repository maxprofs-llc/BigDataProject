Depending on the cell line, blebs play important roles in many different phenomena including mitosis and locomotion. The expansion phase of cellular blebbing has been mathematically modelled in detail. However, the active processes occurring during the retraction phase are not so well characterized. It is thought that blebs retract because a cortex reforms inside, and adheres to, the bleb membrane. This cortex is retracted into the cell and the attached bleb membrane follows. Using a computational model of a cell's membrane, cortex and interconnecting adhesions, we demonstrate that cortex retraction alone cannot account for bleb retraction and suggest that the mechanism works in tandem with membrane shrinking. Further, an emergent hysteresis loop is observed in the intracellular pressure, which suggests a potential mechanism through which a secondary bleb can be initiated as a primary bleb contracts.","altmetric_jid":"5668333c2a83ee0b398b4567","authors":["Woolley, Thomas E","Gaffney, Eamonn A","Goriely, Alain"],"doi":"10.1098\/rsos.150184","first_seen_on":"2015-11-21T11:24:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2054-5703"],"issue":"7","journal":"Royal Society Open Science","last_mentioned_on":1448105081,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26587278?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26587278","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Membrane shrinkage and cortex remodelling are predicted to work in harmony to retract blebs.","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/membrane-shrinkage-cortex-remodelling-predicted-work-harmony-retract-blebs"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6589635,"mean":6.1154988547167,"rank":5621791,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6589635,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248236,"mean":9.2875706971217,"rank":196356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248236,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":551,"mean":58.206981818182,"rank":524,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":551,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78,"mean":35.917558441558,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
