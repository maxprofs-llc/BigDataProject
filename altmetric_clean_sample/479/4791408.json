The recent recognition that these bullae can become infected, causing chronic unilateral nasal discharge, has stimulated interest in these structures. Fourteen cadaveric horse heads were transected sagittally midline and dissected to expose the nasal conchal bullae. The dimensions of each bulla, the number and orientation of drainage apertures, and cellulae septae were recorded. Randomly selected samples were examined histologically. The mean DCB and VCB lengths were 78\u2005 and 57\u2005mm, respectively; equivalent to 13.9 per cent and 10.2 per cent of skull length, respectively. The mean DCB and VCB heights were 29\u2005 and 28\u2005mm, respectively; equivalent to 5.2 per cent and 5 per cent of skull length, respectively. The DCB was larger than the VCB, containing more septae, cellulae and drainage apertures. No communications were identified between the bullae and the immediately adjacent paranasal sinuses. Histology revealed that the bullae consist of ciliated, pseudostratified, columnar epithelium over glandular submucosa often overlying turbinate bone and, variably, hyaline cartilage. This more detailed description of equine DCB and VCB anatomy will hopefully facilitate successful treatment of their disorders.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036fe","authors":["Froydenlund, T J","Dixon, P M","Smith, S H","Reardon, R J M","T.
