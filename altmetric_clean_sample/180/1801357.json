However, the reported frequency of the association is variable, partly depending upon the defining criteria used. Here we report two patients with thyrotoxicosis in whom gynaecomastia was the presenting feature. Both patients had other contributing factors, which are assumed to have predisposed to gynaecomastia. In both patients, the gynaecomastia resolved with successful treatment of the thyrotoxicosis. When gynaecomastia is a presenting, or prominent feature of thyrotoxicosis, the possibility of additional underlying pathology should be considered.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003370","authors":["W Chan","V Yeung","C Chow","W So","C Cockram","W B Chan","V T F Yeung","C C Chow","W Y So","C S Cockram","Chan, W B","Yeung, V T","Chow, C C","So, W Y","Cockram, C S"],"doi":"10.1136\/pgmj.75.882.229","first_seen_on":"2013-10-03T18:20:51+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["0032-5473","1469-0756"],"issue":"882","journal":"Postgraduate Medical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1501077840,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1741202\/pdf\/v075p00229.pdf","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10715765","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1741202","http:\/\/pmj.bmj.com\/content\/75\/882\/229.full","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10715765","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1741202"],"pdf_url":"\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1741202\/pdf\/v075p00229.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1741202","pmid":"10715765","pubdate":"1999-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"229","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Gynaecomastia as a presenting feature of thyrotoxicosis","type":"article","volume":"75","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gynaecomastia-presenting-feature-thyrotoxicosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.25,"score_history":{"1y":3.25,"6m":3.25,"3m":3.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8276988,"mean":6.9824426364262,"rank":1774024,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6490284,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8276988,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":141273,"mean":7.1767305906338,"rank":30765,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":110257,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":141273,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1503,"mean":7.9536830892144,"rank":408,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":1091,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1503,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":18.835714285714,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
