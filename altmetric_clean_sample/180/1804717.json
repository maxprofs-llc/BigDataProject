In order to gain insight into shared and distinct molecular and phenotypic networks linked to variations in 5-HT homeostasis, we capitalized on the stable genetic variation present in recombinant inbred mouse strains. This family of strains, all derived from crosses between C57BL\/6J and DBA\/2J (BXD) parents, represents a unique, community resource with approximately 40\u2009years of assembled phenotype data that can be exploited to explore and test causal relationships in silico. We determined levels of 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid from whole blood, midbrain and thalamus\/hypothalamus (diencephalon) of 38 BXD lines and both sexes. All 5-HT measures proved highly heritable in each region, although both gender and region significantly impacted between-strain correlations. Our studies identified both expected and novel biochemical, anatomical and behavioral phenotypes linked to 5-HT traits, as well as distinct quantitative trait loci. Analyses of these loci nominate a group of genes likely to contribute to gender- and region-specific capacities for 5-HT signaling. Analysis of midbrain mRNA variations across strains revealed overlapping gene expression networks linked to 5-HT synthesis and metabolism. Altogether, our studies provide a rich profile of genomic, molecular and phenotypic networks that can be queried for novel relationships contributing risk for disorders linked to perturbed 5-HT signaling.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f61000293f","authors":["Ye, R.","Carneiro, A.
