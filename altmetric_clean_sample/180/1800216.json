The anion of this salt, [O2C-P(CO)2P](2-), is built up by a four-membered 1,3-diphosphetane-2,4-dione ring and a carboxylate unit attached to one of the phosphorus atoms. A remarkable \u03c0-delocalization was observed within the OCPCO moiety. The stepwise reaction mechanism leading to Na2(P2C3O4) was investigated with quantum chemical calculations. Accompanied by the release of CO2, Na2(P2C3O4) reacts with both 2-iodopropane and 4,4',4''-trimethoxytriphenylmethyl chloride to form four-membered cyclic anions. For comparison the analogous reactions were performed with Na(OCP) instead of Na2(P2C3O4) and the results are discussed in detail.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Dominikus Heift","Zoltan Benko","Hansj\u00c3\u00b6rg Friedrich Gr\u00c3\u00bctzmacher","Heift D","Benk\u0151 Z","Gr\u00fctzmacher H","Zolt\u00e1n Benk\u0151","Hansj\u00f6rg Gr\u00fctzmacher"],"doi":"10.1039\/c3dt52359d","endpage":"840","first_seen_on":"2013-10-03T09:50:28+00:00","issns":["1477-9234","1477-9226"],"issue":"2","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1386198605,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2013\/DT\/C3DT52359D","http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2013\/dt\/C3DT52359D","http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2014\/dt\/C3DT52359D"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2013\/dt\/c3dt52359d","pmid":"24153381","pubdate":"2013-10-23T23:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"831","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Coulomb repulsion versus cycloaddition: Formation of anionic four-membered rings from sodium phosphaethynolate, Na(OCP)","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/xlink.rsc.org\/?DOI=C3DT52359D","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/coulomb-repulsion-versus-cycloaddition-formation-anionic-fourmembered-rings-sodium-phosphaethynolate"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3562123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":137487,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99423,"mean":7.7513341916279,"rank":79200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":699,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99423,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7988,"mean":0.87506973832478,"rank":3914,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7988,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":2.675,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
