In General Medicine, there are scores to assist in making diagnoses and prognoses, scores to assist therapeutic decision making and to evaluate therapeutic results and scores to help physicians when informing and advising patients. We review six of the scoring systems that have the greatest utility for the General Physician in hospital-based care and in General Practice. The Nutritional Risk Screening (NRS 2002) tool is designed to identify hospital patients in danger of malnutrition. The aim is to improve the nutritional status of these patients. The CURB-65 score predicts 30-day mortality in patients with community acquired pneumonia. Patients with a low score can be considered for home treatment, patients with an elevated score require hospitalisation and those with a high score should be treated as having severe pneumonia; treatment in the intensive care unit should be considered. The IAS-AGLA score of the Working Group on Lipids and Atherosclerosis of the Swiss Society of Cardiology calculates the 10-year risk of a myocardial infarction for people living in Switzerland. The working group makes recommendations for preventative treatment according to the calculated risk status. The Body Mass Index, which is calculated by dividing the body weight in kilograms by the height in meters squared and then divided into weight categories, is used to classify people as underweight, of normal weight, overweight or obese. The prognostic value of this classification is discussed. The Mini-Mental State Examination allows the physician to assess important cognitive functions in a simple and standardised form. The Glasgow Coma Scale is used to classify the level of consciousness in patients with head injury. It can be used for triage and correlates with prognosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008b5f","authors":["Ursula Huber","Andreas R\u00f6sli","Peter E Ballmer","Sarah Jane Rippin","Huber, Ursula","R\u00f6sli, Andreas","Ballmer, Peter E","Rippin, Sarah Jane"],"doi":"10.1024\/0040-5930\/a000447","first_seen_on":"2013-10-05T10:02:35+00:00","issns":["0040-5930"],"issue":"10","journal":"Therapeutische Umschau","last_mentioned_on":1380967456,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24091334?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24091334","pubdate":"2013-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"[The use of scores in general medicine].","type":"article","volume":"70","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/scores-der-allgemeinen-inneren-medizin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628371,"mean":4.9417862081361,"rank":2903827,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75824,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628371,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93762,"mean":7.6657694350532,"rank":74422,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93762,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":1.1685957446809,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Computer Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/libroazuln\/status\/386431153416069120","license":"public","citation_ids":[1805193],"posted_on":"2013-10-05T10:02:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Libro Azul","url":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Libro-Azul\/279667772085894?sk=app_190322544333196","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1733482297\/Bright_512x512_normal.png","description":"La desnutrici\u00f3n es un factor que se asocia con mal pron\u00f3stico en pacientes hospitalizados y ambulatorios","id_on_source":"libroazuln","tweeter_id":"454601506","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":158},"tweet_id":"386431153416069120"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/libroazuln\/status\/386431638692827136","license":"public","citation_ids":[1805193],"posted_on":"2013-10-05T10:04:16+00:00","author":{"name":"Libro Azul","url":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Libro-Azul\/279667772085894?sk=app_190322544333196","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1733482297\/Bright_512x512_normal.png","description":"La desnutrici\u00f3n es un factor que se asocia con mal pron\u00f3stico en pacientes hospitalizados y ambulatorios","id_on_source":"libroazuln","tweeter_id":"454601506","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":158},"tweet_id":"386431638692827136"}]}}
