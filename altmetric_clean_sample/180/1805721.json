Selected pharmaceuticals included two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (diclofenac and mefenamic acid), an antibiotic (trimethoprim), an anti-epileptic (carbamazepine) and a lipid regulator (gemfibrozil). An in vivo exposure experiment was set up in the laboratory in which mussels were exposed either directly by injection (10 ng) or daily through spiked artificial seawater (ASW) over 96 h. In liquid matrices, pharmaceutical residues were either determined using liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS) directly, or in combination with solid-phase extraction (SPE) for analyte concentration purposes. The extraction of pharmaceuticals from mussel tissues used an additional pressurised liquid extraction step prior to SPE and LCMS\/MS. Limits of quantification of between 2 and 46 ng L\u22121 were achieved for extracted cooking water and ASW, between 2 and 64 \u03bcg L\u22121 for ASW in exposure tanks, and between 4 and 29 ng g\u22121 for mussel tissue. Method linearities were achieved for pharmaceuticals in each matrix with correlation coefficients of R2>0.975. A selection of exposed mussels was also cooked (via steaming) and analysed using the optimised method to observe any effect on detectable concentrations of parent pharmaceuticals present. An overall increase in pharmaceutical residues in the contaminated mussel tissue and cooking water was observed after cooking.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224a","authors":["Gillian McEneff","Leon Barron","Brian Kelleher","Brett Paull","Brian Quinn","McEneff G","Barron L","Kelleher B","Paull B","Quinn B"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00216-013-7371-6","endpage":"9521","first_seen_on":"2013-10-05T17:55:34+00:00","issns":["1618-2650","1618-2642"],"issue":"29","journal":"Analytical & Bioanalytical Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1389189366,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00216-013-7371-6","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00216-013-7371-6"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00216-013-7371-6.pdf","pmid":"24367803","pubdate":"2013-10-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Characterization and Evaluation of Materials","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Monitoring\/Analysis","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Food Science","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Laboratory Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"9509","subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"The determination of pharmaceutical residues in cooked and uncooked marine bivalves using pressurised liquid extraction, solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography\u00e2\u0080\u0093tandem mass spectrometry","type":"article","volume":"405","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/determination-pharmaceutical-residues-cooked-uncooked-marine-bivalves-using-pressurised-liquid-extra"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6229233,"mean":5.9658211095702,"rank":2549468,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3542983,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6229233,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110856,"mean":7.9420414415228,"rank":46059,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":61377,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110856,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1806,"mean":1.8487966759003,"rank":441,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":1313,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1806,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":1.1567307692308,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
