Short expansions of the polyalanine tract in the N-terminus of PABPN1 lead to oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD), which is an adult onset disease characterized by eyelid drooping, difficulty in swallowing, and weakness in the proximal limb muscles. Why alanine-expanded PABPN1 leads to muscle-specific pathology is unknown. Given the general function of PABPN1 in RNA metabolism, intrinsic characteristics of skeletal muscle may make this tissue susceptible to the effects of mutant PABPN1.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000899","authors":["Luciano H Apponi","Anita H Corbett","Grace K Pavlath"],"doi":"10.1186\/2044-5040-3-23","first_seen_on":"2013-10-03T19:22:35+00:00","funders":["niams"],"issns":["2044-5040"],"issue":"1","journal":"Skeletal Muscle","last_mentioned_on":1380884086,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/24083404\/","http:\/\/www.skeletalmusclejournal.com\/content\/3\/1\/23\/abstract #skeletalmuscle"],"pmid":"24083404","pubdate":"2013-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Control of mRNA stability contributes to low levels of nuclear poly(A) binding protein 1 (PABPN1) in skeletal muscle.","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/control-mrna-stability-contributes-low-levels-nuclear-polya-binding-protein-1-pabpn1-skeletal-muscle"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":2080531,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":2872527,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104746,"mean":7.8863354432195,"rank":37972,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":64906,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104746,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":137,"mean":5.7117794117647,"rank":94,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":137,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":3.9495,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
