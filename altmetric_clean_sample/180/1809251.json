Glutathione (as analyte in yeast samples) and N-acetylcysteine (as internal standard) were selected as model compounds. Several parameters affecting the separation efficiency (buffer pH, concentration, and separation voltage) and the derivatization yield (pH, reaction time and reagent concentration) were thoroughly investigated. Validation was carried out towards the determination of glutathione in commercially available yeast samples. The LOD was 1.5\u03bcmolL(-1) and the linearity was obeyed in the range of 25-200\u03bcmolL(-1). The accuracy in terms of recoveries ranged between 95.9% and 113.6%. The approach proved to be free from matrix effects, while the results were confirmed by a corroborative method based on liquid chromatography coupled to post-column derivatization.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cf6","authors":["Eirini-Chrysanthi Tsardaka","Constantinos K.
