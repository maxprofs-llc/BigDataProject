Caries adversely affects and progressively destroys the tissues of the tooth, including the dental pulp (nerve), leaving teeth unsightly, weakened and with impaired function. The treatment of lesions of dental caries, which are progressing through dentine and have caused the formation of a cavity, involves the provision of dental restorations (fillings).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9123cf058f61000cc8c","authors":["Fedorowicz Z","Nasser M","Wilson N"],"doi":"10.1002\/14651858.cd007517.pub2","first_seen_on":"2013-10-07T18:06:25+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1465-1858",""],"issue":"4","journal":"Cochrane database of systematic reviews","last_mentioned_on":1442382775,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/14651858.CD007517.pub2\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/14651858.CD007517.pub2\/pdf","pmid":"19821423","pubdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Adhesively bonded versus non\u00e2\u0080\u0090bonded amalgam restorations for dental caries","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adhesively-bonded-versus-nonbonded-amalgam-restorations-dental-caries"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6487669,"mean":5.9628643595813,"rank":949557,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":5535329,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6487669,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114444,"mean":7.8911216588171,"rank":20814,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":93557,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114444,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8035,"mean":13.519103310929,"rank":3283,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4737,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8035,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108,"mean":13.072355140187,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":64,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2,"practitioner":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":5,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":4,"Associate Professor":1,"Assistant Professor":1,"Post Doc":3,"Ph.D. Student":3,"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)":1,"Researcher (at a non-Academic Institution)":2,"Other Professional":2,"Student (Postgraduate)":4,"Student (Master)":6,"Student (Bachelor)":1,"Senior Lecturer":1,"Lecturer":1,"Doctoral Student":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine":25,"Biological Sciences":3,"Materials Science":2,"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":5,"CL":1,"US":1,"CA":1,"BA":1},"mendeley":{"SG":1,"BR":1,"ES":1,"ZA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/monalisa1n\/status\/387277666342436864","license":"public","citation_ids":[1808946],"posted_on":"2013-10-07T18:06:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Mona Nasser","url":"https:\/\/monanasser.wordpress.com\/about\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/902675605686280192\/9UerNAaL_normal.jpg","description":"Associate Professor in Evidence Based Dentistry @pupsmd \/pilot\/skydiver\/yoga teacher\/ amateur artist & aerialist \/wannabe astronaut @capsmg @astro_mona","id_on_source":"monalisa1n","tweeter_id":"41491084","geo":{"lt":50.37153,"ln":-4.14305,"country":"GB"},"followers":2551},"tweet_id":"387277666342436864"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BrushDJ\/status\/466579788938100736","license":"datasift","rt":["CochraneOHG"],"citation_ids":[1808946],"posted_on":"2014-05-14T14:04:25+00:00","author":{"name":"Brush DJ","url":"http:\/\/www.brushdj.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/708779161939288065\/ru1l2JNL_normal.jpg","description":"Award-winning free app that works with any toothbrush to make brushing fun!
