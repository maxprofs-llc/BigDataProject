Because headache is not a prominent symptom, the diagnosis might be challenging. The objective of the study was to evaluate the frequency and outcome of migraine equivalents. This was a retrospective study. We included benign paroxysmal torticollis of infancy, benign paroxysmal vertigo of infancy, abdominal migraine, cyclic vomiting, aura without migraine, and confusional migraine. We evaluated the frequency of events, treatment, and outcome. Out of 674 children with headache, 38 (5.6%) presented with migraine equivalents. Twenty-one were boys and the mean age was 6.1 years. Fifteen had abdominal migraine, 12 benign paroxysmal vertigo, 5 confusional migraine, 3 aura without migraine, 2 paroxysmal torticollis, and 1 cyclic vomiting. Prophylactic treatment was introduced in 23 patients; 4 lost follow-up and 19 had significant improvement. We conclude that the correct diagnosis of migraine equivalents enables an effective treatment with an excellent outcome.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000c9e","authors":["K.
