This study evaluates patient preference and satisfaction with ciclesonide hydrofluoroalkane nasal aerosol (CIC-HFA) compared with mometasone furoate aqueous nasal spray (MFNS). Symptomatic subjects with perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR) were randomized to CIC-HFA at 74 micrograms or MFNS at 200 micrograms q.d. in an open-label, two-period, crossover study. Subject preference was recorded as total preference score (TPS; average of 17 individual preference items) at the end of treatment period 2, and satisfaction was assessed with a 76-item, self-administered instrument at baseline and at the end of each 2-week treatment period. The primary assessments were TPS and regimen attributes composite satisfaction score composed of two of nine satisfaction subscales: sensory impact (including medication running out of the nose, medication running down the throat, and impact on smell and taste) and regimen management (comprised of issues relating to dosing and ability to remember to take medication). Two hundred ninety-four subjects completed the study. A total of 68.1% of subjects preferred CIC-HFA (p less than 0.0001 versus MFNS), with a mean TPS of 68.3 versus 31.7 for the MFNS group. The regimen attributes composite satisfaction score significantly (p less than 0.0001 for each treatment period) favored CIC-HFA versus MFNS at the end of treatment period 1 (85.5 vs 77.6) and treatment period 2 (83.0 versus 73.5), respectively. In this study, subjects reported higher preference for and satisfaction with CIC-HFA compared with MFNS, suggesting significant differences in patient perception of attributes in favor of CIC-HFA.
