Characterization of multi-drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis using Ion Torrent"],"citation":{"abstract":"Drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacterium (MTB) is spreading worldwide. Three drug-resistant isolates were detected in Burmese, Hmong, and Indian immigrants currently residing in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA. Ion Torrent full-gene sequencing and complete genetic analysis was performed within 5 days and compared to results from traditional drug sensitivity testing (DST). Genetic characterization of seven, full-length resistance-associated genes revealed two MDR and one highly resistant strain with important drug-resistant mutations that were confirmed by traditional DST. The rapid turnaround from sample-to-sequence underscores the public health value of Ion Torrent full-gene sequencing of MDR\/XDR genes from epidemiologically significant clinical isolates.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f610006544","authors":["L T Daum","G W Fischer","J Sromek","M Khubbar","P Hunter","M S Gradus","S Bhattacharyya","L.
