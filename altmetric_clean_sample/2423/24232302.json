However, molecular events happened in both the acupunctured site and the internal organs after EA stimulation have not been clarified.\nHere we applied transcriptomic analysis to explore the gene expression signatures after EA stimulation. Mice were applied EA stimulation at ST36 for 15\u00a0min and nine tissues were collected three hours later for microarray analysis.\nWe found that EA affected the expression of genes not only in the acupunctured site but also in the internal organs. EA commonly affected biological networks involved in cytoskeleton and cell adhesion, and also regulated unique process networks in specific organs, such as \u03b3-aminobutyric acid-ergic neurotransmission in brain and inflammation process in lung. In addition, EA affected the expression of genes related to various diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases in brain and obstructive pulmonary diseases in lung.\nThis report applied, for the first time, a global comprehensive genome-wide approach to analyze the gene expression profiling of acupunctured site and internal organs after EA stimulation. The connection between gene expression signatures, biological processes, and diseases might provide a basis for prediction and explanation on the therapeutic potentials of acupuncture in organs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b0","authors":["Jing-Shan Wu","Hsin-Yi Lo","Chia-Cheng Li","Feng-Yuan Chen","Chien-Yun Hsiang","Tin-Yun Ho"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12906-017-1911-0","first_seen_on":"2017-08-23T17:51:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1472-6882"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1503978397,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5556347\/"],"pmid":"28810910","pubdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chiropractic Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Complementary & Alternative Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"Comprehensive evaluation of gene expression signatures in response to electroacupuncture stimulation at Zusanli (ST36) acupoint by transcriptomic analysis","type":"article","volume":"17"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":2.25,"6m":2.25,"3m":2.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":3568720,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4823369,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184922,"mean":12.721199117461,"rank":68821,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":114035,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184922,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2131,"mean":6.6162122065728,"rank":783,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":1315,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2131,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":4.3458461538462,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HerbsAndNeedles\/statuses\/900415093560688640","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24232302],"posted_on":"2017-08-23T17:51:01+00:00","author":{"name":"Christina Leigh Acu","url":"http:\/\/www.ChristinaLeighAcupuncture.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/665048704374566912\/pgtVx54P_normal.jpg","description":"Board Certified Acupuncturist, Back Pain Specialist, Chinese Medical Practitioner #CLA","id_on_source":"HerbsAndNeedles","tweeter_id":"216826993","geo":{"lt":33.03699,"ln":-117.29198,"country":"US"},"followers":55},"tweet_id":"900415093560688640"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/QiOttawa\/statuses\/902376920549089284","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24232302],"posted_on":"2017-08-29T03:46:37+00:00","author":{"name":"J.P. - 613- (R.Acu)","url":"http:\/\/www.myosense.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643651788306931712\/LZtSK0sm_normal.jpg","description":"Acupuncture - Qi Gong - TCM - Fitness -Rehabilitation - Performance Enhancement -","id_on_source":"QiOttawa","tweeter_id":"28034828","geo":{"lt":45.41117,"ln":-75.69812,"country":"CA"},"followers":376},"tweet_id":"902376920549089284"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Comprehensive evaluation of gene expression signatures in response to electroacupuncture stimulation at Zusanli (ST36) acupoint by transcriptomic analysis","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1736074463099774&id=139718452735391","license":"public","citation_ids":[24232302],"posted_on":"2017-08-29T03:38:01+00:00","summary":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5556347\/","author":{"name":"Qigong Institute","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/139718452735391","facebook_wall_name":"Qigong Institute","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/139718452735391\/picture","id_on_source":"139718452735391"}}]}}
