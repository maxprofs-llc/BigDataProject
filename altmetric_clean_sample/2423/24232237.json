Furthermore, immunofluorescence was used to locate ETAR expression in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (HSECs), we calculated the percentage of positive cells and then analyzed its relation with clinical indexes.\nAccording to the western blotting analysis, the expression of ETAR was high in hepatic hemangioma and liver cancer tissues and ETBR was highly expressed in cirrhosis tissues. The immunofluorescence results demonstrated that the expression of ETAR was elevated in hepatic hemangioma and liver cancer tissues. Moreover, ETAR expression was found in both HSCs and HSECs. Finally, the statistical analysis revealed that the number of positive ETAR cells was correlated with the clinical index platelets (PLT), alanine transaminase (ALT) and diameter of portal vein.\nEndothelin receptors express differently in liver cirrhosis and liver cancer tissues and play a role in hepatic diseases by affecting HSCs and HSECs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dc7","authors":["Juhong Deng","Yu Huang","Ran Tao","Xiangxue Fan","Hongyue Zhang","Hongyan Kong","Qiqing Song","Jiaquan Huang"],"doi":"10.1080\/15384047.2017.1360451","first_seen_on":"2017-08-23T17:50:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1538-4047","1555-8576"],"journal":"Cancer Biology and Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1503510609,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/15384047.2017.1360451?journalCode=kcbt20"],"pmid":"28812426","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"The Expression of ETAR in Liver Cirrhosis and Liver Cancer","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":7275600,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169966,"mean":12.724505033389,"rank":139391,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169966,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2113,"mean":1.1261685606061,"rank":771,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2113,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.1,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/hepaticcellnews\/statuses\/900414872198008832","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24232237],"posted_on":"2017-08-23T17:50:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Hepatic Cell News","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/812082306210893824\/sFNve1xh_normal.jpg","description":"The online resource for the hepatic cell community.
