However, the role of l-arginine transport in VL still remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrated that intra-macrophage survival of L. donovani depends on the availability of extracellular l-arginine. Infection of THP-1-derived macrophage\/human monocyte-derived macrophage (hMDM) with Leishmania, resulted in upregulation of l-arginine transport. While investigating the involvement of the transporters, we observed that Leishmania survival was greatly impaired when the transporters were blocked either using inhibitor or siRNA-mediated downregulation. CAT-2 was found to be the main isoform associated with l-arginine transport in L. donovani-infected macrophages. l-arginine availability and its transport regulated the host arginase in Leishmania infection. Arginase and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression were reciprocally regulated when assayed using specific inhibitors and siRNA-mediated downregulation. Interestingly, induction of iNOS expression and nitric oxide production were observed in case of inhibition of arginase in infected macrophages. Furthermore, inhibition of l-arginine transport as well as arginase resulted in decreased polyamine production, limiting parasite survival inside macrophages. l-arginine availability and transport regulated Th1\/Th2 cytokine levels in case of Leishmania infection. Upregulation of l-arginine transport, induction of host arginase, and enhanced polyamine production were correlated with increased level of IL-10 and decreased level of IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1 in L. donovani-infected macrophages. Our findings provide clear evidence for targeting the metabolism of l-arginine and l-arginine-metabolizing enzymes as an important therapeutic and prophylactic strategy to treat VL.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90c3cf058f61000cb02","authors":["Mandal, Abhishek","Das, Sushmita","Kumar, Ajay","Roy, Saptarshi","Verma, Sudha","Ghosh, Ayan Kumar","Singh, Ruby","Abhishek, Kumar","Saini, Savita","Sardar, Abul Hasan","Purkait, Bidyut","Kumar, Ashish","Mandal, Chitra","Das, Pradeep"],"doi":"10.3389\/fimmu.2017.00839","first_seen_on":"2017-08-23T21:51:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1664-3224"],"journal":"Frontiers in immunology","last_mentioned_on":1503525067,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fimmu.2017.00839\/full?utm_source=S-TWT&utm_medium=SNET&utm_campaign=ECO_FIMMU_XXXXXXXX_auto-dlvrit"],"pmcid":"PMC5526900","pmid":"28798743","pubdate":"2017-07-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"l-Arginine Uptake by Cationic Amino Acid Transporter Promotes Intra-Macrophage Survival of Leishmania donovani by Enhancing Arginase-Mediated Polyamine Synthesis","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/larginine-uptake-cationic-amino-acid-transporter-promotes-intramacrophage-survival-leishmania-donova"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":7275601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169965,"mean":12.724520474924,"rank":139391,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169965,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3725,"mean":3.0974731471536,"rank":3009,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3725,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147,"mean":3.3417123287671,"rank":121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CH":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/FrontImmunol\/statuses\/900475514640449536","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24238078],"posted_on":"2017-08-23T21:51:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Frontiers Immunology","url":"http:\/\/frontiersin.org\/Immunology","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/533290695813918721\/D6Z7R9Qu_normal.jpeg","description":"The official Twitter Feed for all the latest open-access peer-reviewed articles appearing in Frontiers in Immunology.
