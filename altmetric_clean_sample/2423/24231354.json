The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 30 days. Mean patient age was 83.7\u00b14.4 years and logistic EuroSCORE-I was 26.5\u00b17.7%. Procedural success was obtained in 84 patients (94.4%). At 30 days, 3 patients had died, and 2 major strokes and one reintervention for a ventricular septal defect occurred, leading to a major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event rate (MACCE) rate of 6.7%. Eight patients (10.3%) received a permanent pacemaker. At one year, 20 patients (22.5%) had died and MACCE rate was 27%. Effective orifice area was 1.76\u00b10.34 cm\u00b2, and mean gradient 7.5\u00b12.8 mmHg. Only three patients (4.5%) had moderate paravalvular regurgitation. NYHA class III\/ IV was present in 94.4% of patients at baseline, in 9.9% at 30 days and in 4.5% at one year post-procedure.\nThis first-in-human experience with a novel self-expanding heart valve showed low rates of procedural mortality, major strokes and pacemaker implantation, and good performance outcomes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9133cf058f61000ccce","authors":["M\u00f6llmann Helge","M\u00f6llmann Helge","Walther Thomas","Walther Thomas","Siqueira Dimytri","Siqueira Dimytri","Diemert Patrick","Diemert Patrick","Treede Hendrick","Treede Hendrick","Grube Eberhard","Grube Eberhard","Nickenig Georg","Nickenig Georg","Baldus Stephan","Baldus Stephan","Rudolph Tanja K.","Rudolph Tanja K.","Kuratani Toru","Kuratani Toru","Sawa Yoshiki","Sawa Yoshiki","Kempfert J\u00f6rg","Kempfert J\u00f6rg","Kim Won-Keun","Kim Won-Keun","Abizaid Alexandre","Abizaid Alexandre"],"doi":"10.4244\/eij-d-17-00187","first_seen_on":"2017-08-23T17:23:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1969-6213"],"journal":"EuroIntervention","last_mentioned_on":1503240660,"links":["https:\/\/www.pcronline.com\/eurointervention\/ahead-of-print\/JAA_EIJ_EIJ-D-17-00187\/transfemoral-tavi-using-the-self-expandable-acurate-neotm-prosthesis-one-year-outcomes-of-the-multicenter-quotce-approval-cohortquot.html"],"pmid":"28804056","publisher":"Europa Digital & Publishing","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Transfemoral TAVI using the self-expandable ACURATE neo(TM) prosthesis: one-year outcomes of the multicenter \"CE-approval-cohort\".","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transfemoral-tavi-using-selfexpandable-acurate-neotm-prosthesis-oneyear-outcomes-multicenter-ceappro"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8403724,"mean":7.0757025513494,"rank":7263541,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8403724,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161186,"mean":12.674430188913,"rank":132065,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161186,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":826,"mean":4.4731466666667,"rank":667,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":826,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":8.5459677419355,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1678011975565930&id=207119029321906","license":"public","citation_ids":[24231354],"posted_on":"2017-08-20T14:51:00+00:00","summary":"Transfemoral TAVI using the self-expandable ACURATE neoTM prosthesis: one-year outcomes of the multicenter \"CE-approval-cohort\" by Helge M\u00f6llmann et al.\n\nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/2wdoP3X","author":{"name":"EuroIntervention","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/207119029321906","facebook_wall_name":"EuroIntervention","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/207119029321906\/picture","id_on_source":"207119029321906"}}]}}
