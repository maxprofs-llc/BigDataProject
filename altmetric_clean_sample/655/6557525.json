Prognosis is poor due to lack of effective comprehensive treatments. In this study, we assessed the expression of Gab1, VEGFR-2, and MMP-9 in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma solid tumors by immunohistochemistry and determined whether their expression was associated with clinical and pathological features. We found that expression of Gab1, VEGFR-2, and MMP-9 was highly and positively correlated with each other and with lymph node metastasis and TNM stage in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma tissues. Interference of Gab1 and VEGFR-2 expression via siRNA in the intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cell line RBE resulted in decreased PI3K\/Akt pathway activity. Inhibition of Gab1 and VEGFR-2 expression also caused decreased cell proliferation, cell cycle arrested in G1 phase, increased apoptosis, and decreased invasion in RBE cells. These results suggest that Gab1, VEGFR-2, and MMP-9 contribute significantly to the highly malignant behavior of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The regulation of growth, apoptosis, and invasion by Gab1 through the VEGFR-2\/Gab1\/PI3K\/Akt signaling pathway may represent potential targets for improving the treatment of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008c15","authors":["Sang, Haiquan","Li, Tingting","Li, Hangyu","Liu, Jingang"],"doi":"10.1007\/s13277-015-3590-0","endpage":"8377","first_seen_on":"2016-04-08T11:40:02+00:00","issns":["1423-0380","1010-4283"],"issue":"11","journal":"Tumor Biology","last_mentioned_on":1460114846,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26014518?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26014518?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26014518","pubdate":"2015-05-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"8367","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Gab1 regulates proliferation and migration through the PI3K\/Akt signaling pathway in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gab1-regulates-proliferation-migration-through-pi3kakt-signaling-pathway-intrahepatic-cholangiocarci-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7520778,"mean":6.5030037002784,"rank":5693043,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1006110,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7520778,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270905,"mean":11.250230458022,"rank":190421,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":41973,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270905,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1777,"mean":1.0776509009009,"rank":704,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":715,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1777,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":0.94625,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
