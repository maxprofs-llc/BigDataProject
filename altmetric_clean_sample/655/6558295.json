Here, we describe the cultivation and characterization of strain CV58T, a novel member of the Gammaproteobacteria order Pseudomonadales isolated from the guts of Cephalotes varians ants. Strain CV58T was rod-shaped, Gram-negative, non-motile, and formed pale-yellow colonies on trypticase soy agar. Optimum growth occurred under an atmosphere of 4-20% O2. Growth was possible for strain CV58T under NaCl concentrations between 0-1.5%, temperatures between 23-40oC, and pH values between 5.5-8.5. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 54.9 mol % and the major fatty acids were C18:1\u03c97c, C16:0, C16:1\u03c97c\/C16:1\u03c96c, C12:0, and C12:03OH. The only respiratory quinone detected was ubiquinone-9 (Q-9) and the major polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and diphosphatidylglycerol. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence, strain CV58T shared an 88.3% nucleotide identity with its closest cultivated neighbor Pseudomonas putida R43. We believe that this, combined with the housekeeping gene phylogeny, differences in phenotypic characteristics, and cellular fatty acid composition from other cultivated members indicates that strain CV58T represents a new species occupying a novel genus and family within Pseudomonadales. Thus, we propose the name Ventosimonadaceae fam nov., followed by Ventosimonas gracilis gen. nov., sp. nov., to classify strain CV58T (= NCIMB 15011T = DSM 100910T).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079fb","authors":["Lin, Jonathan Y","Hobson, William J","Wertz, John T"],"doi":"10.1099\/ijsem.0.001068","first_seen_on":"2016-04-08T12:11:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1466-5034","1466-5026"],"journal":"International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1460116991,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27054961?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27054961","pubdate":"2016-04-07T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Ventosimonas gracilis gen. nov., sp. nov., a member of the Gammaproteobacteria isolated from Cephalotes varians ant guts representing a new family, Ventosimonadaceae fam. nov., within the order 'Pseudomonadales'","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7520778,"mean":6.5030037002784,"rank":3881785,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2103963,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7520778,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270904,"mean":11.250269033565,"rank":147312,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":96180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270904,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3458,"mean":2.6838698293318,"rank":2470,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":816,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3458,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120,"mean":1.2155462184874,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":72,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/pseudo_papers\/statuses\/718408850362109952","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6558295],"posted_on":"2016-04-08T12:03:11+00:00","author":{"name":"pseudomonaspapers","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/?term=pseudomonas","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/570219565901029376\/j3RfXxUz_normal.jpeg","description":"PubMed search bot for pseudomonas.
