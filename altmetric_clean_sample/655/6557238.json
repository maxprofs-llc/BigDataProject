It consists of many elements that require collaboration and strategic leadership to achieve an efficient, effective, knowledgeable, resilient, and prepared citizenry. We strongly believe the public can and should act as immediate responders to stop bleeding from all hazards, including active shooter and intentional mass casualty events. The ACS has a long history of setting standards and educating responders through its Committee on Trauma and its programs. The ACS is therefore well-positioned to use its national and international networks to implement bleeding control education to improve survival and enhance resilience.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100057a7","authors":["Jacobs, Lenworth M",", "],"first_seen_on":"2016-04-08T11:28:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0002-8045"],"issue":"3","journal":"Bulletin of the American College of Surgeons","last_mentioned_on":1460111402,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27051933?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27051933","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["healthservices","generalsurgery"],"title":"The Hartford Consensus IV: A Call for Increased National Resilience.","type":"article","volume":"101","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hartford-consensus-iv-call-increased-national-resilience"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7520778,"mean":6.5030037002784,"rank":6514697,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7520778,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270904,"mean":11.25027567801,"rank":228928,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270904,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":2.0825945945946,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.33333333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Business, Management and Accounting":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/statuses\/718385407407300608","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6557238],"posted_on":"2016-04-08T10:30:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":439},"tweet_id":"718385407407300608"}]}}
