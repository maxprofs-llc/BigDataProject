Epo and its receptors are expressed in many tissues, such as the brain and heart. The presence of Epo\/Epo receptors in these organs suggests other roles than those usually assigned to this protein. Thus, the aim of this review is to describe the effects of Epo deficiency on adaptation to normoxic and hypoxic environments and to suggest a key role of Epo on main physiological adaptive functions. Our original model of Epo-deficient (Epo-TAg(h)) mice allowed us to improve our knowledge of the possible role of Epo in O2 homeostasis. The use of anemic transgenic mice revealed Epo as a crucial component of adaptation to hypoxia. Epo-TAg(h) mice survive well in hypoxic conditions despite low hematocrit. Furthermore, Epo plays a key role in neural control of ventilatory acclimatization and response to hypoxia, in deformability of red blood cells, in cerebral and cardiac angiogenesis, and in neuro- and cardioprotection.","altmetric_jid":"56b367f52a83eea9718b45ee","authors":["Jean-Paul Richalet","Aur\u00e9lien Pichon","Nicolas Voituron","Mich\u00e8le Beaudry","Florine Jeton","Raja El Hasnaoui-Saadani","Luciana Hagstr\u00f6m","Thierry Launay","Dominique Marchant","Patricia Quidu","Jos\u00e9-Luis Macarlupu","Fabrice Favret"],"doi":"10.2147\/hp.s83540","first_seen_on":"2016-04-08T02:05:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2324-1128"],"journal":"Hypoxia","last_mentioned_on":1460081116,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/erythropoietin-and-the-use-of-a-transgenic-model-of-erythropoietin-def-peer-reviewed-article-HP"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=29787","pmid":"27800506","pubdate":"2016-04-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","title":"Erythropoietin and the use of a transgenic model of erythropoietin-deficient mice","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/erythropoietin-transgenic-model-erythropoietindeficient-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7520778,"mean":6.5030037002784,"rank":5693037,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1006140,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7520778,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270904,"mean":11.25031093048,"rank":190424,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":41983,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270904,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":1.5596551724138,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.8642857142857,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
