However, the role and mechanisms for metformin in preventing cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity remains largely unknown. In this study, a single intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin was employed to induce acute kidney injury (AKI) in CD1 mice. The mice exhibited severe kidney dysfunction and histological damage at day 2 after cisplatin injection. Pretreatment of metformin could markedly attenuate cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury, tubular cell apoptosis and inflammatory cell accumulation in the kidneys. Additionally, pretreatment of metformin could enhance both AMPK\u03b1 phosphorylation and autophagy induction in the kidneys after cisplatin injection. In cultured NRK-52E cells, a rat kidney tubular cell line, metformin could stimulate AMPK\u03b1 phosphorylation, induce autophagy and inhibit cisplatin-induced cell apoptosis. Blockade of either AMPK\u03b1 activation or autophagy induction could largely abolish the protective effect of metformin in cisplatin-induced cell death. Together, this study demonstrated that metformin may protect against cisplatin-induced tubular cell apoptosis and AKI through stimulating AMPK\u03b1 activation and autophagy induction in the tubular cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Li, Jianzhong","Gui, Yuan","Ren, Jiafa","Liu, Xin","Feng, Ye","Zeng, Zhifeng","He, Weichun","Yang, Junwei","Dai, Chunsun"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep23975","first_seen_on":"2016-04-08T11:10:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1460109698,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27052588?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27052588","pubdate":"2016-04-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cell death","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Acute kidney injury","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"23975","subjects":["science"],"title":"Metformin Protects Against Cisplatin-Induced Tubular Cell Apoptosis and Acute Kidney Injury via AMPK\u03b1-regulated Autophagy Induction","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metformin-protects-against-cisplatininduced-tubular-cell-apoptosis-acute-kidney-injury-via-ampk%CE%B1regu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7520778,"mean":6.5030037002784,"rank":6514679,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7520778,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270904,"mean":11.250266265047,"rank":228918,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270904,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28772,"mean":14.701348024052,"rank":24633,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28772,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2775,"mean":16.076286229272,"rank":2397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2775,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
