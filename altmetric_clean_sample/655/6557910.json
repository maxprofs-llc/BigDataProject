Fish were fed six different experimental diets containing graded levels of valine (4.3, 8.0, 10.6, 13.1, 16.7, 19.1 g\/kg). The results indicated that valine deficiency decreased Claudin b, Claudin 3, Occludin and ZO-1 transcription and increased Claudin 15 expression in the fish gill (P < 0.05). These effects were partly due to the down-regulation of interleukin 10 (IL-10), transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) and I\u03baB \u03b1 and the up-regulation of relative mRNA expression of interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin 8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and nuclear factor \u03baB P65 (NF-\u03baB P65) (P < 0.05). However, valine deficiency and valine supplementation did not have a signi\ufb01cant effect on Claudin c and Claudin 12 expression in grass carp gills (P > 0.05). Valine de\ufb01ciency also disrupted antioxidant status in the gill by decreasing anti-superoxide radicals and hydroxyl radical capacity, glutathione contents and the activities and mRNA levels of Cu\/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) (P < 0.05). These results may be ascribed to the down-regulation of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), target of rapamycin (TOR) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and the up-regulation of Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) (P < 0.05). Additionally, valine deficiency induced DNA fragmentation via the up-regulation of Caspase 3, Caspase 8 and Caspase 9 expressions (P < 0.05). These results may be ascribed to the improvement in ROS levels in the fish gill (P < 0.05). Taken together, the results showed that valine deficiency impaired the structural integrity of fish gill by disrupted fish antioxidant defenses and regulating the expression of tight junction protein, cytokines, antioxidant enzymes, NF-\u03baB p65, I\u03baB\u03b1, TOR, Nrf2, Keap1 and apoptosis-related genes in the fish gill.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028d8","authors":["Feng, Lin","Luo, Jian-Bo","Jiang, Wei-Dan","Liu, Yang","Wu, Pei","Jiang, Jun","Kuang, Sheng-Yao","Tang, Ling","Zhang, Yong-An","Zhou, Xiao-Qiu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.fsi.2015.04.023","endpage":"249","first_seen_on":"2016-04-08T11:55:59+00:00","issns":["1095-9947","10504648"],"issue":"2","journal":"Fish & Shellfish Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1460114977,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25917968?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25917968","pubdate":"2015-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Fisheries Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"239","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Changes in barrier health status of the gill for grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) during valine deficiency: Regulation of tight junction protein transcript, antioxidant status and apoptosis-related gene expression","type":"article","volume":"45","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/changes-barrier-health-status-gill-grass-carp-ctenopharyngodon-idella-during-valine-deficiency-regul"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7520778,"mean":6.5030037002784,"rank":6514710,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7520778,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270905,"mean":11.250230458022,"rank":228932,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270905,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1070,"mean":0.96854256314312,"rank":673,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1070,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85,"mean":0.72883333333333,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
