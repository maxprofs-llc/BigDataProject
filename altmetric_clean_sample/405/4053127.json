The nanogels have a cross-linked temperature responsive core and a dense carbohydrate shell. Their thermoresponsive nature allowed the controlled encapsulation of IAZA drug, in hypoxic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) mediated uptake, and also the release. The synthesized nanogel-IAZA delivery systems demonstrated a stable, non-burst release of IAZA over 10 hours with up to 0.6 mM loading capacity of IAZA within the nanogel. The cytotoxicity evaluations of the nanogels demonstrated that they are relatively non-toxic in multiple cell lines. The radiosensitization studies indicated that IAZA in encapsulated form offers a superior radiosensitization of hypoxic cells (sensitizer enhancement ratio (SER) for IAZA alone, 1.33; and 1.62 for nanogel encapsulated IAZA, respectively). These studies suggest that galactose-based nanogels may serve as a versatile drug delivery system for IAZA (and other azomycin-based agents) and enable its hypoxia-selective multimodal theranostic applications to manage hypoxic solid (hepatocellular) tumors by facilitating Position\/Single Photon Emission Tomography (PET\/SPET)-based imaging, external beam radiation therapy (XRT) and in situ molecular radiotherapy (MRT).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023e5","authors":["Quan, Stephen","Wang, Yinan","Zhou, Aihua","Kumar, Piyush","Narain, Ravin"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.biomac.5b00576","first_seen_on":"2015-05-24T00:01:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1526-4602"],"journal":"Biomacromolecules","last_mentioned_on":1432425667,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25996799?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25996799","pubdate":"2015-05-24T22:03:41+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Galactose-based Thermosensitive Nanogels for Targeted Drug Delivery of Iodoazomycin Arabinofuranoside (IAZA) for Theranostic Management of Hypoxic Hepatocellular Carcinoma.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/galactosebased-thermosensitive-nanogels-targeted-drug-delivery-iodoazomycin-arabinofuranoside-iaza-t"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5133432,"mean":6.0721600422813,"rank":4269027,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5133432,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172928,"mean":8.9171439740469,"rank":142339,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172928,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":740,"mean":4.6962327469553,"rank":540,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":740,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":6.1874285714286,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
