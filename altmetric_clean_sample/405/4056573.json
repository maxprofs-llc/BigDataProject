We thus conducted a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies to examine the relationship between tea consumption and endometrial cancer risk, using a random-effects model. We identified 5\u00a0eligible cohort studies, which included 231,870\u00a0female participants and 1831\u00a0cases for endometrial cancer. The pooled relative risk (RR) for the highest (median 2\u00a0cups\/day) vs. no\/lowest category of tea consumption on endometrial cancer risk was 0.95 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.80-1.12] with no significant heterogeneity (P for heterogeneity = 0.68, I(2) = 0.0%). By country of origin, the pooled RR of 3 studies conducted in the United States was 1.00 (95% CI: 0.83-1.21), in which black tea was consumed by most people. Because of limited data on Asian population, the association of green tea on endometrial cancer was not calculated separately. There was no indication of publication bias (Begg's P = 0.46; Egger's P = 0.43). Our findings from prospective data do not support a role of tea consumption in endometrial carcinogenesis. More prospective cohort studies with green tea consumption should be conducted.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f61000149f","authors":["Je, Youjin","Park, Taeyoung"],"doi":"10.1080\/01635581.2015.1040521","first_seen_on":"2015-05-25T20:29:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-7914"],"journal":"Nutrition and Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1432589960,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25996185"],"pmid":"25996185","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Tea Consumption and Endometrial Cancer Risk: Meta-Analysis of Prospective Cohort Studies.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tea-consumption-endometrial-cancer-risk-metaanalysis-prospective-cohort-studies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5141487,"mean":6.0806919019129,"rank":2691455,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2426325,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5141487,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172667,"mean":8.8755112181901,"rank":96977,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":74706,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172667,"percentile":43},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":659,"mean":6.0730790273556,"rank":365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":291,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":659,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":2.109,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Computer Science":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/snchez_manu\/status\/602952111085776898","license":"datasift","rt":["gineblog"],"citation_ids":[4056573],"posted_on":"2015-05-25T21:39:20+00:00","author":{"name":"Manu S\u00e1nchez Prieto","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2756220381\/f52d688052f75398a46fbbd99f93c28c_normal.png","id_on_source":"snchez_manu","tweeter_id":"434969072","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":127},"tweet_id":"602952111085776898"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/gineblog\/status\/602934316251877376","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4056573],"posted_on":"2015-05-25T20:28:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Gineblog","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/604008544418021379\/WuleYdhA_normal.jpg","description":"Our mission to care about women\u2019s health and related issues.
