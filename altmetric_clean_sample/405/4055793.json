{"altmetric_id":4055793,"selected_quotes":["Do community-based videos help raise awareness about integrating nutrition into existing ag programs?"],"citation":{"abstract":"The nutrition challenge in South Asia is complex due to its varying scale from hunger to hidden hunger. The region has the highest rates of hunger and under nutrition in the world, and overweight and obesity is increasing in prevalence, especially in India. These complex and multi-causal nutritional challenges need to be met with equally varying cross-sectoral interventions. A pilot program was conducted in partnership with the Bihar Rural Livelihoods Promotion Society (also known as JEEViKA) to investigate how locally produced videos could increase community knowledge and the adoption of improved nutrition practices, as well as evaluate the feasibility of integrating nutrition information into the existing agricultural program. The pilot targeted 42 villages in three districts. This note presents the key findings of piloting the participatory nutrition messaging videos. The objective of the pilot was to develop community-based instructional videos on nutrition topics (including food preparation, dietary diversity, crops rich in vitamin A, kitchen gardens) to enable access to and adoption of best practices bycommunity members.","authors":["Pandey, Ritika","Pehu,Eija","Gandhi, Rikin","Havimo,Terhi Elisa"],"first_seen_on":"2015-05-25T11:46:17+00:00","issns":[],"last_mentioned_on":1432710940,"links":["http:\/\/documents.worldbank.org\/curated\/en\/2015\/04\/24433777\/promoting-agriculture-nutrition-convergence-through-participatory-extension-videos"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www-wds.worldbank.org\/external\/default\/WDSContentServer\/WDSP\/IB\/2015\/04\/30\/090224b082e289b3\/Rendered\/PDF\/Promoting0agri0ory0extension0videos.pdf","pubdate":"2015-04-01T00:46:01+00:00","startpage":"1","title":"Promoting agriculture nutrition convergence through participatory extension videos","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/documents.worldbank.org\/curated\/en\/24433777"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.05,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.05},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"IN":1}}},"counts":{"total":{"posts_count":4},"twitter":{"unique_users_count":4,"unique_users":["WBG_Agriculture","IMMANA_res","Sanket_Kapadnis","FaraiGwelo"],"posts_count":4}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/WBG_Agriculture\/status\/602802623431999488","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4055793],"posted_on":"2015-05-25T11:45:19+00:00","author":{"name":"WBG Agriculture","url":"http:\/\/worldbank.org\/agriculture","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/785551805929455617\/mECZeqmB_normal.jpg","description":"The World Bank works with developing countries on agriculture to improve global food security and livelihoods for millions of rural poor.","id_on_source":"WBG_Agriculture","tweeter_id":"233606438","geo":{"lt":38.91706,"ln":-77.00025,"country":"US"},"followers":26100},"tweet_id":"602802623431999488"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/IMMANA_res\/status\/602803445150654464","license":"datasift","rt":["WBG_Agriculture"],"citation_ids":[4055793],"posted_on":"2015-05-25T11:48:35+00:00","author":{"name":"IMMANA","url":"http:\/\/www.lcirah.ac.uk\/immana","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/534741072363003904\/_IEv-CvR_normal.jpeg","description":"IMMANA is a new research programme that aims to generate innovative methods and metrics in agriculture for nutrition.","id_on_source":"IMMANA_res","tweeter_id":"2882781593","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":764},"tweet_id":"602803445150654464"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Sanket_Kapadnis\/status\/602819686976237569","license":"datasift","rt":["WBG_Agriculture"],"citation_ids":[4055793],"posted_on":"2015-05-25T12:53:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Sanket P Kapadnis","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/876137751250427904\/tw2uqa02_normal.jpg","description":"Aspiring first generation Entrepreneur,\r\nFounder - Aishwari Agro Foods- Agro Produce Supply Chain Management Company","id_on_source":"Sanket_Kapadnis","tweeter_id":"446379966","geo":{"lt":19.03681,"ln":73.01582,"country":"IN"},"followers":668},"tweet_id":"602819686976237569"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/FaraiGwelo\/status\/603459537656520704","license":"datasift","rt":["WBG_Agriculture"],"citation_ids":[4055793],"posted_on":"2015-05-27T07:15:40+00:00","author":{"name":"Farai Alice Gwelo","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/523077028661452800\/u8rIt1KQ_normal.jpeg","description":"Natural scientist passionate about #Agriculture #foodsecurity in relation to #ClimateChange policy & advocacy in #Africa @FANRPAN","id_on_source":"FaraiGwelo","tweeter_id":"2414803679","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":112},"tweet_id":"603459537656520704"}]}}
