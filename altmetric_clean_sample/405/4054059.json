We assessed its spectrum of bactericidal activity and mechanism of action in this study. The compound's minimal bactericidal concentrations for 30-, 60-, and 180-second exposure was determined with the microdilution method using a neutralizer against 320 bacterial strains from culture collections and clinical isolates. Based on the results, estimated bactericidal olanexidine concentrations with 180-second exposure were 869 \u03bcg\/ml for Gram-positive cocci (155 strains), 109 \u03bcg\/ml for Gram-positive bacilli (29 strains), and 434 \u03bcg\/ml for Gram-negative bacteria (136 strains). Olanexidine was active against a wide range of bacteria, especially Gram-positive cocci, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococi, and had a comparable spectrum of bactericidal activity to those of commercial antiseptics such as chlorhexidine and povidone iodine. In vitro experiments exploring its mechanism of action indicated that olanexidine 1) interacts with the bacterial surface molecules, such as lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid; 2) disrupts the cell membranes of liposomes, which are artificial bacterial membrane models; 3) enhances the membrane permeability of Escherichia coli; 4) disrupts the membrane integrity of Staphylococcus aureus; and 5) denatures proteins at relatively high concentrations (160 \u03bcg\/ml or higher). These results indicate that olanexidine probably binds to the cell membrane and disrupts membrane integrity and that its bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects are caused by irreversible leakage of intracellular components. At relatively high concentrations, olanexidine aggregates cells by denaturing proteins. This mechanism differs slightly from that of similar biguanide compound, chlorhexidine.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a6a","authors":["Akifumi Hagi","Koushi Iwata","Takuya Nii","Hikaru Nakata","Yoshie Tsubotani","Yasuhide Inoue"],"doi":"10.1128\/aac.05048-14","first_seen_on":"2015-05-24T14:31:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1098-6596"],"journal":"Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1432479478,"links":["http:\/\/aac.asm.org\/content\/early\/2015\/05\/12\/AAC.05048-14.full.pdf+html"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/aac.asm.org\/content\/early\/2015\/05\/12\/AAC.05048-14.full.pdf","pmid":"25987609","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["drugtherapy"],"title":"Bactericidal effects and mechanism of action of olanexidine gluconate, a new antiseptic","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bactericidal-effects-mechanism-action-olanexidine-gluconate-new-antiseptic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5137613,"mean":6.0774853371559,"rank":3607846,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":865243,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5137613,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172985,"mean":8.9193838967767,"rank":123553,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":30595,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172985,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4089,"mean":4.0121731898239,"rank":2960,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":708,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4089,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124,"mean":3.862081300813,"rank":86,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":2},"mendeley":{"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jonotter\/status\/602488716104507393","license":"datasift","rt":["MicrobLog_me_uk"],"citation_ids":[4054059],"posted_on":"2015-05-24T14:57:58+00:00","author":{"name":"Jon Otter","url":"http:\/\/ReflectionsIPC.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/910147777178501120\/_H33jjUr_normal.jpg","description":"Infection Prevention & Control Epidemiologist, @ImperialNHS, @HPRUamr.
