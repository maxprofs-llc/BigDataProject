The canonical forward mode of the TCA cycle fuelled by glutamine may benefit from the decarboxylation of malate into pyruvate for fueling pyruvate dehydrogenase and generating acetyl-CoA to offer a self-sustainable TCA cycle. Under hypoxia and mutations in the TCA cycle, the reductive carboxylation of glutamine-derived \u03b1KG into citrate mainly supports lipogenesis via the ATP citrate lyase that cleaves citrate into oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA. Still, a largely unsuspected source of acetyl-CoA was shown to derive from the direct ligation of acetate to CoA by acetyl-CoA synthetases. Altogether, these findings identify critical metabolic nodes in the glutamine and acetate metabolism as new determinants of tumor metabolic plasticity that may facilitate the design of synthetic lethal treatments.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f61000706a","authors":["Corbet, Cyril","Feron, Olivier"],"doi":"10.1097\/mco.0000000000000178","first_seen_on":"2015-05-24T10:11:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1473-6519","1363-1950"],"issue":"4","journal":"Current Opinion in Clinical Nutrition and Metabolic Care","last_mentioned_on":1461331903,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26001655?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-clinicalnutrition\/Abstract\/2015\/07000\/Metabolic_and_mind_shifts___from_glucose_to.6.aspx","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1097\/MCO.0000000000000178"],"pmid":"26001655","pubdate":"2015-05-24T22:01:08+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["metabolism","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Metabolic and mind shifts: from glucose to glutamine and acetate addictions in cancer","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metabolic-mind-shifts"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7588328,"mean":6.5418890751503,"rank":1533374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6043679,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7588328,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":217012,"mean":8.3845263327667,"rank":55124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":161402,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":217012,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":836,"mean":6.9571401197605,"rank":214,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":619,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":836,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":2.3477272727273,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
