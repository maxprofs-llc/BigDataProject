This may have formed an imprecise picture of brain processes underpinning sustained tactile attention. In the present study, we simultaneously recorded EEG-fMRI and used modulations of steady-state somatosensory evoked potentials (SSSEPs) as a measure of attentional trial-by-trial variability. Therefore, frequency-tagged streams of vibrotactile stimulations were simultaneously presented to both index fingers. Human participants were cued to sustain attention to either the left or right finger stimulation and to press a button whenever they perceived a target pulse embedded in the to-be-attended stream. In-line with previous studies, a classical general linear model (GLM) analysis based on cued attention conditions revealed increased activity mainly in somatosensory and cerebellar regions. Yet, parametric modeling of the BOLD response using simultaneously recorded SSSEPs as a marker of attentional trial-by-trial variability quarried the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). The IPS in turn showed enhanced functional connectivity to a modality-unspecific attention network. However, this was only revealed on the basis of cued attention conditions in the classical GLM. By considering attentional variability as captured by SSSEPs, the IPS showed increased connectivity to a sensorimotor network, underpinning attentional selection processes between competing tactile stimuli and action choices (press a button or not). Thus, the current findings highlight the potential value by considering attentional variations in single trials and extend previous knowledge on the role of the IPS in tactile attention.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e79","authors":["Goltz, Dominique","Gundlach, Christopher","Nierhaus, Till","Villringer, Arno","M\u00fcller, Matthias","Pleger, Burkhard"],"doi":"10.1523\/jneurosci.3421-14.2015","first_seen_on":"2015-05-23T21:13:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1529-2401"],"issue":"20","journal":"Journal of Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1432415553,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25995478?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25995478","pubdate":"2015-05-23T22:05:40+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Connections between Intraparietal Sulcus and a Sensorimotor Network Underpin Sustained Tactile Attention.","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/connections-between-intraparietal-sulcus-sensorimotor-network-underpin-sustained-tactile-attention"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5133432,"mean":6.0721600422813,"rank":2710695,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1752780,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5133432,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172636,"mean":8.9474471688824,"rank":98137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":57471,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172636,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10531,"mean":8.1600178537512,"rank":6717,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":1781,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10531,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":330,"mean":11.782103343465,"rank":273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":330,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
