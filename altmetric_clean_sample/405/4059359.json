Outside the chorion are follicle cells, which may affect the buoyancy of eggs. Inside the chorion are test cells, which during oogenesis provision the egg and which after fertilisation contribute to the larval tunic. The structure of maternal cells may vary between species. The model ascidian Ciona intestinalis has been recently split into two species, currently named type A and type B. The ultrastructure of extraembryonic cells and structures from type A embryos has been reported. Here we describe the ultrastructure of follicle and test cells from C. intestinalis type B embryos. Test cells are about 5 \u00b5m in diameter and line the inside of the chorion of developing embryos in a dense sheet. Follicle cells are large (> 100 \u00b5m long) and spike-shaped, with many large vesicles. Terminal electron dense granules are found towards the tips of spikes, adjacent to cytoplasm containing numerous small electron dense bodies connected by filaments. These are probably vesicles containing material for the terminal granules. Removal of maternal structures and cells just after fertilisation, as commonly used in many experiments manipulating C. intestinalis development, has been reported to affect embryonic patterning. We examined the impact of this on embryonic ectoderm cells by scanning electron microscopy. Cells of embryos that developed without maternal structures still developed cilia, but had indistinct cell boundaries and a more flattened appearance than those that developed within the chorion.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f610003761","authors":["Thompson, Helen","Shimeld, Sebastian M"],"doi":"10.2108\/zs140231","first_seen_on":"2015-05-26T15:56:08+00:00","funders":["niehs","bbsrc"],"issns":["0289-0003"],"issue":"3","journal":"Zoological Science (VSP International Science Publishers)","last_mentioned_on":1433172852,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26003975?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.bioone.org\/doi\/full\/10.2108\/zs140231","http:\/\/www.bioone.org\/doi\/abs\/10.2108\/zs140231?utm_content=bufferb70d6&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer&"],"pmid":"26003975","pubdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Transmission and Scanning Electron Microscopy of the Accessory Cells and Chorion During Development of Ciona intestinalis Type B Embryos and the Impact of Their Removal on Cell Morphology","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transmission-scanning-electron-microscopy-accessory-cells-chorion-during-development-ciona-intestina"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5174102,"mean":6.1057314111209,"rank":1978337,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3153991,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5174102,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172926,"mean":8.8883971895332,"rank":64122,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":107040,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172926,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":442,"mean":3.0459319727891,"rank":178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":261,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":442,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.375,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Physics and Astronomy":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2,"Environmental Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/wjackman\/status\/604312890410209280","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4059359],"posted_on":"2015-05-29T15:46:35+00:00","author":{"name":"William Jackman","url":"http:\/\/www.bowdoin.edu\/faculty\/w\/wjackman\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/710460668323868672\/NAB29Rx5_normal.jpg","description":"Embryology & Evolution","id_on_source":"wjackman","tweeter_id":"30682168","geo":{"lt":39.00573,"ln":-122.00941,"country":"US"},"followers":46},"tweet_id":"604312890410209280"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BioOneNews\/status\/605396936947081217","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4059359],"posted_on":"2015-06-01T15:34:12+00:00","author":{"name":"BioOne","url":"http:\/\/bioonepublishing.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/899632542671917056\/ahx8jIT4_normal.jpg","description":"BioOne is a nonprofit publisher committed to making research more accessible.
