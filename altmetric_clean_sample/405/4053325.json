TLRs are signaling receptors involved in the recognition of microorganisms, and polymorphisms in their genes may influence the innate and adaptive immune response to H. pylori, affecting the clinical outcomes of the infection. We assessed the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms in TLR9 and TLR5 and gastroduodenal diseases. All patients were genotyped by allelic discrimination in regions 1174C\u2009>\u2009T and 1775A\u2009>\u2009G of TLR5 and -1237T\u2009>\u2009C and 2848G\u2009>\u2009A of TLR9. The 2848A allele of TLR9 was more frequent in duodenal ulcer and showed an association of risk with this pathology. Polymorphisms in TLR5 were not found to be associated with disease. Patients with polymorphisms in TLR9 and TLR5 expressed significantly lower levels of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, whereas polymorphisms in TLR5 also decreased the expression of IL-6 and IL-10. Our findings suggest that 2848G\u2009>\u2009A polymorphism in TLR9 increases the risk for the development of duodenal ulcer probably by modifying the inflammatory response to H. pylori infection. This is the first study to show an association of 2848A allele of TLR9 with duodenal ulcer and with altered expression of inflammatory cytokines in the gastric mucosa.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d79","authors":["Trejo-de la O, Alejandra","Torres, Javier","S\u00e1nchez-Zauco, Norma","P\u00e9rez-Rodr\u00edguez, Martha","Camorlinga-Ponce, Margarita","Flores-Luna, Lourdes","Lazcano-Ponce, Eduardo","Maldonado-Bernal, Carmen"],"doi":"10.1177\/1753425915587130","first_seen_on":"2015-05-24T02:59:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1753-4267"],"journal":"Journal of Endotoxin Research","last_mentioned_on":1466503414,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25995217?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25995217","pubdate":"2015-05-24T22:04:30+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["bacteriology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Polymorphisms in TLR9 but not in TLR5 increase the risk for duodenal ulcer and alter cytokine expression in the gastric mucosa.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/polymorphisms-tlr9-not-tlr5-increase-risk-duodenal-ulcer-alter-cytokine-expression-gastric-mucosa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7926939,"mean":6.7044594278339,"rank":6861758,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7926939,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":218726,"mean":8.4746337821466,"rank":184681,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":218726,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":221,"mean":1.1733909090909,"rank":123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":221,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.53571428571429,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"CO":1,"MX":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Immunol_papers\/status\/602307826556342272","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4053325],"posted_on":"2015-05-24T02:59:10+00:00","author":{"name":"ImmunologyPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507527250015576065\/AHPc4B-C_normal.png","description":"A TwitterBot for #Immunology papers on #PubMed searching for adaptive, innate and cyto\/chemokine.
