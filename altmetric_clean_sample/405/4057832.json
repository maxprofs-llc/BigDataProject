Postcards were used to invite members to each meeting.\nNo ill effects resulted from the use of postcards and they served as a valued way to recognize individuals within the group.\nThis use of postcards proved therapeutic in unexpected ways and was very well accepted.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51d3cf058f610003973","authors":["Anna Treloar"],"doi":"10.1177\/1039856215584515","endpage":"276","first_seen_on":"2015-05-26T07:37:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1440-1665"],"issue":"3","journal":"Australasian Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1432625819,"links":["http:\/\/apy.sagepub.com\/content\/23\/3\/274.abstract?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/apy.sagepub.com\/content\/23\/3\/274.full.pdf","pmid":"25944763","pubdate":"2015-05-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"274","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"The therapeutic use of postcards in a mental health support group","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/therapeutic-postcards-mental-health-support-group"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5148574,"mean":6.0866090235122,"rank":3615334,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":867354,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5148574,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172562,"mean":8.8854496786645,"rank":123124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":30624,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172562,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":661,"mean":2.5770818181818,"rank":266,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":220,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":661,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":7.3464285714286,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":3}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"The therapeutic use of postcards in a mental health support group","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=853798888023830&id=450103581726698","license":"public","citation_ids":[4057832],"posted_on":"2015-05-26T07:36:58+00:00","summary":"\u00a0","author":{"name":"Psychiatry - Updates by Dr Thiha Swe","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/450103581726698","facebook_wall_name":"Psychiatry - Updates by Dr Thiha Swe","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/450103581726698\/picture","id_on_source":"450103581726698"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ThihaSwe_dr\/status\/603102513886175233","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4057832],"posted_on":"2015-05-26T07:36:59+00:00","author":{"name":"Psychiatry Updates","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/PsychiatryUpdates.by.DrThihaSwe","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3471096253\/6b7bd3fc313986902cd1574474364bae_normal.jpeg","description":"[RSS Updates from Psychiatry Journals globally, plus some mental health related news] \/ Should follow only if you are interested in Mental Health","id_on_source":"ThihaSwe_dr","tweeter_id":"1259166031","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":974},"tweet_id":"603102513886175233"}]}}
