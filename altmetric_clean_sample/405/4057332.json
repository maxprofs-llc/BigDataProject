(\u00a3)"],"citation":{"abstract":"We evaluated the diagnostic value of static and dynamic O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine ((18)F-FET) PET parameters in patients with progressive or recurrent glioma.\nWe retrospectively analyzed 132 dynamic (18)F-FET PET and conventional MRI scans of 124 glioma patients (primary World Health Organization grade II, n = 55; grade III, n = 19; grade IV, n = 50; mean age, 52 \u00b1 14 y). Patients had been referred for PET assessment with clinical signs and\/or MRI findings suggestive of tumor progression or recurrence based on Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria. Maximum and mean tumor\/brain ratios of (18)F-FET uptake were determined (20-40 min post-injection) as well as tracer uptake kinetics (ie, time to peak and patterns of the time-activity curves). Diagnoses were confirmed histologically (95%) or by clinical follow-up (5%). Diagnostic accuracies of PET and MR parameters for the detection of tumor progression or recurrence were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic analyses\/chi-square test.\nTumor progression or recurrence could be diagnosed in 121 of 132 cases (92%). MRI and (18)F-FET PET findings were concordant in 84% and discordant in 16%. Compared with the diagnostic accuracy of conventional MRI to diagnose tumor progression or recurrence (85%), a higher accuracy (93%) was achieved by (18)F-FET PET when a mean tumor\/brain ratio \u22652.0 or time to peak <45 min was present (sensitivity, 93%; specificity, 100%; accuracy, 93%; positive predictive value, 100%; P < .001).\nStatic and dynamic (18)F-FET PET parameters differentiate progressive or recurrent glioma from treatment-related nonneoplastic changes with higher accuracy than conventional MRI.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f61000828a","authors":["Norbert Galldiks","Gabriele Stoffels","Christian Filss","Marion Rapp","Tobias Blau","Caroline Tscherpel","Garry Ceccon","Veronika Dunkl","Martin Weinzierl","Michael Stoffel","Michael Sabel","Gereon R.
