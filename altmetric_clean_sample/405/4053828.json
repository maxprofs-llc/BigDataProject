All of the PR interval variables were longer in the poAF cohort. Two variants on 1q21 and 12 on 4q25 were associated with poAF after adjustment for false discovery rate (FDR), but no variants were associated with PR interval variables after adjustment for FDR. Several variants were associated with both poAF and PR interval variables at p<0.05, but none of them remained significant after adjusting for FDR.\nIt was found that patients with poAF have significantly longer PR interval. Genetic variants in both the 1q21 and 4q25 regions associate with poAF after CABG surgery, but the authors were unable to find association between these variants and PR interval after adjusting for FDR.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bb4","authors":["Sigurdsson, Martin I","Muehlschlegel, Jochen D","Fox, Amanda A","Heydarpour, Mahyar","Lichtner, Peter","Meitinger, Thomas","Collard, Charles D","Shernan, Stanton K","Body, Simon C"],"doi":"10.1053\/j.jvca.2014.10.028","first_seen_on":"2015-05-24T11:08:40+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["1053-0770","1532-8422"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia","last_mentioned_on":1456919893,"links":["http:\/\/www.jcvaonline.com\/article\/S1053-0770(14)00536-9\/abstract?rss=yes","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26009287?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26009287?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jcvaonline.com\/article\/S1053077014005369\/pdf","pmid":"26009287","pubdate":"2015-01-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["anesthesiology","cardiology","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Genetic Variants Associated With Atrial Fibrillation and PR Interval Following Cardiac Surgery.","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genetic-variants-associated-atrial-fibrillation-pr-interval-following-cardiac-surgery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7342039,"mean":6.3783632029643,"rank":2901079,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4400949,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7342039,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":214764,"mean":8.3438846076839,"rank":78020,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":135027,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":214764,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":916,"mean":0.7899956284153,"rank":77,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":838,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":916,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.45454545454545,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
