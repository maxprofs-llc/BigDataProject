The IH score was used to assess correlations between synovial SDF-1 or CXCR4 and the disease activity score (DAS28 CRP), Rooney score, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6 (IL-6), CD4, CD20, CD68 and the Assessment of RA by Scoring of Large-Joint Destruction and Healing in Radiographic Imaging (ARASHI) score. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to predict ARASHI scores from the CXCR4 IH scores.\nSDF-1 was strongly correlated with the DAS28 CRP and serum IL-6. CXCR4 was correlated with synovial CD4 and the ARASHI score. ROC analysis of CXCR4 and ARASHI scores >10 indicated a cutoff of 12 points on the IH score for predicting joint destruction during treatment.\nSynovial SDF-1 was correlated with disease activity, and its receptor CXCR4 was related to joint destruction in RA patients treated with golimumab.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f61000310a","authors":["Kanbe, Katsuaki","Chiba, Junji","Inoue, Yasuo","Taguchi, Masashi","Yabuki, Akiko"],"doi":"10.3109\/14397595.2015.1054088","first_seen_on":"2015-05-23T15:31:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1439-7609"],"journal":"Modern Rheumatology","last_mentioned_on":1432395012,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25995033?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25995033","pubdate":"2015-05-23T22:06:09+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"SDF-1 and CXCR4 in synovium are associated with disease activity and bone and joint destruction in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with golimumab.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sdf1-cxcr4-synovium-associated-disease-activity-bone-joint-destruction-patients-rheumatoid-arthritis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5133091,"mean":6.0724638925106,"rank":4268961,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5133091,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172636,"mean":8.9474897442582,"rank":142268,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172636,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":220,"mean":1.2103196347032,"rank":152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":220,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.3125,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
