This lamellar crystal of phosphorus atoms can be exfoliated down to monolayer 2D-phosphane (also called phosphorene) using procedures similar to those used for graphene. Probing the properties has, however, been challenged by a fast degradation of the thinnest layers on exposure to ambient conditions. Herein, we investigate this chemistry using in situ Raman and transmission electron spectroscopies. The results highlight a thickness-dependent photoassisted oxidation reaction with oxygen dissolved in adsorbed water. The oxidation kinetics is consistent with a phenomenological model involving electron transfer and quantum confinement as key parameters. A procedure carried out in a glove box is used to prepare mono-, bi- and multilayer 2D-phosphane in their pristine states for further studies on the effect of layer thickness on the Raman modes. Controlled experiments in ambient conditions are shown to lower the Ag(1)\/Ag(2) intensity ratio for ultrathin layers, a signature of oxidation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000426b","authors":["Alexandre Favron","Alexandre Favron","Etienne Gaufr\u00e8s","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Fossard","Anne-Laurence Phaneuf-L\u2019Heureux","Nathalie Y-W.
