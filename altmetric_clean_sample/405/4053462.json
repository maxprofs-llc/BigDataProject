Given this figure, service-delivery organizations are under pressure to ensure staff are well-prepared to deliver services through the provision of training. Providing effective staff training and performance management is also necessary for the delivery of evidence-based practice and is an ethical obligation for Behavior Analyst Certification Board\u00ae, Inc. (BACB\u00ae) certificants. The purpose of the present study was to document the various types of staff and supervisory training and performance management procedures offered to BACB\u00ae certificants and aspirants working in applied settings.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81e3cf058f61000bbd8","authors":["Florence D.
