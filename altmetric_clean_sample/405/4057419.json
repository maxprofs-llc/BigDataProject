A total of 50 freshmen not receiving any training in meditation intervention were randomly divided into the meditation group (25 subjects) and the control group (25 subjects). The meditation group was implemented with group meditation intervention for 4 weeks, three times a week, about 30 minutes each time. The results revealed that the effect sizes in interpersonal interaction and complex understanding of others in the meditation group were both above 0.8, indicating strong effects. It was concluded that loving-kindness meditation can effectively improve positive emotions, interpersonal interactions, and complex understanding of others in college students.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f6100082a9","authors":["Wendian Shi","Xiaoli Wang","Xiangxiang Han","Ni Zhang","Xiaoli He","Nana Wang"],"doi":"10.2147\/ndt.s79607","first_seen_on":"2015-05-26T01:59:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1176-6328"],"journal":"Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1439811310,"links":["http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/the-interventional-effects-of-loving-kindness-meditation-on-positive-e-peer-reviewed-article-NDT","http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/articles.php?article_id=21873","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4450657\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.2147\/NDT.S79607"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=25182","pmid":"26060402","pubdate":"2015-06-11T22:02:11+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"title":"The interventional effects of loving-kindness meditation on positive emotions and interpersonal interactions","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interventional-effects-lovingkindness-meditation-positive-emotions-interpersonal-interactions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5492745,"mean":6.376680732254,"rank":2053334,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":3419790,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5492745,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180124,"mean":8.90117078885,"rank":64004,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":115006,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180124,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1179,"mean":4.6480950764007,"rank":371,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":769,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1179,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":3.7307843137255,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
