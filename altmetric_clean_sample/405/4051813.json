The past few decades have witnessed great progress in colloidal synthesis of monodisperse metal nanoparticles with defined shapes. This has significantly fueled up the research of directing the metal nanoparticles to self-assemble into tailored extended structures, especially low dimensional ones, for a better control and manipulation of the interactions of the metal nanoparticles with light. In parallel, theories for a better description of nanoplasmonics have been increasingly developed and improved. Thus, the present review is focused on the overview of current experimental and theoretical developments in the directed self-assembly of metal nanoparticles with tailored plasmonic properties, which, hopefully, will provide useful guidelines for future research studies and applications of nanoplasmonics.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6383cf058f61000898b","authors":["Xi, Chunxiao","Marina, Paula Facal","Xia, Haibing","Wang, Dayang","Chunxiao Xi","Paula Facal Marina","Haibing Xia","Dayang Wang"],"doi":"10.1039\/c5sm00900f","endpage":"4571","first_seen_on":"2015-05-23T10:43:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handle":"11541.2\/111452","handles":["11541.2\/111452"],"issns":["1744-6848","1744-683X"],"issue":"23","journal":"Soft Matter","last_mentioned_on":1432377789,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25994925?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1039\/c5sm00900f"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2015\/sm\/c5sm00900f","pmid":"25994925","pubdate":"2015-05-23T22:06:14+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"4562","title":"Directed self-assembly of gold nanoparticles into plasmonic chains.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/xlink.rsc.org\/?DOI=C5SM00900F","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/directed-selfassembly-gold-nanoparticles-plasmonic-chains-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7047871,"mean":6.2652690756186,"rank":5278131,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":990157,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7047871,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":213458,"mean":8.3104477060955,"rank":149594,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":34140,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":213458,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2036,"mean":2.1902515970516,"rank":1141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":427,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2036,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":1.2875,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
