HLTF has a novel DNA-binding domain termed HIRAN that has been recently found in various proteins, although its detailed function remains unclear. In this study, the HIRAN domain of human HLTF was successfully crystallized. The crystals belonged to space group P41212 or P43212, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 130.0, c = 150.1\u2005\u00c5.","authors":["Ikegaya, Y."],"doi":"10.1107\/s2053230x15005907","first_seen_on":"2015-05-23T00:01:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2053-230X"],"issue":"6","journal":"Acta Crystallographica Section F Structural Biology Communications","last_mentioned_on":1432339206,"links":["http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?S2053230X15005907="],"pmid":"26057792","pubdate":"2015-05-20T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Crystallographic study of a novel DNA-binding domain of human HLTF involved in the template-switching pathway to avoid the replication arrest caused by DNA damage","type":"article","volume":"71","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/crystallographic-study-novel-dnabinding-domain-human-hltf-involved-templateswitching-pathway-avoid-r"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
