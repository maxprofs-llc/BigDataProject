In this review, we contextualize pivotal developments in our understanding and management of cardiac transplant immunology, histopathology, rejection surveillance, drug development and surgery. We also discuss current limitations in their application and the impact of the left ventricular assist devices in bridging this gap.","authors":["Dhssraj  Singh","David O.
