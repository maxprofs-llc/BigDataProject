Surgical success was defined as complete when the intraocular pressure (IOP) was \u22655 and \u226421 mm Hg with no additional antiglaucoma medication (AGM) or surgery and as qualified if IOP was controlled with AGM.\nThe median age (interquartile range) of subjects at the time of trabeculectomy was 41 years (37, 44 y) and the median follow-up period was 23 months (7, 79 mo). Postoperatively, the median IOP significantly reduced from 36 (26, 43) to 14 mm Hg (12, 17 mm Hg) (P<0.001) and median number of AGMs reduced from 3 (2, 4) to 0 (0, 0) (P<0.001). The percentage of complete success was 75% at 6 months, 64% at 12 months, 57% at 36 months, and 33% at 60 months. The percentage of qualified success was 94% at 6 months, 82% at 12 months, 71% at 36 months, and 60% at 60 months. Five eyes failed during the follow-up period. The mean (\u00b1SD) number of glaucoma surgeries per eye was 1.3\u00b10.5. Eight eyes developed corneal edema at a median follow-up of 78.5 months and 4 eyes underwent keratoplasty.\nPrimary trabeculectomy with MMC offers moderate surgical success in patients with ICE syndrome. Maintaining long-term IOP control and corneal clarity in these eyes is a big challenge.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007ca9","authors":["Chandran, Premanand","Rao, Harsha L","Mandal, Anil K","Choudhari, Nikhil S","Garudadri, Chandra S","Senthil, Sirisha","Rao, Harsha L.","Mandal, Anil K.","Choudhari, Nikhil S.","Garudadri, Chandra S."],"doi":"10.1097\/ijg.0000000000000268","first_seen_on":"2015-05-23T05:50:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1536-481X","1057-0829"],"issue":"7","journal":"Journal of Glaucoma","last_mentioned_on":1469121547,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/glaucomajournal\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Outcomes_of_Primary_Trabeculectomy_With.99119.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/glaucomajournal\/Abstract\/2016\/07000\/Outcomes_of_Primary_Trabeculectomy_With.17.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/glaucomajournal\/9000\/00000\/Outcomes_of_Primary_Trabeculectomy_With.99119.pdf","pmid":"25943731","pubdate":"2015-05-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Outcomes of Primary Trabeculectomy With Mitomycin-C in Glaucoma Secondary to Iridocorneal Endothelial Syndrome.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/glaucomajournal\/Fulltext\/2016\/07000\/Outcomes_of_Primary_Trabeculectomy_With.17.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/outcomes-primary-trabeculectomy-mitomycinc-glaucoma-secondary-iridocorneal-endothelial-syndrome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8088508,"mean":6.8823654995833,"rank":6142925,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1085645,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8088508,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":219774,"mean":8.6025276717341,"rank":155051,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":34185,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":219774,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1356,"mean":1.6261077490775,"rank":814,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":371,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1356,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":1.1056818181818,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Other":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JOGJournal\/status\/601988349616754688","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4050976],"posted_on":"2015-05-23T05:49:41+00:00","author":{"name":"Journal of Glaucoma","url":"http:\/\/www.glaucomajournal.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1376189460\/JOGcover_normal.jpg","description":"JOG provides a stimulating forum for discussion of clinical, scientific, and socioeconomic issues of concern to clinicians who care for glaucoma patients.","id_on_source":"JOGJournal","tweeter_id":"308497783","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":479},"tweet_id":"601988349616754688"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JOGJournal\/statuses\/752376850429583360","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4050976],"posted_on":"2016-07-11T05:39:54+00:00","author":{"name":"Journal of Glaucoma","url":"http:\/\/www.glaucomajournal.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1376189460\/JOGcover_normal.jpg","description":"JOG provides a stimulating forum for discussion of clinical, scientific, and socioeconomic issues of concern to clinicians who care for glaucoma patients.","id_on_source":"JOGJournal","tweeter_id":"308497783","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":479},"tweet_id":"752376850429583360"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JOGJournal\/statuses\/756176692834480128","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4050976],"posted_on":"2016-07-21T17:19:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Journal of Glaucoma","url":"http:\/\/www.glaucomajournal.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1376189460\/JOGcover_normal.jpg","description":"JOG provides a stimulating forum for discussion of clinical, scientific, and socioeconomic issues of concern to clinicians who care for glaucoma patients.","id_on_source":"JOGJournal","tweeter_id":"308497783","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":479},"tweet_id":"756176692834480128"}]}}
