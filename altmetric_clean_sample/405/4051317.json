The search terms were 'probiotic' AND 'NAFLD', 'prebiotic' AND 'NAFLD', 'antibiotic' AND 'NAFLD', 'probiotics' AND 'obesity', 'prebiotic' AND 'obesity' or 'antibiotic' AND 'obesity'; these terms were searched as text word in 'clinical trials' and as exploded medical subject headings where possible.\nThe evidence in the literature is scant, due to the scarcity of appropriately powered, randomized, controlled clinical trials, involving various centers and population of different origin.\nAlthough probiotics and prebiotics have been proposed in the treatment and prevention of patients with obesity-related NAFLD, their therapeutic use is not supported by high-quality clinical studies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f6100074e1","authors":["Tarantino, Giovanni","Finelli, Carmine","Giovanni Tarantino","Carmine Finelli"],"doi":"10.2217\/fmb.15.13","endpage":"902","first_seen_on":"2015-05-23T10:07:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1746-0921","1746-0913"],"issue":"5","journal":"Future Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1488232739,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26000656?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.2217\/fmb.15.13"],"pmid":"26000656","pubdate":"2015-05-23T22:00:28+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"889","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Systematic review on intervention with prebiotics\/probiotics in patients with obesity-related nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/systematic-review-intervention-prebioticsprobiotics-patients-obesityrelated-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8282830,"mean":6.9841686085689,"rank":3483062,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4747156,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8282830,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":220926,"mean":8.6448398687338,"rank":83518,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":134779,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":220926,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":589,"mean":3.317693877551,"rank":220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":367,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":589,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":4.1592,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
