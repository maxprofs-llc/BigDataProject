These reasons include cognitive impairment and motor dysfunction, personality changes, and knowledge of possible genetic transmission of the disease to their children. Thus, the decision to take a genetic test for individuals at risk for HD is often associated with family planning and relationship stress. However, for most individuals, a positive genetic test does not alter family planning with regard to their decision to have children. HD has also been associated with abnormal sexual behaviors, although only a few studies have explored sexuality and sexual dysfunction in HD. Up to 85% of men and 75% of women experience sexual problems, including hypoactive sexual disorder in some cases and increased sexual interest and paraphilia in others. Psychologic support should involve the communication of realistic expectations about the progression of the disorder and potential consequences on the children.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9163cf058f61000cfad","authors":["Reininghaus, Eva","Lackner, Nina"],"doi":"10.1016\/b978-0-444-63247-0.00018-3","first_seen_on":"2015-05-25T10:41:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0072-9752","00729752"],"journal":"Handbook of clinical neurology","last_mentioned_on":1440239283,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26003252?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/B9780444632470000183"],"pmid":"26003252","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Chapter 18 Relationship satisfaction and sexuality in Huntington's disease ","type":"article","volume":"130","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/relationship-satisfaction-sexuality-huntingtons-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5571003,"mean":6.3320664982719,"rank":3707805,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1633023,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5571003,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180515,"mean":8.894960346566,"rank":119920,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":51993,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180515,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":471,"mean":1.6226765957447,"rank":230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":222,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":471,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":2.1,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
