In response to oxygen-level in tissues, adenosine plasma-concentration is regulated in particular via its synthesis by CD73 and via its degradation by adenosine-deaminase (ADA). The cell-surface endopeptidase CD26 controls the concentration of vasoactive- and antioxidant-peptides, and hence regulates the oxygen-supply to tissues and oxidative-stress response. While overexpression of adenosine, CD73, ADA, A2AR and CD26 in response to hypoxia is well documented, the effects of hyperoxic and hyperbaric conditions on these elements deserve further consideration. Rats and a murine CHEM3 cell-line which expresses A2AR were exposed to: 0.21 bar O2, 0.79 bar N2 (Terrestrial conditions; normoxia); 1 bar O2 (Hyperoxia); 2 bar O2 (Hyperbaric hyperoxia); 0.21 bar O2, 1.79 bar N2 (Hyperbaria). Adenosine-plasma concentration, CD73, ADA, A2AR-expression and CD26-activity were addressed in-vivo and cAMP-production in-cellulo. In-vivo: i) hyperoxia decreased adenosine-plasma level and T-cell surface CD26-activity whereas it increased CD73-expression and ADA-level; ii) hyperbaric hyperoxia tended to amplify the trend; iii) hyperbaria alone lacked significant influence on these parameters. In the brain and in-cellulo: i) hyperoxia decreased A2AR-expression; ii) hyperbaric hyperoxia amplified the trend; iii) hyperbaria alone exhibited the strongest effect. We found a similar pattern regarding both A2AR-mRNA synthesis in the brain and cAMP-production in CHEM3-cells. Thus, high oxygen-level tended to down-regulate the adenosinergic pathway and CD26-activity. Hyperbaria alone affected only A2AR-expression and cAMP-production. We discuss how such mechanisms triggered by hyper-oxygenation can limit, through vasoconstriction, the oxygen-supply to tissues and the production of reactive oxygen species.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b71","authors":["Bruzzese, Laurie","Rostain, Jean-Claude","N\u00e9e, Laetitia","Condo, Jocelyne","Mottola, Giovanna","Adjriou, Nabil","Mercier, Laurence","Berg\u00e9-Lefranc, Jean-Louis","Fromonot, Julien","Kipson, Nathalie","Luciano, Michel","Durand-Gorde, Jos\u00e9e-Martine","Jammes, Yves","Guieu, R\u00e9gis","Ruf, Jean","Fenouillet, Emmanuel"],"doi":"10.1152\/japplphysiol.00223.2015","first_seen_on":"2015-05-23T17:48:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1522-1601","8750-7587"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Applied Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1460455911,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25997945?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25997945?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25997945","pubdate":"2015-05-23T22:03:15+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Effect of hyperoxic and hyperbaric conditions on the adenosinergic pathway and CD26-expression in rat.","type":"article","volume":"119","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-hyperoxic-hyperbaric-conditions-adenosinergic-pathway-cd26expression-rat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7540906,"mean":6.5135694142772,"rank":5707937,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1009108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7540906,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":216599,"mean":8.3817800903056,"rank":152497,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":33749,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":216599,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3309,"mean":9.5781293833132,"rank":2676,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3309,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":11.8105,"rank":54,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
