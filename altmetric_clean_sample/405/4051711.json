Three animals were sacrificed at postoperative weeks 6 and 12, respectively, and the remaining animals were sacrificed at postoperative week 24. Bilateral femoral heads were harvested and subjected to gross observation, histological examination using hematoxylin and eosin staining, and radiographic examination. Micro-computed tomography was performed on a portion of the specimens at postoperative week 24, and angiographic examination of the femoral head was performed before sacrificing the animals.\nEight ostriches developed a limp at postoperative week 8, with a mean duration of 16.5\u00a0weeks. The postoperative femoral head specimens showed changes in contour and articular cartilage degeneration. Sagittal sectioning of the collapsed femoral head specimens revealed distinct boundaries among the osteonecrotic areas, osteosclerotic areas, and normal trabeculae. Histological examinations revealed active bone resorption in the osteonecrotic area of the subchondral bone, an increased number of fat cells, and active trabecular bone regeneration in the osteosclerotic areas. The postoperative radiographic examinations revealed that the height of the femoral head gradually decreased and progressed to collapse. Micro-computed tomography scans showed the interrupted trabecular bone with an irregular shape in the collapsed femoral head. Compared with the normal samples, angiographic findings revealed interrupted blood supply of the cryo-injured samples in some areas of the femoral heads, blood vessel narrowing, and decreased number of blood vessels in the cryo-injured areas.\nThis study indicates that an animal model of osteonecrotic femoral head progressing to collapse can be established via a simplified method of cryosurgery. This model possesses histological features that are similar to those of humans; thus, it can be used as an ideal animal model for the study of femoral head necrosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000079b","authors":["Jiang, Wenxue","Wang, Pengfei","Wan, Yanlin","Xin, Dasen","Fan, Meng"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13018-015-0218-4","first_seen_on":"2015-05-23T10:27:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1749-799X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Research","last_mentioned_on":1460197866,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25994205?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25994205","pubdate":"2015-05-23T22:06:51+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Orthopedics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgical Orthopedics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"A simple method for establishing an ostrich model of femoral head osteonecrosis and collapse.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/simple-method-establishing-ostrich-model-femoral-head-osteonecrosis-collapse"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7523579,"mean":6.5040957411445,"rank":3883645,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2104669,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7523579,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":216509,"mean":8.3772433535945,"rank":117752,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":77112,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":216509,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":394,"mean":2.0451246819338,"rank":169,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":123,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":394,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":1.596358974359,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/OstrichPapers\/status\/602058154910687232","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4051711],"posted_on":"2015-05-23T10:27:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Ostrich Papers","url":"http:\/\/ostrichpapers.tumblr.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/587221215040897024\/ndavevak_normal.png","description":"RSS feed of new publications related to ostrich (Struthio camelus) research.
