Quality of included studies was analysed using the Modified Downs and Black form. The extent of, and effect of variation in treatment parameters such as anodal, cathodal and bi-hemispheric tDCS on upper extremity outcome measures of impairment and activity were analysed using meta-analysis.\nNine studies (371 participants with acute, sub-acute and chronic stroke) were included. Different methodologies of tDCS and upper extremity intervention, outcome measures and timing of assessments were identified. Real tDCS combined with rehabilitation had a small non-significant effect of +0.11 (p=0.44) and +0.24 (p=0.11) on upper extremity impairments and activities at post-intervention respectively.\nVarious tDCS methods have been used in stroke rehabilitation. The evidence so far is not statistically significant, but is suggestive of, at best, a small beneficial effect on upper extremity impairment.\nFuture research should focus on which patients and rehabilitation programmes are likely to respond to different tDCS regimes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002566","authors":["Tedesco Triccas, L","Burridge, J H","Hughes, A M","Pickering, R M","Desikan, M","Rothwell, J C","Verheyden, G","L.
