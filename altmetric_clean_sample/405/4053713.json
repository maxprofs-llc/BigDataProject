The aim of this study was to evaluate the concept of \"walking blood bank\" as a supportable plan for supplying safe blood and blood products.\nIn 2013, the Royal Norwegian Navy conducted antipiracy operations from a frigate, beginning in the Gulf of Aden and ending in the Indian Ocean. Crews were on 24-hour emergency alert in preparation for an enemy assault on the frigate. Under an approved command protocol, a \"walking blood bank,\" using crew blood donations, was established for use on board and on missions conducted in rigid-hulled inflatable boats, during which freeze-dried plasma and leukoreduced, group O low anti-A\/anti-B titer, cold-stored whole blood were stored in Golden Hour Boxes. Data demonstrating the ability to collect, store, and provide whole blood were collected to establish feasibility of implementing a whole blood-focused remote damage-control resuscitation program aboard a naval vessel. In addition, ROTEM data were collected to demonstrate feasibility of performing this analysis on a large naval vessel and to also measure hemostatic efficacy of cold-stored leukoreduced whole blood (CWB) stored during a period of 14 days. ROTEM data on CWB was compared with reconstituted whole blood.\nDrills simulating massive transfusion activation were conducted, in which 2 U of warm fresh whole blood with platelet sparing leukoreduction were produced in 40 minutes, followed by collection of two additional units at 15-minute increments. The ROTEM machine performed well during ship-rolling, as shown by the overlapping calculated and measured mechanical piston movements measured by the ROTEM device. Error messages were recorded in 4 (1.5%) of 267 tests. CWB yielded reproducible ROTEM results demonstrating preserved fibrinogen function and platelet function for at least 3.5 weeks and 2 weeks, respectively. The frequency of ROTEM tests were as follows: EXTEM (n = 88), INTEM (n = 85), FIBTEM (n = 82), and APTEM (n = 12). CWB results were grouped. Compared with Days 0 to 2, EXTEM maximum clot firmness was significantly reduced, beginning on Days 10 to 14; however, results through that date remained within reference ranges and were comparable with the EXTEM maximum clot firmness for the reconstituted whole blood samples containing Day 5 room temperature-stored platelets.\nA \"walking blood bank\" can provide a balanced transfusion product to support damage-control resuscitation\/remote damage-control resuscitation aboard a frigate in the absence of conventional blood bank products. ROTEM analysis is feasible to monitor damage-control resuscitation and blood product quality. ROTEM analysis was possible in challenging operational conditions.\nTherapeutic study, level V.","altmetric_jid":"5523eeb22a83ee005f8b4573","authors":["Strandenes, Geir","Austlid, Ivar","Apelseth, Torunn O","Hervig, Tor A","Sommerfelt-Pettersen, Jan","Herzig, Maryanne C","Cap, Andrew P","Pidcoke, Heather F","Kristoffersen, Einar K"],"doi":"10.1097\/ta.0000000000000628","first_seen_on":"2015-05-24T10:21:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2163-0763"],"issue":"6 Suppl 1 Remote Damage Control Resuscitation Symposium 6","journal":"Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery, The","last_mentioned_on":1439979675,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26002261?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26002261","pubdate":"2015-05-24T22:00:34+00:00","subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Coagulation function of stored whole blood is preserved for 14 days in austere conditions: A ROTEM feasibility study during a Norwegian antipiracy mission and comparison to equal ratio reconstituted blood.","type":"article","volume":"78","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/coagulation-function-stored-whole-blood-preserved-14-days-austere-conditions-rotem-feasibility-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5561997,"mean":6.327516145644,"rank":4637263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5561997,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180818,"mean":8.9381721187721,"rank":148562,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180818,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2178,"mean":5.5765613229215,"rank":1977,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2178,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109,"mean":8.5604814814815,"rank":91,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
