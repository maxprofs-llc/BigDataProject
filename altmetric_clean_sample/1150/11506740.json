Metabolic differences in biotransformation have been shown to extend to multiple drugs and may involve many steps in drug metabolism with alterations of key intermediates. Although metabolic differences have been reported to be associated with complications of medication use, it has only recently been appreciated that such differences also may be associated in the unborn with the potential for the disruption of normal embryologic development and the production of congenital malformations. It has long been suspected that the teratogenicity of phenytoin may be mediated not only by the parent compound, but also by toxic intermediary metabolites that are produced during the biotransformation of the parent compound. Recent work elucidating differences in isoenzyme forms of cytochrome P-450 enzyme systems, glutathione, and microsomal epoxide hydrolase has provided increased interest in the multiple individual pharmacogenetic differences that may be significant factors affecting increased susceptibility to birth defects in individuals and families with fetal exposure to phenytoin.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000588b","authors":["Van Dyke, D C","Berg, M J","Olson, C H"],"first_seen_on":"2016-09-03T03:28:49+00:00","issns":["1042-9611"],"issue":"9","journal":"DICP: The Annals of Pharmacotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1472859008,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1683079"],"pmid":"1683079","pubdate":"1991-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["pharmacy","pharmacology"],"title":"Differences in phenytoin biotransformation and susceptibility to congenital malformations: a review.","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/differences-phenytoin-biotransformation-susceptibility-congenital-malformations-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317445,"mean":7.0084957256017,"rank":7191407,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317445,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251971,"mean":12.464697924356,"rank":211035,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251971,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":3.544,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
