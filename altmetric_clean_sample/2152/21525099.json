Here we investigated how many loops and\/or dipoles are needed to approach the ultimate intrinsic SNR (UISNR) at various field strengths.\nWe calculated the UISNR inside dielectric cylinders mimicking different anatomical regions. We assessed the performance of various arrays with respect to the UISNR. We validated our results by comparing simulated and experimental coil performance maps.\nArrays with an increasing number of loops can rapidly approach the UISNR at fields up to 3 T, but are suboptimal at ultrahigh fields for body-size objects. The opposite is true for dipole arrays. At 7\u2009T and above, 16 dipoles provide considerably larger central SNR than any possible loop array, and minimal g factor penalty for parallel imaging.\nElectric dipoles can be advantageous at ultrahigh fields because they can produce both curl-free and divergence-free currents, whereas loops are limited to divergence-free contributions only. Combining loops and dipoles may be optimal for body imaging at 3\u2009T, whereas arrays of loops or dipoles alone may perform better at lower or higher field strengths, respectively.
