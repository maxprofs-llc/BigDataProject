EZH2 has been found to play pivotal roles in the development of various cancers. LncRNA-ANCR (anti-differentiation ncRNA) has been reported to interact with EZH2 and regulated osteoblast differentiation. Our study aimed to investigate the effect of lncRNA-ANCR on the tumorigenesis of osteosarcoma and explore the underlying molecular mechanism.\nRT-PCR was performed to detect the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of lncRNA-ANCR, EZH2, p21, and p27 in OS tissues and cell lines. The cell proliferation, transwell invasion, and migration assays were conducted to evaluate the influence of lncRNA-ANCR depletion on the growth of OS cells. RNA pull-down assay was carried out to detect the interaction between lncRNA-ANCR and EZH2. Correlation between the expression of lncRNA-ANCR and the expression of EZH2 were analyzed by cross-tabulation.\nLncRNA-ANCR is highly expressed in both OS tissues and cell lines. Reduced expression of lncRNA-ANCR inhibited the cell proliferation, invasion, and migration of OS cells. The cell apoptosis rate was also increased with the overexpression of lncRNA-ANCR. Mechanistically, downregulation of lncRNA-ANCR reduced the mRNA level of EZH2 and increased the expression of p21 and p27 at both mRNA and protein levels. LncRNA-ANCR interacted with EZH2 and their expression abundance was positively correlated in OS patients.\nLncRNA-ANCR inhibited the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of OS cells possibly through interacting with EZH2 and regulating the expression of p21 and p27.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000079b","authors":["Fei Zhang","Hao Peng","Fei Zhang","Hao Peng"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13018-017-0599-7","first_seen_on":"2017-07-05T15:23:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1749-799X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Research","last_mentioned_on":1499268943,"links":["https:\/\/josr-online.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s13018-017-0599-7"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/josr-online.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s13018-017-0599-7?site=josr-online.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"28679390","pubdate":"2017-07-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"103","subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"LncRNA-ANCR regulates the cell growth of osteosarcoma by interacting with EZH2 and affecting the expression of p21 and p27","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lncrnaancr-regulates-cell-growth-osteosarcoma-interacting-ezh2-affecting-expression-p21-p27"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8166903,"mean":6.9134132553505,"rank":4327856,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2267337,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8166903,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176398,"mean":11.578467751719,"rank":95644,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":63419,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176398,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":454,"mean":2.0620132450331,"rank":196,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":154,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":454,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":0.78888888888889,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MSKmedBMC\/statuses\/882620791279452160","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21529609],"posted_on":"2017-07-05T15:22:49+00:00","author":{"name":"MSKmedBMC","url":"https:\/\/josr-online.biomedcentral.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/719814662037094400\/y3nDEr8Z_normal.jpg","description":"A group of open access, peer-reviewed musculoskeletal journals, published by @BioMedCentral","id_on_source":"MSKmedBMC","tweeter_id":"719814313700102144","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":210},"tweet_id":"882620791279452160"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OncoBioMed\/statuses\/882624037779787776","license":"gnip","rt":["MSKmedBMC"],"citation_ids":[21529609],"posted_on":"2017-07-05T15:35:43+00:00","author":{"name":"Oncology Tweets","url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/723132260334088192\/j-e1tNle_normal.jpg","description":"Official twitter account of @BioMedCentral's #OpenAccess Cancer Research and Oncology journals.","id_on_source":"OncoBioMed","tweeter_id":"711861874229440512","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":247},"tweet_id":"882624037779787776"}]}}
