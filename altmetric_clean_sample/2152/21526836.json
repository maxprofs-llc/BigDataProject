However, clinical use is hampered by the lack of trimester-specific reference intervals. We therefore estimated reference intervals for copeptin and MR-proADM in disease-free Dutch women throughout pregnancy.\nApparently healthy low risk pregnant women were recruited. Exclusion criteria included current or past history of endocrine disease, multiple pregnancy, use of medication known to influence thyroid function and current pregnancy as a result of hormonal stimulation. Women who miscarried, developed hyperemesis gravidarum, hypertension, pre-eclampsia, hemolysis elevated liver enzymes and low platelets, diabetes or other disease, delivered prematurely or had a small for gestational age neonate were excluded from analyses. Blood samples were collected at 9-13 weeks (n=98), 27-29 weeks (n=94) and 36-39 weeks (n=91) of gestation and at 4-13 weeks post-partum (PP) (n=89). Sixty-two women had complete data during pregnancy and PP. All analyses were performed on a Kryptor compact plus.\nCopeptin increases during pregnancy, but 97.5th percentiles remain below the non-pregnant upper reference limit (URL) provided by the manufacturer. MR-proADM concentrations increase as well during pregnancy. In trimesters 2 and 3 the 97.5th percentiles are over three times the non-pregnant URL provided by the manufacturer.\nTrimester- and assay-specific reference intervals for copeptin and MR-proADM should be used. In addition, consecutive measurements and the time frame between measurements should be considered as the differences seen with or in advance of preeclampsia can be expected to be relatively small compared to the reference intervals.","authors":["Joosen, Annemiek M.C.P.","van der Linden, Ivon J.M.","Schrauwen, Lianne","Theeuwes, Alisia","de Groot, Monique J.M.","Ermens, Antonius A.M."],"doi":"10.1515\/cclm-2017-0110","first_seen_on":"2017-07-05T12:40:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1437-4331","1434-6621"],"journal":"Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine","last_mentioned_on":1499258434,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28672769?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28672769","pubdate":"2017-01-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Walter de Gruyter GmbH","subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques","chemistryclinical"],"title":"Reference intervals and longitudinal changes in copeptin and MR-proADM concentrations during pregnancy","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BlameOxytocin\/statuses\/882579959335616512","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21526836],"posted_on":"2017-07-05T12:40:34+00:00","author":{"name":"The Love Hormone","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/647614031289708544\/4CuoFMsx_normal.png","description":"RSS feed of oxytocin and vasopressin papers in PubMed.
