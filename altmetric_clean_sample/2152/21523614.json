Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the certainty in the body of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.\nAmong the 1932 articles identified, one RCT and four NRS were eligible. Very low certainty in the body of evidence across examined studies suggests that Vitamin D supplementation for pregnant women, breastfeeding women and infants may not decrease the risk of developing allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis (in pregnant women), allergic rhinitis (in pregnant women, and infants), asthma and\/or wheezing (in pregnant women, breastfeeding women, and infants), or food allergies (in pregnant women). We found no studies of primary prevention of allergic diseases in children.\nLimited information is available addressing primary prevention of allergic diseases after Vitamin D supplementation and its potential impact remains uncertain.
