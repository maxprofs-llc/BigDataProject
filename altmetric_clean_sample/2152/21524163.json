The number of patients is increasing worldwide and as yet there is no cure for the disease. The majority of existing treatments target motor symptom control. Over the last two decades the impact of the genetic contribution to PD has been appreciated. Significant discoveries have been made, which have advanced our understanding of the pathophysiological and molecular basis of PD. In this chapter we outline current knowledge of the clinical aspects of PD and the basic mechanistic understanding.","aggregated_in":[22144952],"authors":["Noyce, Alastair","Bandopadhyay, Rina","Alastair Noyce","Rina Bandopadhyay"],"book":{"title":"Neurodegenerative Diseases","isbns":["9783319571911","9783319571935"],"uri":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/book\/10.1007%2F978-3-319-57193-5"},"doi":"10.1007\/978-3-319-57193-5_3","first_seen_on":"2017-07-05T10:05:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2190-5215","2190-5223"],"journal":"Advances in neurobiology","last_mentioned_on":1499249105,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28674978?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/chapter\/10.1007\/978-3-319-57193-5_3"],"ordinal_number":3,"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2F978-3-319-57193-5_3.pdf","pmid":"28674978","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","title":"Parkinson\u2019s Disease: Basic Pathomechanisms and a Clinical Overview","type":"chapter","uri":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/chapter\/10.1007\/978-3-319-57193-5_3","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/parkinsons-disease-basic-pathomechanisms-clinical-overview"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NeuroGen_papers\/statuses\/882540829377679361","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21524163,22144952],"posted_on":"2017-07-05T10:05:05+00:00","author":{"name":"NeuroGenetics papers","url":"http:\/\/neurogeneticslab.wordpress.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/508573077727223808\/P7-OnZSA_normal.png","description":"Twitterbot from @TheGBLab!
