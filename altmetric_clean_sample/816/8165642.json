The morphology of the fish branchial skeleton is matched to a species' diet. Threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) have emerged as a model system to study the genetic and developmental basis of evolved differences in a variety of traits. Marine populations of sticklebacks have repeatedly colonized countless new freshwater lakes and creeks. Adaptation to the new diet in these freshwater environments likely underlies a series of craniofacial changes that have evolved repeatedly in independently derived freshwater populations. These include three major patterning changes to the branchial skeleton: reductions in the number and length of gill raker bones, increases in pharyngeal tooth number, and increased branchial bone lengths. Here we describe a detailed protocol to dissect and flat-mount the internal branchial skeleton in threespine stickleback fish. Dissection of the entire three-dimensional branchial skeleton and mounting it flat into a largely two-dimensional prep allows for the easy visualization and quantification of branchial skeleton morphology. This dissection method is inexpensive, fast, relatively easy, and applicable to a wide variety of fish species. In sticklebacks, this efficient method allows the quantification of skeletal morphology in genetic crosses to map genomic regions controlling craniofacial patterning.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f23","authors":["Ellis, Nicholas A","Miller, Craig T"],"doi":"10.3791\/54056","first_seen_on":"2016-05-24T14:11:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1940-087X"],"issue":"111","journal":"Journal of Visualized Experiments","last_mentioned_on":1464099066,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27213248?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27213248","pubdate":"2016-05-07T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques","biology"],"title":"Dissection and Flat-mounting of the Threespine Stickleback Branchial Skeleton","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dissection-flatmounting-threespine-stickleback-branchial-skeleton"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7747098,"mean":6.6307251234818,"rank":4022736,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2175864,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7747098,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268947,"mean":11.438139961181,"rank":145815,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":96766,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268947,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4095,"mean":3.2176414264778,"rank":1905,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":1808,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4095,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114,"mean":3.7470973451327,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
