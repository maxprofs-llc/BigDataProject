We here present a novel method, Feature sets-based Genome Mapping (FGM). With FGM, physical map and draft whole genome sequences can be generated, anchored and integrated using the same data set of NGS sequences, independent of restriction digestion. Method model was created and parameters were inspected by simulations using the Arabidopsis genome sequence. In the simulations, when ~4.8X genome BAC library including 4,096 clones was used to sequence the whole genome, ~90% of clones were successfully connected to physical contigs, and 91.58% of genome sequences were mapped and connected to chromosomes. This method was experimentally verified using the existing physical map and genome sequence of rice. Of 4,064 clones covering 115 Mb sequence selected from ~3 tiles of 3 chromosomes of a rice draft physical map, 3,364 clones were reconstructed into physical contigs and 98 Mb sequences were integrated into the 3 chromosomes. The physical map-integrated draft genome sequences can provide permanent frameworks for eventually obtaining high-quality reference sequences by targeted sequencing, gap filling and combining other sequences.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Yonglong Pan","Xiaoming Wang","Lin Liu","Hao Wang","Meizhong Luo","Pan, Yonglong","Wang, Xiaoming","Liu, Lin","Wang, Hao","Luo, Meizhong"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0161583","first_seen_on":"2016-09-09T23:45:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"9","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1473956041,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0161583&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27611682?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27611682?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27611682?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0161583.PDF","pmid":"27611682","pubdate":"2016-09-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0161583","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Whole Genome Mapping with Feature Sets from High-Throughput Sequencing Data","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/whole-genome-mapping-feature-sets-highthroughput-sequencing-data"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8386076,"mean":7.0651873001299,"rank":2045829,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6319247,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8386076,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252980,"mean":12.485798520825,"rank":80274,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":171606,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252980,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115742,"mean":10.633468572071,"rank":36501,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":78769,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115742,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4256,"mean":9.9368009400705,"rank":1392,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2839,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4256,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
