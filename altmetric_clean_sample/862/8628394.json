Estrogen deficiency usually causes systemic osteoporosis not only in long bones but also in jaw bones, and exogenous estrogen can enhance the osteogenic potential of mesenchymal stem cells. Dental mesenchymal stem cells (DMSCs) represent a group of stem cells isolated from different parts of the tooth, including dental pulps, apical papillae and periodontal ligaments. A number of studies have proved that estrogen plays an important role in the proliferation, differentiation and tissue regeneration of human DMSCs. Thus, this review will focus on the effects of estrogen on proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation of dental stem cells, discuss evidence from studies in rodents that estrogen plays an important role in dental morphogenesis as well as periodontal remodeling, and suggest directions for future studies in estrogen-related tooth regeneration.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61a3cf058f610007639","authors":["Lu, Yadie","Jin, Lin","Lei, Gang","Fu, Yujin","Wang, Yanqiu","Yu, Jinhua"],"doi":"10.14670\/hh-11-786","first_seen_on":"2016-06-10T08:04:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1699-5848"],"journal":"Histology and Histopathology","last_mentioned_on":1465593234,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27231017?platform=hootsuite"],"pmid":"27231017","pubdate":"2016-06-10T22:21:30+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["histology","pathology"],"title":"Estrogen-mediated dental tissue regeneration.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/estrogenmediated-dental-tissue-regeneration"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7879571,"mean":6.6725285125901,"rank":4129479,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2196831,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7879571,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268520,"mean":11.398470268398,"rank":145443,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":96568,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268520,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":335,"mean":2.0048323353293,"rank":121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":178,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":335,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.7166666666667,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"BA":1,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/flyerLPA\/statuses\/741165584902180864","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8628394],"posted_on":"2016-06-10T07:10:20+00:00","author":{"name":"H\u00e9ctor J.
