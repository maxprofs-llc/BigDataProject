Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is often the prodromal stage to AD. Most patients with aMCI harbor the pathologic changes of AD and demonstrate transition to AD at a rate of 10%-15% per year. Patients with AD and aMCI experience progressive brain metabolite changes. Accumulating evidence indicates that the asymmetry changes of left and right brain happen in the early stage of AD. However, the features of asymmetry changes in both anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG) and posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG) are still unclear. Here, we examine the left-right asymmetry changes of metabolites in ACG and PCG. Fifteen cases of mild AD patients meeting criteria for probable AD of NINDS-ADRDA, thirteen cases of aMCI according to the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research Center criteria, and sixteen cases of age-matched normal controls (NC) received Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) for measurement of NAA\/mI, NAA\/Cr, Cho\/Cr, and mI\/Cr ratios in the PCG and ACG bilaterally. We analyzed (1)H-MRS data by paired t-test to validate the left-right asymmetry of (1)H-MRS data in the PCG and ACG. In AD, there was a significant difference in mI\/Cr between the left and right ACG (P<0.001) and the left and right PCG (P=0.007). In aMCI, there was a significant difference in mI\/Cr between the left and right ACG (P<0.001). In NC, there were no differences in the ratio value of metabolites NAA\/mI, NAA\/Cr, Cho\/Cr, and mI\/Cr between the left and right ACG and PCG. Thus, the left-right asymmetry of mI\/Cr in the ACG and PCG may be an important biological indicator of mild AD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000582e","authors":["Zhongwei Guo","Xiaozheng Liu","Hongtao Hou","Fuquan Wei","Xingli Chen","Yuedi Shen","Wei Chen","Guo, Zhongwei","Liu, Xiaozheng","Hou, Hongtao","Wei, Fuquan","Chen, Xingli","Shen, Yuedi","Chen, Wei"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.comppsych.2016.06.001","endpage":"185","first_seen_on":"2016-06-09T22:32:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-8384","0010440X"],"journal":"Comprehensive Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1492518382,"links":["http:\/\/www.comppsychjournal.com\/article\/S0010-440X(16)30147-X\/abstract?rss=yes","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27423359?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27423359","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27423359?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.comppsychjournal.com\/article\/S0010440X1630147X\/pdf","pmid":"27423359","pubdate":"2016-07-18T20:13:41+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"179","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"1H-MRS asymmetry changes in the anterior and posterior cingulate gyrus in patients with mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer's disease","type":"article","volume":"69","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/1hmrs-asymmetry-changes-anterior-posterior-cingulate-gyrus-patients-mild-cognitive-impairment-mild-a"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.5,"score_history":{"1y":9.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082745,"mean":6.8630429413494,"rank":865293,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7205630,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082745,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270306,"mean":11.493097079225,"rank":41699,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":227783,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270306,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1238,"mean":3.1250703314471,"rank":73,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":1164,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1238,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":1.6795918367347,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":98}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
