The levels of the human defensin \u03b2-2 (hBD2) and \u03b1-defensins (HNP 1-3) in the sera and in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the patients and the controls were determined. Higher copy numbers of the DEFB4 gene was observed in AD patients as compared with the controls. The levels of hBD-2 and HNP 1-3 were significantly elevated in the sera and in the CSF of the AD patients These data suggest that both defensin \u03b2-2 and \u03b1-defensins have potential role in the development of AD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033d2","authors":["Szekeres, Martha","Ivitz, Eszter","Datki, Zsolt","K\u00e1lm\u00e1n, J\u00e1nos","P\u00e1k\u00e1ski, Magdolna","V\u00e1rhelyi, Zolt\u00e1n P","Kliv\u00e9nyi, P\u00e9ter","Zadori, D\u00e9nes","Somogyv\u00e1ri, Ferenc","Szolnoki, Zolt\u00e1n","V\u00e9csei, L\u00e1szl\u00f3","M\u00e1ndi, Yvette"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.psychres.2016.03.045","endpage":"345","first_seen_on":"2016-04-16T11:25:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1872-7123","01651781"],"journal":"Psychiatry Research","last_mentioned_on":1461366875,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27082275?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27082275"],"pmid":"27082275","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"342","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Relevance of defensin \u03b2-2 and \u03b1 defensins (HNP1-3) in Alzheimer's disease","type":"article","volume":"239","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/relevance-defensin-%CE%B22-%CE%B1-defensins-hnp13-alzheimers-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7588328,"mean":6.5418890751503,"rank":725248,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":6833486,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7588328,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245094,"mean":11.794934282089,"rank":36573,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":207627,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245094,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3510,"mean":4.5246771159875,"rank":283,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":3207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3510,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120,"mean":3.9441176470588,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
