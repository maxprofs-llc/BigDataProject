Employing macro-statistical data, the paper argues that this change process has unfolded stepwise and relatively late despite major political and economic transformations in post-socialist Poland. Using a historical-institutionalist perspective, the paper focuses on processes of institutional change, including layering, displacement, and dismantling. One major finding is that the speed and depth of the gradual transformation differs considerably between the three research performing sectors of the Polish public science system. As the Polish Academy of Sciences was reproduced institutionally, the former governmental units for applied R&D were partly dismantled and displaced by private sector R&D units. In contrast, the Higher Education sector underwent a strong expansion and, thus, layering of new research activities and fields. Since policy shifts within the PPSS occurred relatively late, the more than two decades following the collapse of communism are of special interest to scholars of incremental, yet cumulative, institutional change.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Steffi Heinecke"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0153260","first_seen_on":"2016-04-16T11:28:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"4","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1461071772,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0153260"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0153260.PDF","pmid":"27077386","pubdate":"2016-04-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0153260","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"The Gradual Transformation of the Polish Public Science System","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gradual-transformation-polish-public-science-system"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.95,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7571218,"mean":6.5337981331095,"rank":2842674,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4717931,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7571218,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244807,"mean":11.801463191261,"rank":83115,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":161078,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244807,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107917,"mean":10.211196708551,"rank":37608,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":70119,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107917,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5233,"mean":13.176081804281,"rank":1981,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":3244,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5233,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
