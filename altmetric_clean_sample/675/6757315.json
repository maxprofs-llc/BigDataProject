Their effectiveness is influenced by within as well as between team processes (i.e. communication, coordination) and emergent phenomena (i.e. situational awareness). The present case study explores the way in which the emergent structures and the involvement of bystanders intertwine with the dynamics of processes and emergent states both within and between the component teams. Our findings show that inefficient transition process and the ambiguous leadership generated poor coordination and hindered the development of emergent phenomena within the whole system. Emergent structures and bystanders substituted leadership functions and provided a pool of critical resources for the MTS. Their involvement fostered the emergence of situational awareness and facilitated contingency planning processes. However, bystander involvement impaired the emergence of cross-understandings and interfered with coordination processes between the component teams. Practitioner Summary: Based on a real emergency situation, the present research provides important theoretical and practical insights about the role of bystander involvement in the dynamics of multi-team systems composed to tackle complex tasks and respond to fast changing and unpredictable environmental contingencies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d73cf058f610001232","authors":["Alina Maria Fle\u015ftea"],"doi":"10.1080\/00140139.2016.1162852","endpage":"15","first_seen_on":"2016-04-16T15:11:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1366-5847","0014-0139"],"journal":"Ergonomics","last_mentioned_on":1461569111,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/00140139.2016.1162852?journalCode=terg20","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/00140139.2016.1162852"],"pmid":"27054405","pubdate":"2016-04-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Design Practice And Management","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"\u2018We didn\u2019t know anything, it was a mess!\u2019 Emergent structures and the effectiveness of a rescue operation multi-team system","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/we-didnt-know-anything-it-mess-emergent-structures-effectiveness-rescue-operation-multiteam-system"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7601780,"mean":6.5482482934541,"rank":5483337,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1849091,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7601780,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245238,"mean":11.795848220293,"rank":158507,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":72573,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245238,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1191,"mean":4.3312705882353,"rank":990,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":191,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1191,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":2.9360655737705,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
