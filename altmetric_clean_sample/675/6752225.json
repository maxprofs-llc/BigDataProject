Vitamin B-12 deficiency causes megaloblastic anemia and impairs growth and development in children.\nWe measured vitamin B-12 in breast milk and examined its associations with household hunger, recent animal-source food consumption, and vitamin B-12 intake.\nIn a cross-sectional substudy nested within a cluster-randomized trial assessing water, sanitation, hygiene, and nutrition interventions in Kenya, we sampled 286 women 1-6 mo postpartum. Mothers hand-expressed breast milk 1 min into a feeding after 90 min observed nonbreastfeeding. The Household Hunger Scale was used to measure hunger, food intake in the previous week was measured with the use of a food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and vitamin B-12 intake was estimated by using 24-h dietary recall. An animal-source food score was based on 10 items from the FFQ (range: 0-70). Breast milk vitamin B-12 concentration was measured with the use of a solid-phase competitive chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay and was modeled with linear regression. Generalized estimating equations were used to account for correlated observations at the cluster level.\nMedian (IQR) vitamin B-12 intake was 1.5 \u03bcg\/d (0.3, 9.7 \u03bcg\/d), and 60% of women consumed <2.4 \u03bcg\/d, the estimated average requirement during lactation. Median (IQR) breast milk vitamin B-12 concentration was 113 pmol\/L (61, 199 pmol\/L); 89% had concentrations <310 pmol\/L, the estimated adequate concentration. Moderate or severe hunger prevalence was 27%; the animal-source food score ranged from 0 to 30 item-d\/wk. Hunger and recent animal-source food and vitamin B-12 intake were not associated with breast milk vitamin B-12 concentrations. Maternal age was negatively associated with breast milk vitamin B-12 concentrations.\nMost lactating Kenyan women consumed less than the estimated average requirement of vitamin B-12 and had low breast milk vitamin B-12 concentrations. We recommend interventions that improve vitamin B-12 intake in lactating Kenyan women to foster maternal health and child development. The main trial was registered atclinicaltrials.govasNCT01704105.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e8d","authors":["Williams, Anne M","Chantry, Caroline J","Young, Sera L","Achando, Beryl S","Allen, Lindsay H","Arnold, Benjamin F","Colford, John M","Dentz, Holly N","Hampel, Daniela","Kiprotich, Marion C","Lin, Audrie","Null, Clair A","Nyambane, Geoffrey M","Shahab-Ferdows, Setti","Stewart, Christine P","Anne M Williams","Caroline J Chantry","Sera L Young","Beryl S Achando","Lindsay H Allen","Benjamin F Arnold","John M Colford","Holly N Dentz","Daniela Hampel","Marion C Kiprotich","Audrie Lin","Clair A Null","Geoffrey M Nyambane","Setti Shahab-Ferdows","Christine P Stewart"],"doi":"10.3945\/jn.115.228189","endpage":"1131","first_seen_on":"2016-04-16T08:11:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1541-6100","0022-3166"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1467370900,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27075905\/?i=3&from=b-12","http:\/\/jn.nutrition.org\/content\/early\/2016\/04\/13\/jn.115.228189.long","http:\/\/jn.nutrition.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/146\/5\/1125?rss=1","http:\/\/jn.nutrition.org\/content\/early\/2016\/04\/13\/jn.115.228189.abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27075905"],"pmid":"27075905","pubdate":"2016-04-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"1125","subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Vitamin B-12 Concentrations in Breast Milk Are Low and Are Not Associated with Reported Household Hunger, Recent Animal-Source Food, or Vitamin B-12 Intake in Women in Rural Kenya","type":"article","volume":"146","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vitamin-b12-concentrations-breast-milk-low-not-associated-reported-household-hunger-recent-animalsou"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7974292,"mean":6.7330879653071,"rank":1668686,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6295574,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7974292,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":247736,"mean":11.855370036531,"rank":69211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":178001,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":247736,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3833,"mean":13.021195720251,"rank":1505,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":2323,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3833,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84,"mean":29.020289156627,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
