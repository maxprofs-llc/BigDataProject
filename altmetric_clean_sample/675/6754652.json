Because 61 sense codons encode 20 amino acids, reassigning the meaning of sense codons provides an avenue for biosynthetic modification of proteins, furthering both fundamental and applied biochemical research. We developed a simple screen that exploits the absolute requirement for fluorescence of an active site tyrosine in green fluorescent protein (GFP) to probe the pliability of the degeneracy of the genetic code. Our screen monitors the restoration of the fluorophore of GFP by incorporation of a tyrosine in response to a sense codon typically assigned another meaning in the genetic code. We evaluated sense codon reassignment at 4 of the 21 sense codons read through wobble interactions in E. coli using the Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (M. jannaschii) orthogonal tRNA\/aminoacyl tRNA synthetase pair originally developed and commonly used for amber stop codon suppression. By changing only the anticodon of the orthogonal tRNA, sense codon reassignment efficiencies between 1% (Phe UUU) and 6% (Lys AAG) were achieved. Each of the orthogonal tRNAs preferentially decoded the codon traditionally read via a wobble interaction in E. coli with the exception of the orthogonal tRNA with an AUG anticodon, which incorporated tyrosine in response to both the His CAU and His CAC codons with approximately equal frequency. We applied our screen in a high throughput manner to evaluate a 109 member combined tRNA\/aminoacyl tRNA synthetase library to identify improved sense codon reassigning variants for the Lys AAG codon. A single, rapid screen with the ability to broadly evaluate reassignable codons will facilitate identification and improvement of the combinations of sense codons and orthogonal pairs that display efficient reassignment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c7","authors":["Biddle, Wil","Schmitt, Margaret Alice","Fisk, John Domenic"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.biochem.5b00870","endpage":"7364","first_seen_on":"2016-04-16T11:15:21+00:00","issns":["1520-4995","0006-2960"],"issue":"50","journal":"Biochemistry (00062979)","last_mentioned_on":1460801348,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26536053?dopt=Abstract&http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/erss.cgi?rss_guid=12auu1PYsGCNpo6akauPh2r5KY5WDOs2B1hbPBXflIdOhD8YA8","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26536053?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26536053","pubdate":"2015-12-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"7355","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Evaluating Sense Codon Reassignment with a Simple Fluorescence Screen","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluating-sense-codon-reassignment-simple-fluorescence-screen"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7556298,"mean":6.524637537139,"rank":5452878,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1836653,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7556298,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244644,"mean":11.797634177148,"rank":158250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":72416,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244644,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6623,"mean":2.6288115372999,"rank":5551,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":972,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6623,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":140,"mean":1.8776258992806,"rank":80,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":140,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
