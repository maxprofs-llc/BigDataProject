Alternatively, the coupled nitrogen-sulfur-carbon cycles involved into TPH biodegradation under sulfate- and nitrate reducing conditions can be investigated using nitrogen (\u03b4(15)N) and sulfur (\u03b4(34)S) isotopic shifts in terminal electron acceptors (TEA) involved in anaerobic TPH oxidation. Biodegradation of a paraffin-rich crude oil was studied in anaerobic aquifer microcosms with nitrate (NIT), sulfate (SUL), nitrate plus sulfate (MIX) and nitrate under sulfate reduction suppression by molybdate (MOL) as TEA. After 8 months, TPH biodegradation was not different (around 33%) in experiments receiving only nitrate (NIT, MOL) versus under mixed TEA-conditions (MIX), despite higher biodiversity under mixed conditions (H'NIT and H'MOL \u2248 5.9, H'MIX=8.0). Molybdate addition effected higher nitrate depletion, possibly by increasing the production of nitrate reductase. Additional sulfate depletion under mixed conditions suggested bioconversion of polar intermediates. Microcosms only receiving sulfate (SUL) showed no significant TEA and TPH decrease. A Rayleigh kinetic isotope enrichment model for isotopic (15)N\/(14)N and (34)S\/(32)S shifts in residual TEA gave apparent enrichment factors \u025bN,NIT and \u025bN,MOL values of -16.7 to -18.0 \u2030 for nitrate as sole TEA and \u025bN,MIX of -6.0\u2030 and \u025bS,MIX of -4.1\u2030 under mixed electron accepting conditions. The low isotopic fractionation under mixed terminal electron accepting conditions was attributed to lithotrophic, sulfide-dependent denitrification by Thiobacillus species, while it was hypothesized that Desulfovibrio replenished the reduced sulfur pool via oxidation of polar hydrocarbon metabolites. Concurrently, organotrophic denitrification was performed by Pseudomonas species, with isotopic fractionation expressed by \u025bN,MIX representing the superposition of both denitrification processes. This is, to our knowledge, the first characterization of sulfur and nitrogen isotopic shifts associated to concurrent organotrophic and lithotrophic denitrification in a hydrocarbon-contaminated environment, and offers the prospect of improved understanding of biogeochemical cycles including in situ hydrocarbon biotransformation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031b5","authors":["Kern, Martin","Watzinger, Andrea","Scherr, Kerstin E"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.nbt.2016.03.004","first_seen_on":"2016-04-16T16:46:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1876-4347","18716784"],"journal":"New Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1460825167,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27079862?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27079862","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biomedicalengineering"],"title":"15N-nitrate and 34S-sulfate isotopic fractionation reflects electron acceptor \u2018recycling\u2019 during hydrocarbon biodegradation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/15nnitrate-34ssulfate-isotopic-fractionation-reflects-electron-acceptor-recycling-during-hydrocarbon"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7556298,"mean":6.524637537139,"rank":3903543,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2115160,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7556298,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244643,"mean":11.797656444928,"rank":133792,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":86628,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244643,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320,"mean":2.4037742946708,"rank":136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":136,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.6298181818182,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Unspecified":1,"Environmental Science":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/pseudo_papers\/statuses\/721379152582959104","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6757869],"posted_on":"2016-04-16T16:46:07+00:00","author":{"name":"pseudomonaspapers","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/?term=pseudomonas","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/570219565901029376\/j3RfXxUz_normal.jpeg","description":"PubMed search bot for pseudomonas.
