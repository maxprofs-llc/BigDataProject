A column proportions z test with a Bonferroni adjustment was used to analyze proportional differences. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to examine mean group differences.\nStudents who woke up prior to 6\u00a0a.m. and got less than 8\u00a0h of sleep (27\u00a0%) were significantly more likely to report studying 11 or more hours per week (30\u00a0%), almost double the rate compared to students who got more than 8\u00a0h of sleep and woke up the latest (16\u00a0%). Post hoc results revealed students who woke up at 7\u00a0a.m. or later reported significantly higher high school grades than all other groups (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), with the exception of those students who woke up between 6:01\u00a0a.m. and 7:00\u00a0a.m. and got eight or more hours of sleep. The highest reported SAT\/ACT scores were from the group that woke up after 7\u00a0a.m. but got less than 8\u00a0h sleep (M\u00a0=\u00a01099.5). Their scores were significantly higher than all other groups.\nThis study provides additional evidence that increased sleep and later wake time are associated with increased high school grades. However, this study also found that students who sleep the longest also reported less studying and lower SAT\/ACT scores.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6383cf058f61000894b","authors":["James S Cole"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11325-016-1341-0","first_seen_on":"2016-04-16T15:41:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1522-1709"],"journal":"Sleep and Breathing","last_mentioned_on":1460821244,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs11325-016-1341-0"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs11325-016-1341-0.pdf","pmid":"27085866","pubdate":"2016-04-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Do later wake times and increased sleep duration of 12th graders result in more studying, higher grades, and improved SAT\/ACT test scores?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/later-wake-times-increased-sleep-duration-12th-graders-result-more-studying-higher-grades-improved-s"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7556298,"mean":6.524637537139,"rank":6544963,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7556298,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244643,"mean":11.797662780716,"rank":206382,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244643,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":692,"mean":2.4756960926194,"rank":521,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":692,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":1.0306451612903,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/721362698835861504","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6757515],"posted_on":"2016-04-16T15:40:44+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":978},"tweet_id":"721362698835861504"}]}}
