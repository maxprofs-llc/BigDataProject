Patients (n = 133) with high-risk genotypes (DR3\/DR3, DR3\/DR4, DR4\/DR4) were selected from the Lazio (Rome) region of Italy. Screening of more than 9000 patients from the Lazio region and northern Italy yielded 162 controls with high-T1D-risk haplotypes. Although the overall distributions did not differ significantly, allele frequency differences were discovered between the controls from Lazio and controls from northern Italy for some alleles previously determined to affect T1D risk, such as A*3002, DPB1*0301, and DPB1*0402. Therefore, Lazio patient data were compared both with the Lazio subset of controls (n = 53) and with the entire group of controls for association analyses. Significant allele frequency differences between patients and DR-DQ-matched controls existed for specific alleles at all loci. Data for the DR3\/DR3 subset of patients and controls demonstrated an increase of Cw*0702 in patients. Compared with controls, reduced patient frequencies were seen for several alleles, including A*0101, B*0801, and Cw*0701, all on the highly conserved, extended DR3 haplotype known as 8.1 in DR3\/DR3, but not DR3\/DR4, subgroup. DPB1*0101, often reported on 8.1 haplotypes, was also less frequent in DR3\/DR3 patients than controls. Analysis of family-based data from the HBDI repository was consistent with the observed results from the Italian patients, indicating the presence of a T1D-protective locus at or near A*0101 and a second T1D-protective locus at or near DPB1*0101. These data indicate that T1D risk conferred by the 8.1 haplotype is genotype dependent.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002a0e","doi":"10.1016\/j.humimm.2008.02.003","first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T14:28:10+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Human Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1219506664,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.humimm.2008.02.003","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18486765","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2505335"],"pmid":"18486765","pubdate":"2007-12-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Type 1 diabetes risk for HLA-DR3 haplotypes depends on genotypic context: Association of DPB1 and HLA class I loci among DR3 and DR4 matched Italian patients and controls","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/type-1-diabetes-risk-human-leukocyte-antigen-hladr3-haplotypes-depends-genotypic-context-association"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629179,"mean":4.9362043867828,"rank":816616,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2289704,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629179,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95338,"mean":8.1713778281257,"rank":24754,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69495,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95338,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":499,"mean":2.2015381526104,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":224,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":499,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.875,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":8,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":3}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"HLA-A1","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=233745679#altmetric_citation_53","license":"public","citation_ids":[3455559],"posted_on":"2008-08-23T15:08:35+00:00","summary":"HLA-A1 (A1) is a human leukocyte antigen serotype within HLA-A&nbsp;&quot;A&quot; serotype group.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=13240595","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Pdeitiker","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Pdeitiker"}},{"title":"HLA A1-B8 haplotype","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=233751956#altmetric_citation_12","license":"public","citation_ids":[3455559],"posted_on":"2008-08-23T15:51:04+00:00","summary":"HLA A1-B8 (Also:HL A1,8; HL A1,A8; HLA A1-Cw7-B8; HLA A*01-B*08, HLA A*0101-B*0801, HLA A*0101-Cw*0701-B*0801; HLA A*01:01-C*07:01-B*08:01) is a multigene haplotype that covers the MHC Class I region of the human major histocompatibility complex on chromos","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=18996259","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Pdeitiker","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Pdeitiker"}}]}}
