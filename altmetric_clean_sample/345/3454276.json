A total of 18 Cw alleles were identified, with Cw*0401\/5 and 1601 accounting for a combined frequency of 36%. A comparison of Cw allele frequencies among several populations of different origins, Mandenka, Swiss, English, Ashkenazi Jews from the UK and Japanese, reveals a high genetic heterogeneity among them, but also a much closer relationship between Mandenka, Europeans and Ashkenazi than between any of these populations and Japanese. Cw*0501, Cw*0701 and Cw*1601, among others, appear to be restricted to the European and African populations. Many B-Cw haplotypes exhibit a significant linkage disequilibrium in the Mandenka, among which B*3501-Cw*0401 and B*7801-Cw*1601, formed by the most frequent B and Cw alleles, and B*5201-Cw*1601, B*5702-Cw*18 and B*4410-Cw*0401, not yet observed in other populations. B*3501-Cw*0401 is found with similar frequencies in Europeans. The results possibly support a close historical relationship between Africans and Europeans as compared to East Asiatics. However, the HLA-Cw frequency distributions are characterised by an excess of heterozygotes, indicating that balancing selection may have played a role in the evolution of this polymorphism.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f61000366d","authors":["A Sanchez-Mazas","Q G Steiner","C Grundschober","J M Tiercy","Sanchez-Mazas, A","Steiner, Q G","Grundschober, C","Tiercy, J M"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T13:58:11+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["0001-2815"],"issue":"4","journal":"Tissue Antigens","last_mentioned_on":1248968960,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11098930"],"pmid":"11098930","pubdate":"2000-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"The molecular determination of HLA-Cw alleles in the Mandenka (West Africa) reveals a close genetic relationship between Africans and Europeans.","type":"article","volume":"56","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-determination-hlacw-alleles-mandenka-west-africa-reveals-close-genetic-relationship-betwee"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3990102,"mean":5.0362064143623,"rank":917498,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2528427,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3990102,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126930,"mean":9.1319784598902,"rank":38529,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":86650,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126930,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":664,"mean":2.2527269984917,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":268,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":664,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.01,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2,"Unspecified":2}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"HLA-A80","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=235229523#altmetric_citation_3","license":"public","citation_ids":[3454272,3454276],"posted_on":"2008-08-30T18:55:22+00:00","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=13281278","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Pdeitiker","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Pdeitiker"}},{"title":"HLA-A33","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=159317357#altmetric_citation_26","license":"public","citation_ids":[3454272,3454276],"posted_on":"2007-09-21T03:40:30+00:00","summary":"A33 shows two different distributions that can be discriminated by subtyping capability of SSP-PCR.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=13319423","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Pdeitiker","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Pdeitiker"}},{"title":"A30-Cw5-B18-DR3-DQ2 (HLA Haplotype)","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=305095286#altmetric_citation_9","license":"public","citation_ids":[3454272,3454276],"posted_on":"2009-07-30T15:49:20+00:00","summary":"HLA A30-Cw5-B18-DR3-DQ2 (A30::DQ2) is a multigene haplotype that extends across a majority of the major histocompatibility complex on human chromosome 6.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=23801823","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Pdeitiker","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Pdeitiker"}}]}}
