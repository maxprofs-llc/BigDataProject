The recent report of a translocation that disrupted the gene in an individual with mental retardation and autistic behavior prompted us to examine GRPR as a possible locus for RTT. Genomic polymerase chain reaction amplification of exons followed by single-strand conformation analysis screening in 25 unrelated RTT-affected individuals and by direct sequencing in 12 others has failed to detect any mutation. No gross structural rearrangements were found by Southern analysis of DNA from six unrelated RTT-affected individuals. A high-frequency biallelic polymorphism caused by two single nucleotide substitutions in exon 2 was discovered. The allele frequencies were identical in the RTT population as compared to 100 normal control X chromosomes. This polymorphism will enable future evaluation of the GRPR locus as a candidate for other X-linked mental retardation or neurobehavioral syndromes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9023cf058f61000ca38","authors":["G Heidary","L L Hampton","N C Schanen","M J Rivkin","B T Darras","J Battey","U Francke"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T14:02:35+00:00","issns":["0148-7299"],"issue":"2","journal":"American Journal of Medical Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1196580118,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9674911"],"pmid":"9674911","pubdate":"1998-06-30T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Exclusion of the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) locus as a candidate gene for Rett syndrome.","type":"article","volume":"78","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exclusion-gastrinreleasing-peptide-receptor-grpr-locus-candidate-gene-rett-syndrome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626860,"mean":4.9517239589446,"rank":817850,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2285473,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626860,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94795,"mean":8.1058745490221,"rank":24533,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69168,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94795,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":696,"mean":2.6528892086331,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":164,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":696,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
