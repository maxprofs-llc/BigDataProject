Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), the prototype of the family, is a largely genetic disease, with human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-B27 being the essential gene. Other genes in the HLA region have also been implicated. The purpose of this study was to identify the alleles of the HLA-A, -B, -C, -DR, and -DQ, which are present at higher frequencies in USpA patients compared with an ethnically matched control population.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005cd3","doi":"10.1016\/j.semarthrit.2007.04.004","first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T13:10:11+00:00","issns":["0049-0172"],"journal":"Seminars in Arthritis & Rheumatism","last_mentioned_on":1188565214,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.semarthrit.2007.04.004","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17604825"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.semarthritisrheumatism.com\/article\/S0049017207000765\/pdf","pmid":"17604825","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"Human leukocyte antigens in undifferentiated spondyloarthritis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/human-leukocyte-antigens-undifferentiated-spondyloarthritis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3624912,"mean":4.93425642237,"rank":816691,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2284624,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3624912,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94451,"mean":7.6306160508206,"rank":24120,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":69242,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94451,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208,"mean":3.4802512077295,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":135,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.4357142857143,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
