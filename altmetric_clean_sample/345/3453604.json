The CBFA2 gene is disrupted by the (8;21), (3;21), and (12;21) chromosomal translocations associated with leukemias and myelodysplasias in humans. Mice lacking a CBF alpha 2 protein capable of binding DNA die between embryonic days 11.5 and 12.5 due to hemorrhaging in the central nervous system (CNS), at the nerve\/CNS interfaces of cranial and spinal nerves, and in somitic\/intersomitic regions along the presumptive spinal cord. Hemorrhaging is preceded by symmetric, bilateral necrosis in these regions. Definitive erythropoiesis and myelopoiesis do not occur in Cbfa2-deficient embryos, and disruption of one copy of the Cbfa2 gene significantly reduces the number of progenitors for erythroid and myeloid cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Q Wang","T Stacy","M Binder","M Marin-Padilla","A H Sharpe","N A Speck"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T13:42:43+00:00","issns":["1091-6490","0027-8424"],"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1217358842,"links":["http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/93\/8\/3444.abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.93.8.3444","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8622955","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC39628","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8622955?dopt=Abstract&holding=npg\/pubmed\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/93\/8\/3444.full.pdf","pmid":"8622955","publisher":"National Acad Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Disruption of the Cbfa2 gene causes necrosis and hemorrhaging in the central nervous system and blocks definitive hematopoiesis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/disruption-cbfa2-gene-causes-necrosis-hemorrhaging-central-nervous-system-blocks-definitive-hematopo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4763379,"mean":5.4984634704477,"rank":1116251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":3060885,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4763379,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163941,"mean":8.9146220446506,"rank":48545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":113216,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163941,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38307,"mean":16.61417971075,"rank":16046,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":15224,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38307,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":959,"mean":44.108893528184,"rank":602,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":346,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":959,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":25,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
