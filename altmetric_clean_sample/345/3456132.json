Recently, a structurally related peptide, neuromedin S (NMS), which shares an amidated C-terminal heptapeptide motif, has been identified in both rat and human, and has been proposed as a second ligand for these receptors. Messenger RNA encoding NMU receptor subtypes shows differential expression: NMU(1) is predominantly expressed in peripheral tissues, particularly the gastrointestinal tract, whereas NMU(2) is abundant within the brain and spinal cord. NMU peptide parallels receptor distribution with highest expression in the gastrointestinal tract and specific structures within the brain, reflecting its major role in the regulation of energy balance. The NMU knockout mouse has an obese phenotype and, in agreement, the Arg165Trp amino acid variant of NMU-25 in humans, which is functionally inactive, co-segregated with childhood-onset obesity. Emerging physiological roles for NMU include vasoconstriction mediated predominantly via NMU(1) with nociception and bone remodelling via NMU(2). The NMU system has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of septic shock and cancers including bladder carcinoma and acute myeloid leukaemia. Intriguingly, NMS is more potent at NMU(2) receptors in vivo where it has similar central actions in suppression of feeding and regulation of circadian rhythms to NMU. Taken together with its vascular actions, NMU may be a functional link between energy balance and the cardiovascular system and may provide a future target for therapies directed against the disorders that comprise metabolic syndrome.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002450","authors":["Mitchell, JD","Maguire, JJ","Davenport, AP","Mitchell JD","Maguire JJ","Davenport AP","JD Mitchell","JJ Maguire","AP Davenport"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1476-5381.2009.00252.x","endpage":"103","first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T14:41:22+00:00","issns":["1476-5381","0007-1188","00071188","14765381"],"issue":"1","journal":"British Journal of Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1246940693,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1476-5381.2009.00252.x","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19519756","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2795236"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1476-5381.2009.00252.x\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC2795236","pmid":"19519756","pubdate":"2009-06-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"87","subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Emerging pharmacology and physiology of neuromedin U and the structurally related peptide neuromedin S","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1476-5381.2009.00252.x","volume":"158","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/emerging-pharmacology-physiology-neuromedin-u-structurally-related-peptide-neuromedin-s"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4681522,"mean":5.6990934027662,"rank":1130582,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2962306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4681522,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164664,"mean":9.0187749038948,"rank":49135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":113329,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164664,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2024,"mean":4.1582748393475,"rank":382,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":1053,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2024,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":3.8264,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
