The report provides updated recommendations to improve prevention of perinatal and early childhood HBV transmission, including implementation of universal infant vaccination beginning at birth, and to increase vaccine coverage among previously unvaccinated children and adolescents. Strategies to enhance implementation of the recommendations include 1) establishing standing orders for administration of hepatitis B vaccination beginning at birth; 2) instituting delivery hospital policies and procedures and case management programs to improve identification of and administration of immunoprophylaxis to infants born to mothers who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive and to mothers with unknown HBsAg status at the time of delivery; and 3) implementing vaccination record reviews for all children aged 11-12 years and children and adolescents aged <19 years who were born in countries with intermediate and high levels of HBV endemicity, adopting hepatitis B vaccine requirements for school entry, and integrating hepatitis B vaccination services into settings that serve adolescents. The second part of the ACIP statement, which will include updated recommendations and strategies to increase hepatitis B vaccination of adults, will be published separately.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5063cf058f6100030f7","authors":["Mast EE","Margolis HS","Fiore AE","Brink EW","Goldstein ST","Wang SA","Moyer LA","Bell BP","Alter MJ"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T14:50:53+00:00","issns":["1057-5987"],"issue":"RR-16","journal":"MMWR Recommendations & Reports","last_mentioned_on":1436976600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16371945","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16371945"],"pmid":"16371945","pubdate":"2005-12-24T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"A comprehensive immunization strategy to eliminate transmission of hepatitis B virus infection in the United States: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) part 1: immunization of infants, children, and adolescents.","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comprehensive-immunization-strategy-eliminate-transmission-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-united-states-90"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.08,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8096639,"mean":6.890087373789,"rank":1034783,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7044610,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8096639,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242559,"mean":8.3509809530092,"rank":38190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":204296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242559,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104,"mean":52.241223300971,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":75,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Fifty Shades of Cancer Immunostimulation: Cancer Vaccines","url":"http:\/\/aapsblog.aaps.org\/2015\/07\/15\/fifty-shades-of-cancer-immunostimulation-cancer-vaccines\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[660807,3456578,4278688,4278689],"posted_on":"2015-07-15T04:05:00+00:00","summary":"By Robert G.
