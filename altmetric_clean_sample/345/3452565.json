The lungs were ventilated with room air, and the inflowing perfusate blood gases were similar to those in mixed venous blood in vivo. All experiments were performed at 37 degrees C. Rates of CO2 excretion were determined by measuring the fraction of CO2 in mixed expired gas in a steady state. The time-course of extracellular pH equilibration in the effluent perfusate was measured in a downstream stopflow pH electrode apparatus. CO2 excretion was reduced by approximately 16% when the lungs were perfused with suspensions containing erythrocytes whose HCO-3\/Cl- exchange rates was inhibited, compared with CO2 excretion when the lungs were perfused with normal erythrocyte suspensions. A fall of 0.06 in effluent perfusate extracellular pH was noted during perfusion with inhibited erythrocyte suspensions, in contrast to no observable downstream pH change during perfusion with normal erythrocyte suspensions. These results are in close agreement with the predictions of a theoretical model. Our observations suggest that CO2 transfer in capillary beds will be adversely affected in vivo when the rate of the erythrocyte HCO-3\/Cl- exchange is abnormally low. Since a number of commonly used drugs are known to inhibit the chloride shift in human erythrocytes, these findings may have important clinical implications, especially in patients with impaired lung function.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cff","authors":["E D Crandall","S J Mathew","R S Fleischer","H I Winter","A Bidani","Crandall, E D","Mathew, S J","Fleischer, R S","Winter, H I","Bidani, A"],"doi":"10.1172\/jci110340","first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T13:20:29+00:00","issns":["0021-9738"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Clinical Investigation","last_mentioned_on":1188923395,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1172\/JCI110340","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/6793631","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC370872"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jci.org\/articles\/view\/110340\/files\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC370872","pmid":"6793631","pubdate":"2016-03-29T04:24:33+00:00","publisher":"American Society for Clinical Investigation","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Effects of inhibition of RBC HCO3-\/Cl- exchange on CO2 excretion and downstream pH disequilibrium in isolated rat lungs.","type":"article","volume":"68","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-inhibition-rbc-hco3cl-exchange-co2-excretion-downstream-ph-disequilibrium-isolated-rat-lungs"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4933086,"mean":5.8537222792671,"rank":1209212,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3130259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4933086,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178125,"mean":8.7435436325258,"rank":52752,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":122976,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178125,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4654,"mean":10.529926499033,"rank":1961,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":1854,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4654,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99,"mean":28.972408163265,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Chloride shift","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=155653706#altmetric_citation_0","license":"public","citation_ids":[3452565],"posted_on":"2007-09-04T16:29:55+00:00","summary":"Chloride shift (also known as the Hamburger shift or Hamburger phenomenon, named after Hartog Jakob Hamburger) is a process which occurs in a cardiovascular system and refers to the exchange of bicarbonate (HCO3-) and chloride (Cl-) across the membrane of","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=13030752","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"TimVickers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:TimVickers"}}]}}
