One of these forms of alteration is frequency shifted feedback. The effects of frequency shifted feedback was compared between two speaker groups that differed in age. The fluency enhancing effects of frequency shifted feedback was greater for adult speakers (mean age 21;3) than for children (mean age 9;11). The results are discussed in terms of their implications for theory and treatment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f43cf058f610002dab","authors":["Howell P","Sackin S","Williams R"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T13:56:00+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Fluency Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1199284198,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18259595"],"pmid":"18259595","pubdate":"2008-02-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Language, Communication And Culture","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Nursing","Health Professions","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["speechlanguagepathology"],"title":"Differential effects of frequency shifted feedback between child and adult stutterers.","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/differential-effects-frequency-shifted-feedback-between-child-adult-stutterers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630112,"mean":4.9307700568987,"rank":816214,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2291301,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630112,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95562,"mean":8.1936430761505,"rank":24849,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69619,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95562,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110,"mean":2.0367706422018,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":83,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1.85,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Linguistics":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Electronic fluency device","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=181604973#altmetric_citation_31","license":"public","citation_ids":[3454176,3454177],"posted_on":"2008-01-02T14:29:58+00:00","summary":"Electronic fluency devices (also known as assistive devices, electronic aids, altered auditory feedback devices and altered feedback devices) are electronic devices intended to improve the fluency of persons who stutter.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=13269219","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Slp1","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Slp1"}}]}}
