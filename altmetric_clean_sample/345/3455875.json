In this study, we present evidence that the contryphan family of peptides is widely distributed in venoms of the fish-hunting cone snails. We purified, synthesized and characterized contryphan-Sm from Conus stercusmuscarum venom, and obtained molecular evidence for the existence of a third peptide, contryphan-P from Conus purpurascens venom ducts. The sequences of these three contryphans showed identity in seven of eight amino acids and a conserved pattern of post-translational modification. We also demonstrate that contryphan-Sm equilibrates between two distinct conformational states.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002eaf","authors":["R Jacobsen","E C Jimenez","M Grilley","M Watkins","D Hillyard","L J Cruz","B M Olivera"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T14:35:14+00:00","issns":["1397-002X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Peptide Research","last_mentioned_on":1191103995,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9531419"],"pmid":"9531419","pubdate":"1998-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"The contryphans, a D-tryptophan-containing family of Conus peptides: interconversion between conformers.","type":"article","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/contryphans-dtrvptophancontaining-family-conus-peptides-interconversion-between-conformers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629051,"mean":4.9368884016521,"rank":816650,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2289533,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629051,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95330,"mean":8.1708519338294,"rank":24748,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69492,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95330,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":2.8501052631579,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
