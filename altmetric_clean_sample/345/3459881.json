STAT6-mediated transcription is depend ent on the C-terminal transcription activation domain (TAD), but the mechanisms by which STAT6 activates transcription are poorly understood. Here, we have identified the staphylococcal nuclease (SN)-like domain and tudor domain containing protein p100 as a STAT6 TAD interacting protein. p100 was originally characterized as a transcriptional coactivator for Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2. STAT6 interacted with p100 in vitro and in vivo. The interaction was mediated by the TAD domain of STAT6 and the SN-like domain of p100. p100 did not affect the immediate activation events of STAT6, but enhanced STAT6-mediated transcriptional activation and the IL-4-induced Igepsilon gene transcription in human B-cell line. Finally, p100 associated with the large subunit of RNA polymerase II and was mediating interaction between STAT6 and RNA polymerase II. These findings identify p100 as a novel coactivator for STAT6 and suggest that p100 functions as a bridging factor between STAT6 and the basal transcription machinery.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027b6","authors":["Jie Yang","Saara Aittom\u00e4ki","Marko Pesu","Kara Carter","Jussi Saarinen","Nisse Kalkkinen","Elliott Kieff","Olli Silvennoinen"],"doi":"10.1093\/emboj\/cdf463","first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T16:09:17+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1460-2075","0261-4189"],"issue":"18","journal":"EMBO Journal","last_mentioned_on":1248115440,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/emboj\/cdf463","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12234934","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC126276"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/emboj.embopress.org\/content\/embojnl\/21\/18\/4950.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC126276","pmid":"12234934","pubdate":"2002-09-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"EMBO Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"Identification of p100 as a coactivator for STAT6 that bridges STAT6 with RNA polymerase\u00a0II","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-p100-coactivator-stat6-bridges-stat6-rna-polymerase-ii"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634360,"mean":4.9196455088828,"rank":815903,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295967,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634360,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96234,"mean":8.2460056945124,"rank":25160,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69968,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96234,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4000,"mean":3.1859064766192,"rank":587,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":1738,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4000,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":7.5590909090909,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
