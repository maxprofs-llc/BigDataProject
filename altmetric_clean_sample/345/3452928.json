NMU-25 elicited a potent hypertensive effect in rats but little is known about its cardiovascular effects in humans. We examined the hypothesis that NMU fulfils the criteria for controlling vascular reactivity within the human cardiovascular system.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024b0","authors":["John D.
