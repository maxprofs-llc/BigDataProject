Once thought to be only molecular scaffolds that indirectly affected cellular functions through the binding of other proteins, recent in vitro studies have illustrated that they can function as actin nucleators in the formation of new filaments. The connection between formins and MTs is less well understood. In yeast, the MT effects appear to be dependent on the ability of formins to generate polarized actin cables whereas, in mammalian cells, formin signals that cause MT stabilization and polarization might be more direct. A subclass of formins, the Diaphanous-related formins (Drfs), can act as effectors for Rho small GTPases, yet it is not clear what GTPase binding contributes to formin function.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036a7","authors":["Bradley J Wallar","Arthur S Alberts"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T13:41:33+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0962-8924"],"issue":"8","journal":"Trends in Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1213016881,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12888296"],"pmid":"12888296","pubdate":"2003-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"The formins: active scaffolds that remodel the cytoskeleton.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/formins-active-scaffolds-remodel-cytoskeleton"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635018,"mean":4.9190323311044,"rank":816284,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295262,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635018,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96315,"mean":8.241061465623,"rank":25188,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":70019,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96315,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":551,"mean":3.0271309090909,"rank":105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":551,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":90.224,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":10,"Researcher":66,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Student  > Ph.
