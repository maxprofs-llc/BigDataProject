Lymph nodes were identified by preparation method, following interstitial injection of Jerota's blue fluid into mammary tissue, diaphragmatic surface of the liver, pleura, pericardium and diaphragm. The numbers of parasternal lymph nodes were determined for each age bracket of males and females. Parasternal lymph nodes at the level of intercostal spaces and costal cartilages on both sides of the sternum were counted. Relatively more lymph nodes were found at the right-hand side than at the left. There are relatively more parasternal lymph nodes at the level of three upper intercostal spaces on both sides of the sternum; these nodes are larger, too.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9163cf058f61000d003","authors":["M R Sapin","A I Shvedavchenko"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T13:59:47+00:00","issns":["0507-3758"],"issue":"5","journal":"Voprosy onkologii","last_mentioned_on":1190003349,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7245676"],"pmid":"7245676","pubdate":"1981-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"[Anatomy and topography of the parasternal lymph nodes in the adult].","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/anatomy-topography-parasternal-lymph-nodes-adult"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629816,"mean":4.9321920670937,"rank":816261,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290884,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629816,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95470,"mean":8.18905043522,"rank":24811,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69567,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95470,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.4782608695652,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Parasternal lymph nodes","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=158427537#altmetric_citation_0","license":"public","citation_ids":[3454362],"posted_on":"2007-09-17T04:29:09+00:00","summary":"The parasternal lymph nodes (or sternal glands) are placed at the anterior ends of the intercostal spaces, by the side of the internal thoracic artery.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=13302256","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Arcadian","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Arcadian"}}]}}
