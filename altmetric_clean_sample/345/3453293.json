Susceptibility to ethanol was increased in chronic portal hypertensive rats compared with sham-operated rats (55 +\/- 8% vs. 25 +\/- 4%). Both acute pretreatment (10 min) and chronic pretreatment (3 weeks) with propranolol reduced gastric mucosal injury induced by ethanol in portal hypertensive rats, compared with saline-treated rats. Acute and chronic pretreatment with propranolol had no protective effect in sham-operated rats. In portal hypertensive rats, sucralfate in two different doses (500 and 125 mg\/kg) protected the gastric mucosa against ethanol-induced gastric injury compared with animals receiving saline (2 +\/- 1% and 3 +\/- 2% vs. 25 +\/- 3%). Sucralfate at the higher dose did not reduce portal pressure in portal hypertensive rats. We conclude that: (1) chronic portal hypertension increases ethanol-induced gastric damage; (2) acute and chronic propranolol treatment reduces ethanol-induced gastric injury in portal hypertensive rats, probably by decreasing portal hypertension; (3) sucralfate has a cytoprotective effect in portal hypertensive rats without reducing portal pressure. These results suggest a potential application of sucralfate in patients otherwise treated by sclerotherapy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002ddb","authors":["P Geoffroy","A Duchateau","G Thi\u00e9fin","P Zeitoun"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T13:36:17+00:00","issns":["0168-8278"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Hepatology","last_mentioned_on":1187063276,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3693860"],"pmid":"3693860","pubdate":"1987-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Effects of propranolol and sucralfate on ethanol-induced gastric mucosal damage in chronic portal hypertensive rats.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-propranolol-sucralfate-ethanolinduced-gastric-mucosal-damage-chronic-portal-hypertensive-rat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627464,"mean":4.9483847763613,"rank":817654,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2286447,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627464,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94965,"mean":8.120717261278,"rank":24612,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94965,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":962,"mean":3.1589635796046,"rank":194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":577,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":962,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":2.3205882352941,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Portal hypertensive gastropathy","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=151097049#altmetric_citation_8","license":"public","citation_ids":[3453291,3453293],"posted_on":"2007-08-14T03:47:56+00:00","summary":"Portal hypertensive gastropathy refers to changes in the mucosa of the stomach in patients with portal hypertension; by far the most common cause of this is cirrhosis of the liver.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=12759967","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Samir","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Samir"}}]}}
