A*2402, A*3303, A*1101, A*0201, B*4403, B*5201, Cw*0102, Cw*1403, Cw*0304, Cw*0702, Cw*0801, and Cw*1202 showed frequencies of over 10%. Multi-locus haplotype frequencies were estimated by the maximum likelihood method. Strength of association between C and B loci was comparable with that between DRB1 and DQB1 loci. Alleles unidentified by a serological method and having very similar nucleotide sequences (A2: A*0201, A*0206, A*0207, B61: B*4002, B*4006) were carried by different haplotypes. Several frequent five-locus haplotypes were identified including A*3303-Cw*1403-B*4403-DRB1(*)1302-DQB1(*)0604, and A*2402-Cw*1202-B*5201-DRB1(*)1502-DQB1(*)0601. These sequence-based haplotypes corresponded to serology-based common haplotypes which have already been described in Japanese. These findings indicate that common HLA haplotypes consist of particular sets of HLA alleles and that these haplotypes have been conserved through recent human evolution.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a97","authors":["K Tokunaga","Y Ishikawa","A Ogawa","H Wang","S Mitsunaga","S Moriyama","L Lin","M Bannai","Y Watanabe","K Kashiwase","H Tanaka","T Akaza","K Tadokoro","T Juji"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T14:53:25+00:00","issns":["0093-7711"],"issue":"3","journal":"Immunogenetics","last_mentioned_on":1190348276,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9211745"],"pmid":"9211745","pubdate":"1997-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Sequence-based association analysis of HLA class I and II alleles in Japanese supports conservation of common haplotypes.","type":"article","volume":"46","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sequence-based-association-analysis-hla-class-i-ii-alleles-japanese-supports-conservation-common-hap"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629240,"mean":4.9358355666342,"rank":816562,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2289849,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629240,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95351,"mean":8.181093675931,"rank":24761,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69500,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95351,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":524,"mean":2.4101759082218,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":160,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":524,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.0625,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
