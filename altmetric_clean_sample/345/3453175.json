The interaction between Arabidopsis thaliana and its naturally occurring downy mildew pathogen, Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa), is a widely used reference pathosystem for plant-oomycete interactions. Current methods for measuring disease severity in the Arabidopsis-Hpa interaction rely on measurements at the terminal stage of pathogen development; namely, visual counts of spore-producing structures or quantifying spore production with a hemocytometer. These assays are useful, but do not offer sensitivity for robustly quantifying small changes in virulence or accurate quantification of pathogen growth prior to the reproductive stage. Here, we describe a quantitative PCR assay for monitoring Hpa growth in planta. The protocol is rapid, inexpensive, and can robustly distinguish small changes in virulence. We used this assay to investigate the dynamics of early Hpa mycelial growth and demonstrate proof of concept that this assay could be used in screens for novel oomycete growth inhibitors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5083cf058f61000311b","authors":["Anderson, Ryan G.","McDowell, John M.","Anderson RG","McDowell JM"],"doi":"10.1111\/mpp.12247","endpage":"898","first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T13:33:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1364-3703","1464-6722"],"issue":"8","journal":"Molecular Plant Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1466090854,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/mpp.12247\/abstract;jsessionid=C3B9DA1ED065D27708ECCDCE134AB3AE.f03t02","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/mpp.12247\/abstract;jsessionid=E7999B712ED3B18C1784894737D2486E.f02t03","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/mpp.12247\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25676785?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/mpp.12247\/pdf","pmid":"25676785","pubdate":"2015-05-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"893","subjects":["molecularbiology","botany"],"title":"A PCR assay for the quantification of growth of the oomycete pathogen Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis in Arabidopsis thaliana","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pcr-assay-quantification-growth-oomycete-pathogen-hyaloperonospora-arabidopsidis-arabidopsis-thalian"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7907411,"mean":6.6922707093667,"rank":1184045,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6719803,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7907411,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240946,"mean":8.223675220486,"rank":44177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":196616,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240946,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":781,"mean":4.6389692307692,"rank":152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":629,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":781,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":3.3604166666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":7},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":7,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
