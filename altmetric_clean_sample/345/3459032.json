Information on the origins of the oxygen atoms in four major metabolites of NO-HEX was obtained by metabolizing this compound in an 18O2 atmosphere using microsomes and cytosol, beta- and gamma-Hydroxy-NO-HEX are formed as a result of the insertion of a hydroxyl group derived from molecular oxygen into NO-HEX. All of the oxygen atoms in epsilon-aminocaproate (EAC) were derived from water. Approximately half of the molecules of epsilon- hydroxycaproate ( EHC ) contain an 18O atom; thus, half of the alpha-hydroxy-NO-HEX formed incorporates a hydroxyl group derived from molecular oxygen with the remainder of the hydroxyls being from water. To account for the above data and the related metabolic origins of EAC and EHC ( Hecker and McClusky , Cancer Res., 42 (1982) 59; Hecker et al., Teratogen. Carcinogen. Mutagen (1982) in press), we have proposed a mechanism for the formation of these compounds from cyclic nitrosamines catalyzed by microsomal and cytosolic enzymes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024ef","authors":["L I Hecker","Y Tondeur","J G Farrelly"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T15:49:06+00:00","issns":["0009-2797"],"issue":"1-2","journal":"Chemico-Biological Interactions","last_mentioned_on":1193281600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/6722936"],"pmid":"6722936","pubdate":"1984-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology","biochemistry"],"title":"Formation of epsilon-hydroxycaproate and epsilon-aminocaproate from N-nitrosohexamethyleneimine: evidence that microsomal alpha-hydroxylation of cyclic nitrosamines may not always involve the insertion of molecular oxygen into the substrate.","type":"article","volume":"49","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/formation-hydroxycaproate-aminocaproate-nnitrosohexamethyleneimine-evidence-microsomal-hydroxylation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4510149,"mean":5.2636614770391,"rank":1037575,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2908324,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4510149,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":152567,"mean":8.8985758688047,"rank":44517,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":106154,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":152567,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":402,"mean":1.7111521197007,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":288,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":402,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":1.3854166666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Chemistry":1,"Earth and Planetary Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"MY":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"6-hydroxyhexanoate dehydrogenase","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=166903376#altmetric_citation_1","license":"public","citation_ids":[3459029,3459032],"posted_on":"2007-10-25T03:06:40+00:00","summary":"Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 6-hydroxyhexanoate and NAD+, whereas its 3 products are 6-oxohexanoate, NADH, and H+.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=13902853","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"WillowW","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:WillowW"}}]}}
