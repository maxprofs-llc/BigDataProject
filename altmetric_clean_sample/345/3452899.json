The KCNN3 cDNA sequence contains two stretches of CAG trinucleotide repeats encoding two separate polyglutamine segments near the N-terminus of this channel protein. The second CAG repeat is highly polymorphic in the Caucasian population from both Europe and United States. The authors carried out a study to compare the allelic frequency distribution of the CAG repeat in KCNN3 gene in 55 Serbian schizophrenic patients and 46 controls. The data indicate a significant association between longer CAG repeats in second polymorphic KCNN3 region and schizophrenia in the Serbian population.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e78","doi":"10.1080\/00207450341514","first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T13:27:37+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"International Journal of Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1252961193,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1080\/00207450341514","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16393881"],"pmid":"16393881","pubdate":"2006-01-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Schizophrenia and polymorphic CAG repeats array of calcium-activated potassium channel (KCNN3) gene in Serbian population.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/schizophrenia-polymorphic-cag-repeats-array-calciumactivated-potassium-channel-kcnn3-gene-serbian-po"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628371,"mean":4.9417862081361,"rank":817145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288195,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628371,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95207,"mean":8.1649295422559,"rank":24711,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69410,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95207,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":478,"mean":2.9849601677149,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":478,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"SK3","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=313958495#altmetric_citation_14","license":"public","citation_ids":[3452899],"posted_on":"2009-09-14T20:46:33+00:00","summary":"SK3 (small conductance calcium-activated potassium channel 3) also known as KCa2.3 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the KCNN3 gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=12536918","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Boghog","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Boghog"}}]}}
