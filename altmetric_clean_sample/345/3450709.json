Here, we report that the AA metabolite 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) activates the ligand-dependent activation domain (AF2) of PPARbeta\/delta in vivo, competes with synthetic agonists in a PPARbeta\/delta ligand binding assay in vitro, and triggers the interaction of PPARbeta\/delta with coactivator peptides. These agonistic effects were also seen with PPARalpha and PPARgamma, but to a significantly weaker extent. We further show that 15-HETE strongly induces the expression of the bona fide PPAR target gene Angptl4 in a PPARbeta\/delta-dependent manner and, conversely, that inhibition of 15-HETE synthesis reduces PPARbeta\/delta transcriptional activity. Consistent with its function as an agonistic ligand, 15-HETE triggers profound changes in chromatin-associated PPARbeta\/delta complexes in vivo, including the recruitment of the coactivator cAMP response element-binding protein binding protein. Both 15R-HETE and 15S-HETE are similarly potent at inducing PPARbeta\/delta coactivator binding and transcriptional activation, indicating that 15-HETE enantiomers generated by different pathways function as PPARbeta\/delta agonists.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081e7","authors":["Simone Naruhn","Wolfgang Meissner","Till Adhikary","Kerstin Kaddatz","Thomas Klein","Bernhard Watzer","Sabine M\u00fcller-Br\u00fcsselbach","Rolf M\u00fcller","Naruhn S","Meissner W","Adhikary T","Kaddatz K","Klein T","Watzer B","M\u00fcller-Br\u00fcsselbach S","M\u00fcller R"],"doi":"10.1124\/mol.109.060541","first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T12:44:55+00:00","issns":["1521-0111 (Online)","0026-895X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Molecular Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1464784525,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1124\/mol.109.060541","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19903832"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/molpharm.aspetjournals.org\/content\/77\/2\/171.full.pdf","pmid":"19903832","pubdate":"2010-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid is a preferential peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta\/delta agonist.","type":"article","volume":"77","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/15hydroxyeicosatetraenoic-acid-preferential-peroxisome-proliferatoractivated-receptor-betadelta-agon"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7842728,"mean":6.6456077751988,"rank":1924624,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4835296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7842728,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240474,"mean":8.2134088400778,"rank":68496,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":166713,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240474,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1241,"mean":3.0511322580645,"rank":161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":604,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1241,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":1.8181481481481,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
