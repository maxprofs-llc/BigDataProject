Mindfulness is emerging as a helpful treatment for pain, and one study showed that the longitudinal 12\u00a0months' course of CM-MO patients that attended mindfulness-based treatment alone was similar to that of patients receiving medical prophylaxis alone; in this study, we describe the course of biomarkers of inflammation. Our results provide initial evidence of sustained similar effects on reduced concentration of biomarkers of inflammation, although not sizeable enough to reach statistical significance. Whether more intensive treatment and\/or larger samples would lead to greater changes is unknown, but these encouraging preliminary findings suggest further research is warranted.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f610003197","authors":["Licia Grazzi","Domenico D\u2019Amico","Alberto Raggi","Matilde Leonardi","Emilio Ciusani","Elena Corsini","Giovanni D\u2019Andrea","Andrea Bolner","Francisco Salgado-Garc\u00eda","Frank Andrasik","Emanuela Sansone"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10072-017-2874-0","first_seen_on":"2017-09-09T19:09:50+00:00","issns":["1590-1874","1590-3478"],"issue":"Suppl 1","journal":"Neurological Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1504632240,"links":["https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10072-017-2874-0"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10072-017-2874-0.pdf","pmid":"28527073","pubdate":"2017-05-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Milan","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neuroradiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychiatry","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Mindfulness and pharmacological prophylaxis have comparable effect on biomarkers of inflammation and clinical indexes in chronic migraine with medication overuse: results at 12\u00a0months after withdrawal","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mindfulness-pharmacological-prophylaxis-comparable-effect-biomarkers-inflammation-clinical-indexes-c"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366342,"mean":7.0541652571821,"rank":7232237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366342,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112138,"mean":11.843242337498,"rank":90989,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112138,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1035,"mean":3.6704216634429,"rank":720,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1035,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.608,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
