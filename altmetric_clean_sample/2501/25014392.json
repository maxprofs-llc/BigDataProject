The Ki values of dihydroetorphine for the mu-, delta- and kappa-opioid receptors were 4.5 x 10(-10). 1.8 x 10(-9) and 5.7 x 10(-10) M, respectively. On the other hand, those of morphine were 1.9 x 10(-9), 1.4 x 10(-6) and 1.3 x 10(-7) M, respectively. Through all of these three types of opioid receptors, dihydroetorphine inhibited forskolin (10 microM)-stimulated cyclic AMP production via pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein(s), and the inhibitory effects were antagonized by co-application with opioid receptor antagonists. The IC50 values of dihydroetorphine for the inhibition of cyclic AMP production through the mu-, delta- and kappa-opioid receptors were 4.2 x 10(-11), 8.6 x 10(-10) and 4.3 x 10(-9) M. respectively. On the other hand, those of morphine were 2.6 x 10(-8), 2.6 x 10(-6) and 1.9 x 10(-6) M, respectively. These results indicate that dihydroetorphine, unlike morphine which preferentially binds the mu-opioid receptor, binds not only mu- but also delta- and kappa-opioid receptors with high affinity and acts as a more potent agonist than morphine for all of the three types of receptors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000284e","authors":["Katsumata, S","Minami, M","Nakagawa, T","Iwamura, T","Satoh, M"],"first_seen_on":"2017-09-09T18:30:13+00:00","issns":["0014-2999"],"issue":"3","journal":"European Journal of Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1504981808,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8719422"],"pmid":"8719422","pubdate":"1995-11-30T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Pharmacological study of dihydroetorphine in cloned mu-, delta- and kappa-opioid receptors.","type":"article","volume":"291","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pharmacological-study-dihydroetorphine-cloned-mu-delta-kappaopioid-receptors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":3,"1m":3,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8389558,"mean":7.0669301492244,"rank":2152529,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5090878,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8389558,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122619,"mean":11.878519385408,"rank":38067,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":83776,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122619,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2544,"mean":2.8717325992922,"rank":344,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":1209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2544,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":2.2775,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
