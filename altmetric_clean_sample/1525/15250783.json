Although some studies have phenotypically characterized strains of this species, it remains a challenge to determine which factors have a key role in maintaining the abundance of this bacterium in the gut. Besides, phylogenetic analysis has shown that at least two different F. prausnitzii phylogroups can be found within this species and their distribution is different between healthy subjects and patients with gut disorders. It also remains unknown whether or not there are other phylogroups within this species, and also if other Faecalibacterium species exist. Finally, many studies have shown that F. prausnitzii abundance is reduced in different intestinal disorders. It has been proposed that F. prausnitzii monitoring may therefore serve as biomarker to assist in gut diseases diagnostics. In this mini-review, we aim to serve as an overview of F. prausnitzii phylogeny, ecophysiology and diversity. In addition, strategies to modulate the abundance of F. prausnitzii in the gut as well as its application as a biomarker for diagnostics and prognostics of gut diseases are discussed. This species may be a useful potential biomarker to assist in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease discrimination.The ISME Journal advance online publication, 3 January 2017; doi:10.1038\/ismej.2016.176.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52a3cf058f610003f18","authors":["Mireia Lopez-Siles","Sylvia H Duncan","L Jes\u00fas Garcia-Gil","Margarita Martinez-Medina"],"doi":"10.1038\/ismej.2016.176","first_seen_on":"2017-01-05T16:47:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1751-7370","1751-7362"],"journal":"ISME Journal: Multidisciplinary Journal of Microbial Ecology","last_mentioned_on":1484424476,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ismej\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/abs\/ismej2016176a.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ismej\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/ismej2016176a.html"],"pmid":"28045459","pubdate":"2017-01-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied microbiology","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth","microbiology"],"title":"Faecalibacterium prausnitzii: from microbiology to diagnostics and prognostics","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/faecalibacterium-prausnitzii-microbiology-diagnostics-prognostics"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.2,"score_history":{"1y":4.2,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8072166,"mean":6.8521645392475,"rank":1712311,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6349166,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8072166,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":256716,"mean":12.671482546793,"rank":76111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":179935,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":256716,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1512,"mean":11.695819986764,"rank":860,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":651,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1512,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":19.02,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
