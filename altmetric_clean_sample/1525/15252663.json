In this study, the neuroprotective effects of SDS on engineered nerve constructed by Schwann cells (SCs) and Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) were studied in vitro. We further investigated the effect of combinational therapy of SDS and PLGA\/SCs based tissue engineering on peripheral nerve regeneration based on the rat model of nerve injury by sciatic transection. The results showed that SDS dramatically enhanced the proliferation and function of SCs. The underlying mechanism may be that SDS affects SCs growth through the modulation of neurotrophic factors (BDNF, GDNF and CNTF). 12 weeks after implantation with a 12\u2009mm gap of sciatic nerve injury, SDS-PLGA\/SCs achieved satisfying outcomes of nerve regeneration, as evidenced by morphological and functional improvements upon therapy by SDS, PLGA\/SCs or direct suture group assessed by sciatic function index, nerve conduction assay, HE staining and immunohistochemical analysis. Our results demonstrated the significant role of introducing SDS into neural tissue engineering to promote nerve regeneration.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Hui Liu","Peizhen Lv","Yongjia Zhu","Huayu Wu","Kun Zhang","Fuben Xu","Li Zheng","Jinmin Zhao"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep39869","first_seen_on":"2017-01-05T19:24:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1483644279,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep39869?WT.feed_name=subjects_biomedical-engineering&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28054637","pubdate":"2017-01-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Experimental models of disease","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Biomedical engineering","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"39869","subjects":["science"],"title":"Salidroside promotes peripheral nerve regeneration based on tissue engineering strategy using Schwann cells and PLGA: in vitro and in vivo","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/salidroside-promotes-peripheral-nerve-regeneration-based-tissue-engineering-strategy-using-schwann-c"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7987814,"mean":6.7359164730015,"rank":6053639,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1077468,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7987814,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253769,"mean":12.601256076416,"rank":181411,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":44682,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253769,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32324,"mean":14.90926256845,"rank":23703,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":4890,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32324,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3255,"mean":15.733751690227,"rank":2411,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":569,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3255,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
