Several ammosamides have been shown to inhibit quinone reductase 2, a flavoenzyme responsible for quelling toxic oxidative species in cells or for killing cancer cells outright. Treatment of the extract from an ammosamide-producing culture (Streptomyces strain CNR-698) with a thiol-based reagent designed to label electrophilic natural products produced an ammosamide C-thiol adduct. This observation led us to hypothesize, and then demonstrate through experimentation, that all of the other ammosamides are derived from ammosamide C via nonenzymatic processes involving exposure to nucleophiles, air, and light. Like many established electrophilic natural products, reaction with the thiol probe suggests that ammosamide C is itself an electrophilic natural product. Although ammosamide C did not show substantial cytotoxicity against cancer cells, its activity against a marine Bacillus bacterial strain may reflect its ecological role.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d8b","authors":["Daniela Reimer"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jnatprod.6b00773","first_seen_on":"2017-01-05T21:42:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-6025"],"journal":"Journal of Natural Products","last_mentioned_on":1483652538,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jnatprod.6b00773"],"pmid":"28055208","pubdate":"2017-01-06T22:02:19+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Thiol-Based Probe for Electrophilic Natural Products Reveals That Most of the Ammosamides Are Artifacts","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/thiolbased-probe-electrophilic-natural-products-reveals-most-ammosamides-artifacts"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7987814,"mean":6.7359164730015,"rank":4193527,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2231739,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7987814,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253769,"mean":12.601286222061,"rank":142760,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":86552,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253769,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1595,"mean":3.9553989962359,"rank":979,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":408,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1595,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":13.64023255814,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
