A profound neutropenia and pancytopenia were identified. Bone marrow aspirates revealed neutrophilic hyperplasia, a significant left shift, and toxic changes, suggesting immune-mediated destruction as a likely underlying mechanism. Immunosuppressive therapy was instituted and clinical signs improved.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dc5","authors":["Denstedt, Ellen B"],"first_seen_on":"2017-01-05T18:26:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0008-5286"],"issue":"1","journal":"The Canadian Veterinary Journal","last_mentioned_on":1483578661,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28042161"],"pmcid":"PMC5157745","pmid":"28042161","pubdate":"2017-01-06T22:37:47+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Suspected immune-mediated neutropenia and corticosteroid responsive pancytopenia in a Portuguese water dog.","type":"article","volume":"58"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7987814,"mean":6.7359164730015,"rank":6910355,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7987814,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253768,"mean":12.601286030098,"rank":209078,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253768,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":673,"mean":2.2047232142857,"rank":443,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":673,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.51428571428571,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Suspected immune-mediated neutropenia and corticosteroid responsive pancytopenia in a Portuguese water dog. - PubMed - NCBI","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=582187178643134&id=187782961416893","license":"public","citation_ids":[15251953],"posted_on":"2017-01-05T01:11:01+00:00","summary":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28042161","author":{"name":"Institute of Canine Biology","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/187782961416893","facebook_wall_name":"Institute of Canine Biology","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/187782961416893\/picture","id_on_source":"187782961416893"}}]}}
