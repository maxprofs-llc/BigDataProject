The growth mechanism of Mo2C NCs with atomic H treatment is discussed. The Mo2C-GNR hybrid exhibits highly active and durable electrocatalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). For HER, in an acidic solution the Mo2C-GNR has an onset potential of 39 mV and a Tafel slope of 65 mV dec(-1), in a basic solution Mo2C-GNR has an onset potential of 53 mV, and Tafel slope of 54 mV dec(-1). It is stable in both acidic and basic media. Mo2C-GNR is a high activity ORR catalyst with a high peak current density of 2.01 mA cm(-2), an onset potential of 0.94 V that is more positive vs reversible hydrogen electrode, a high electron transfer number n (\u223c3.86) and long-term stability.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006816","authors":["Xiujun Fan","Yuanyue Liu","Zhiwei Peng","Zhenhua Zhang","Haiqing Zhou","Xianming Zhang","Boris I.
