In this study, we designed a new dermal substitute from human placentas for full-thickness wound healing. Highly porous, decellularized ECM sheets were fabricated from human placentas via homogenization, centrifugation, chemical and enzymatic treatments, molding, and freeze-drying. The physical structure and biological composition of human placenta-derived ECM sheets dramatically supported the regeneration of full-thickness wound in vivo. At the early stage, the ECM sheet efficiently absorbed wound exudates and tightly attached to the wound surface. Four weeks after implantation, the wound was completely closed, epidermic cells were well arranged and the bilayer structure of the epidermis and dermis was restored. Moreover, hair follicles and microvessels were newly formed in the ECM sheet-implanted wounds. Overall, the ECM sheet produced a dermal substitute with similar cellular organization to that of normal skin. These results suggest that human placenta-derived ECM sheets provide a microenvironment favorable to the growth and differentiation of cells, and positive modulate the healing of full-thickness wounds.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008b9b","authors":["Choi JS","Kim JD","Yoon HS","Cho YW"],"doi":"10.1089\/ten.tea.2011.0738","first_seen_on":"2015-01-29T18:30:30+00:00","issns":["1937-3341"],"issue":"","journal":"Tissue Engineering: Part A","last_mentioned_on":1422548442,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22891853"],"pmid":"22891853","pubdate":"2012-08-16T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["histology","biotechnology"],"title":"Full-Thickness Skin Wound Healing Using Human Placenta-Derived Extracellular Matrix Containing Bioactive Molecules.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fullthickness-skin-wound-healing-using-human-placentaderived-extracellular-matrix-containing-bioacti-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4689255,"mean":5.7073978210593,"rank":3928274,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4689255,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163391,"mean":8.7406171613933,"rank":131110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163391,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":668,"mean":2.3597061469265,"rank":602,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":668,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":3.5037272727273,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
