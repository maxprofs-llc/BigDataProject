The investigated group consisted of 25 patients with OCD (12 male, 13 female) aged 17-47 (mean 29 +\/- 9) years, duration of illness was 1-15 (mean 4 +\/- 2) years. After treatment with sertraline, a significant improvement in OCD symptoms measured by YBOCS and in neuropsychological \"frontal\" tests were observed. Little correlation was found between the effect of sertraline on OCD symptoms and on cognitive dysfunctions. This may suggest that these two effects may be connected with different pharmacological properties of the drug. The effect of sertraline on OCD symptoms, similarly like other drugs inhibiting serotonin transporter (clomipramine, other SSRI) is associated with its influence on serotonergic system. On the other hand, the effect of sertraline on dopaminergic neurotransmission may be related to its favorable action on cognitive functions connected with the activity of frontal lobe.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fd3cf058f610006043","authors":["Alina Borkowska","Ewa Pilaczy\u0144ska","Aleksander Araszkiewicz","Janusz Rybakowski"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-29T18:24:36+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0033-2674"],"issue":"6 Suppl","journal":"Psychiatria Polska","last_mentioned_on":1400944655,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12647451"],"pmid":"12647451","pubdate":"2002-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"[The effect of sertraline on cognitive functions in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder].","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-sertraline-cognitive-functions-patients-obsessivecompulsive-disorder-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3803844,"mean":5.0143113162989,"rank":870432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2403477,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3803844,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114784,"mean":8.8718188930417,"rank":33501,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":79959,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114784,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122,"mean":1.6214049586777,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":94,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":2.25,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Psychology":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Antidepressant","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=579578895#altmetric_citation_228","license":"public","citation_ids":[3141667],"posted_on":"2013-10-31T07:01:15+00:00","summary":"Antidepressants are drugs used for the treatment of major depressive disorder and other conditions, including dysthymia, anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, eating disorders, chronic pain, neuropathic pain and, in some cases, dysmenorrhoea, s","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=2388","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Fuse809","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Fuse809"}},{"title":"Sertraline","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=609953110#altmetric_citation_168","license":"public","citation_ids":[3141667],"posted_on":"2014-05-24T15:17:35+00:00","summary":"Sertraline (trade names Zoloft, Lustral) is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=149612","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Boghog","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Boghog"}}]}}
