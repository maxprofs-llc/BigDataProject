While very flexible, their design based on consumer electronics can limit their value in vision research. Here their limitations of resolution in time, space, intensity and wavelength are systematically compiled. Often, ingenious ideas can circumvent such limitations for specific experiments. Some ad-hoc solutions, as well as the more general techniques of dithering and anti-aliasing, are presented.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f61000359e","authors":["M Bach","T Meigen","H Strasburger","Bach, M","Meigen, T","Strasburger, H"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-29T19:45:08+00:00","issns":["0169-1015"],"issue":"4","journal":"Spatial Vision","last_mentioned_on":1478675814,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9176948","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9176948"],"pmid":"9176948","pubdate":"1997-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Physical Sciences","Psychology","Computer Science"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Raster-scan cathode-ray tubes for vision research--limits of resolution in space, time and intensity, and some solutions.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rasterscan-cathoderay-tubes-vision-researchlimits-resolution-space-time-intensity-some-solutions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8367780,"mean":7.0550645326482,"rank":2145269,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5081047,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8367780,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243975,"mean":8.2077972816776,"rank":69773,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":168188,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243975,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":2.7173684210526,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":9,"Researcher":17,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
