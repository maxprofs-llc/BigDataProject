It involves multiple systems, is an increasing problem in elderly populations, and is strongly associated with increases in both morbidity and mortality. Despite its recognition clinically, the frailty syndrome is not often identified in forensic situations and is only infrequently mentioned in the associated literature. As there is a direct relationship between the frailty syndrome and significant adverse health outcomes the syndrome has clear medicolegal significance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5f53cf058f610005e6e","authors":["Roger W Byard","Roger W.
