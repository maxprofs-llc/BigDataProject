Studies were conducted to understand ORO entry in HeLa cells. Chlorpromazine inhibited early steps of ORO replication cycle, consistent with entry\/uncoating. The data indicate that ORO enters HeLa cells by clathrin-coated vesicles, by a mechanism susceptible to endosomal acidification inhibitors. Transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescence indicated that ORO associates with clathrin-coated pits and can be found in association with late endosomes in a time shorter than 1h.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003708","authors":["Santos RI","Rodrigues AH","Silva ML","Mortara RA","Rossi MA","Jamur MC","Oliver C","Arruda E"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.virusres.2008.08.016","first_seen_on":"2015-01-29T18:25:31+00:00","issns":["0168-1702"],"issue":"1-2","journal":"Virus Research","last_mentioned_on":1333680307,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.virusres.2008.08.016","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18840482"],"pmid":"18840482","pubdate":"2008-10-08T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Oropouche virus entry into HeLa cells involves clathrin and requires endosomal acidification.","type":"article","volume":"138","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/oropouche-virus-entry-hela-cells-involves-clathrin-requires-endosomal-acidification"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4800224,"mean":5.7435569789187,"rank":1166821,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3043304,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4800224,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170574,"mean":8.541406095924,"rank":49540,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":118809,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170574,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":710,"mean":1.9080818053597,"rank":80,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":515,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":710,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":1.203,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
