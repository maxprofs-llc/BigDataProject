We sought to examine whether hyperinsulinaemia increases IL-6 mRNA in skeletal muscle and whether any increase is modified in insulin resistant muscle. We hypothesized that intramuscular IL-6 mRNA would be increased in response to insulin, but such an affect would be unaffected by insulin resistance because the primary insulin sensitive signalling protein responsible for activating IL-6 functions normally in insulin resistant muscle. Transgenic rats over-expressing the gluconeogenic regulatory enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) were studied. White gastrocnemius muscle samples were obtained under hyperinsulinaemic, euglycaemic clamp (4 mU kg(-1)min(-1) insulin, plasma glucose concentration 4-6 mmol L(-1)) and basal conditions in both PEPCK (basal n=4; insulin n=5) and wild-type (CON) (basal n=5; insulin n=4) rats, which were previously injected with a bolus of 2-[1-14C]deoxyglucose (2-DG) into the carotid artery. Muscle samples were assayed for 2-DG uptake and IL-6 mRNA. No differences in 2-DG uptake or IL-6 mRNA were observed when comparing groups under basal conditions. Under clamp conditions, 2-DG uptake was lower (P<0.05) in PEPCK compared with CON. Insulin stimulation in CON did not change IL-6 mRNA compared with basal levels. In contrast, there was an approximately 8-fold increase (P<0.05) in IL-6 mRNA in insulin-stimulated PEPCK compared with CON basal levels. Insulin stimulation increases IL-6 gene expression in insulin resistant, but not healthy, skeletal muscle, suggesting that IL-6 expression in skeletal muscle is sensitive to changes in insulin in circumstances of insulin resistance. It is likely that the differences observed when comparing healthy with insulin resistant muscle are due to the differential activation of insulin sensitive signalling proteins responsible for activating IL-6.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","authors":["A.L Carey","B Lamont","S Andrikopoulos","I Koukoulas","J Proietto","M.A Febbraio","Carey, A L","Lamont, B","Andrikopoulos, S","Koukoulas, I","Proietto, J","Febbraio, M A"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0006-291x(03)00267-5","endpage":"840","first_seen_on":"2015-01-29T18:55:33+00:00","issns":["0006-291X","0006291X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1478901340,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12646246","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0006-291X(03)00267-5","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12646246"],"pmid":"12646246","pubdate":"2003-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"837","subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Interleukin-6 gene expression is increased in insulin-resistant rat skeletal muscle following insulin stimulation","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0006291X03002675","volume":"302","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interleukin6-gene-expression-increased-insulinresistant-rat-skeletal-muscle-following-insulin-stimul-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7679268,"mean":6.5932591477757,"rank":1867647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4790097,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7679268,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238369,"mean":7.9902219425427,"rank":66589,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":166948,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238369,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8183,"mean":2.7219506233195,"rank":587,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":3197,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8183,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201,"mean":2.50763,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":173,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Arsenic poisoning","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=749024951#altmetric_citation_d1d7f8bb-f5d1-42f8-9b8c-e4f81ed06c7e","license":"public","citation_ids":[3144472,3144472],"posted_on":"2016-11-11T21:55:40+00:00","summary":"Arsenic poisoning is a medical condition that occurs due to elevated levels of arsenic in the body.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=85490","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Doc James","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Doc James"}}]}}
