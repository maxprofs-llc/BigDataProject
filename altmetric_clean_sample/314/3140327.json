During a 20-year study period, 626 children were born in Aberdeen to mothers taking antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The study examined long-term effects of prenatal exposure to AEDs in 260 children (122 males, 138 females). Of these, 26 (16 males) were reported by parents to have social or behavioural difficulties. Eleven children (6 males, 5 females) fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for autistic disorder and one (female) fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for AS. These children comprised 4.6% of the exposed children studied, and 1.9% of all exposed children born during the study period. Mean age of these children at diagnosis was 5 years 4 months (SD 2y 11mo) and 9 years 10 months (SD 3y 10mo) at the time of this study. Other children from the group of 26 had difficulties in areas of speech and language development and social communication but did not meet the criteria for an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Sodium valproate was the drug most commonly associated with autistic disorder, five of 56 (8.9%) of the study children exposed to sodium valproate alone had either autistic disorder or AS. It was concluded that prenatal exposure to anticonvulsant medication is a risk factor for the development of an ASD. Fetal anticonvulsant syndrome associated autistic disorder is characterized by an even sex ratio, absence of regression or skill loss, and language delay in the absence of global delay.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026f3","authors":["Rasalam AD","Hailey H","Williams JH","Moore SJ","Turnpenny PD","Lloyd DJ","Dean JC"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-29T18:08:54+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"8","journal":"Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1434365485,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16108456"],"pmid":"16108456","pubdate":"2005-08-20T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology","pediatrics"],"title":"Characteristics of fetal anticonvulsant syndrome associated autistic disorder.","type":"article","volume":"47","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characteristics-fetal-anticonvulsant-syndrome-associated-autistic-disorder"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.136,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.136},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7418995,"mean":6.4507258833167,"rank":894347,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":6524327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7418995,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235931,"mean":7.9493689823254,"rank":35494,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":200437,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235931,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1624,"mean":3.2779445471349,"rank":104,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":1520,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1624,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":5.2966363636364,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":9,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":21,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
