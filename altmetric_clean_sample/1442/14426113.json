The client, Harry, is a 32-year-old man who was treated for self-injurious behavior (SIB) ten years ago with a multiphased program that included a) reinforcement with physical restraint for increasingly longer periods of noninjury and timeout from restraint for SIB, b) fading restraint, c) substituting appropriate forms of restraint, d) token reinforcement for adaptive behavior, and e) parent and vocational training. After ten years Harry's SIB remains infrequent and rarely results in any tissue damage. No negative consequences have been used for his SIB for over nine years. Harry now works all day in a community workshop, earns approximately $45.00 per month, visits his parents' home virtually every weekend and accompanied them two years ago on a four and a half week vacation by car that covered 7500 miles. Conceptual and practical considerations related to the client's success are discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003464","authors":["Foxx, R M"],"first_seen_on":"2016-12-04T00:00:31+00:00","issns":["0891-4222"],"issue":"1","journal":"Research in Developmental Disabilities","last_mentioned_on":1480809617,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2300687"],"pmid":"2300687","pubdate":"1990-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Specialist Studies In Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"\"Harry\": a ten year follow-up of the successful treatment of a self-injurious man.","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/harry-ten-year-followup-successful-treatment-selfinjurious-man"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336514,"mean":7.0288438396164,"rank":6326331,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1128664,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336514,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278181,"mean":12.011547925803,"rank":192876,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":52926,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278181,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1437,"mean":3.2040988857939,"rank":941,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":344,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1437,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":4.8203846153846,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
