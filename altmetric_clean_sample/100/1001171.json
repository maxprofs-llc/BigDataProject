However, many aspects of CoV behavior, including modes of its transmission, are yet to be fully understood. We show that the amount and the peculiarities of distribution of the protein intrinsic disorder in the viral shell can be used for the efficient analysis of the behavior and transmission modes of CoV. The proposed model allows categorization of the various CoVs by the peculiarities of disorder distribution in their membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). This categorization enables quick identification of viruses with similar behaviors in transmission, regardless of genetic proximity. Based on this analysis, an empirical model for predicting the viral transmission behavior is developed. This model is able to explain some behavioral aspects of important coronaviruses that previously were not fully understood. The new predictor can be a useful tool for better epidemiological, clinical, and structural understanding of behavior of both newly emerging viruses and viruses that have been known for a long time. A potentially new vaccine strategy could involve searches for viral strains that are characterized by the evolutionary misfit between the peculiarities of the disorder distribution in their shells and their behavior.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dc6","authors":["Uversky, Vladimir N."],"doi":"10.1155\/2012\/738590","first_seen_on":"2012-10-15T01:42:05+00:00","issns":["2090-3057"],"journal":"Journal of Pathogens","last_mentioned_on":1350265765,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/jpath\/2012\/738590\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/jpath\/2012\/738590.pdf","pmid":"23097708","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","title":"Understanding Viral Transmission Behavior via Protein Intrinsic Disorder Prediction: Coronaviruses","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/understanding-viral-transmission-behavior-via-protein-intrinsic-disorder-prediction-coronaviruses"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629536,"mean":4.93415564694,"rank":2900979,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":78066,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629536,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77278,"mean":5.181215523377,"rank":57453,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":389,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77278,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":2.3814117647059,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
