We compared the pneumonia admission rate (number of cases per 1,000 population) 2 years before and 2 years after the introduction of PCV7 in 2006. Only children with radiologically confirmed pneumonia were analyzed. The vaccination rate in the analyzed periods was around 99%. In the period preceding the implementation of PCV7, the average pneumonia admission rate was 41.48\/1,000 and 6.15\/1,000 for 1-year-old and 2-4-year-old children, respectively. Statistical analysis showed a significant fall in this rate in two consecutive years after PCV7 implementation (p < 0.0000001 for 1-year-old and p = 0.011 for 2-4-year-old children, respectively). In the first year of vaccination, the admission number decreased in these two groups by about 65 and 23%, respectively. In the second year, only a few percent fall in the admission rate was noted. In children younger than 2 years of age, the age group targeted for vaccination, pneumonia-related healthcare utilization declined substantially following PCV7 introduction. These results suggest that PCV7 may play an important role in reducing the burden of pneumonia in Poland.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002828","authors":["Patrza\u0142ek M","Albrecht P","Sobczynski M"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10096-010-0928-9","first_seen_on":"2012-10-17T14:17:47+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"European Journal of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1349194584,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20437068?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pmid":"20437068","pubdate":"2010-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology","communicablediseases"],"title":"Significant decline in pneumonia admission rate after the introduction of routine 2+1 dose schedule heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) in children under 5 years of age in Kielce, Poland.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/significant-decline-pneumonia-admission-rate-after-introduction-routine-21-dose-schedule-heptavalent"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632299,"mean":4.9243828402896,"rank":2898221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":81255,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632299,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78248,"mean":5.1740585837157,"rank":58142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":464,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78248,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":490,"mean":1.8706789366053,"rank":363,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":490,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.0571428571429,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
