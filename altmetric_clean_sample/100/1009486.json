The Pleth Variability Index (PVI) is an oximeter-derived parameter. It allows a continuous monitoring of the respiratory variation of the perfusion index.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5233cf058f610003b2e","authors":["Forget P","Lois F","Kartheuser A","Leonard D","Remue C","De Kock M"],"first_seen_on":"2012-10-18T20:03:17+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Current Clinical Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1383044742,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/23061978\/?i=2&from=Forget+p","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23061978?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23061978","pubdate":"2012-10-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"The Concept of Titration can be Transposed to Fluid Management.
