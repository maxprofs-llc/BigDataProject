The sign and the magnitude of proton-proton coupling constants are measured along the direct dimension from the relative E.COSY-type multiplet pattern displacement due to the passive one-bond coupling constant splitting generated in the indirect dimension. On the other hand, long-range proton-carbon coupling constants are independently determined in the detected dimension from a traditional fitting analysis of antiphase multiplet patterns or, more conveniently, from the IPAP multiplet displacement obtained from extended HSQMBC experiments.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e26","authors":["Josep Saur\u00ed","Pau Nolis","Laura Casta\u00f1ar","Albert Virgili","Teodor Parella"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jmr.2012.09.007","endpage":"106","first_seen_on":"2012-10-15T08:00:09+00:00","issns":["10907807"],"journal":"Journal of Magnetic Resonance","last_mentioned_on":1350287999,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1090780712003060"],"pmid":"23069350","pubdate":"2012-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"101","title":"P.E.HSQMBC: Simultaneous measurement of proton\u2013proton and proton\u2013carbon coupling constants","type":"article","volume":"224","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pehsqmbc-simultaneous-measurement-protonproton-protoncarbon-coupling-constants"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632750,"mean":4.9231796234803,"rank":2015194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":945854,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632750,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77301,"mean":5.1694876584735,"rank":37140,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":27265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77301,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278,"mean":1.1369602888087,"rank":66,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":163,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.1,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
