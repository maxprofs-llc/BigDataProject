In malignant astrocytoma cells, it was reported that NF-kappaB was activated aberrantly and promoted their proliferation. Thus, inhibition of NF-kappaB activity is considered to be a promising therapeutic strategy for malignant astrocytoma. Recently, curcumin, the major constituent of turmeric, was reported to inhibit NF-kappaB activity. In this study, we investigated inhibitory effects of curcumin on NF-kappaB activity and cellular proliferation, and induction of apoptosis by curcumin in human malignant astrocytoma cell lines. Alteration of NF-kappaB activity in NP-2 human malignant astrocytoma cell line after treatment with curcumin was examined using electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Alterations of DNA synthesis and cellular growth in five human malignant astrocytoma cell lines after treatment with curcumin were examined using [(3)H]thymidine incorporation assay and the trypan blue dye exclusion method, respectively. Induction of apoptosis by curcumin in NP-2 and NP-3 human malignant astrocytoma cell lines was examined by DNA-fragmentation analysis and morphological observation. We found that the NF-kappaB activity in NP-2 was significantly reduced by curcumin. The DNA synthesis and the cellular growth were inhibited by curcumin in dose-dependent manner in all the five malignant astrocytoma cell lines. Nuclear condensation and fragmentation, and DNA fragmentation were observed in both NP-2 and NP-3 after the treatment with curcumin. These results indicate that curcumin inhibits the cellular proliferation and induces apoptosis in human malignant astrocytoma cell lines. These results are considered to be resulted from the inhibition of NF-kappaB activity by curcumin.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d8f","authors":["Nagai S","Kurimoto M","Washiyama K","Hirashima Y","Kumanishi T","Endo S"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11060-004-5757-1","first_seen_on":"2012-10-16T06:33:28+00:00","issns":["0167-594X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Neuro-Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1350660346,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16193380"],"pmid":"16193380","pubdate":"2005-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms","neurology"],"title":"Inhibition of cellular proliferation and induction of apoptosis by curcumin in human malignant astrocytoma cell lines.","type":"article","volume":"74","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inhibition-cellular-proliferation-induction-apoptosis-curcumin-human-malignant-astrocytoma-cell-line"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":1975631,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3029374,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83897,"mean":5.80314186612,"rank":26407,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":56876,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83897,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":815,"mean":1.9824889434889,"rank":184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":628,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":815,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.3636363636364,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
