This study aims to appraise the 'value for money' of PCV-7 vaccination programme from the societal perspective and the budget impact from the perspective of municipalities, which is responsible for providing routine vaccination. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis with Markov modelling and calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) value of launching such programme with two levels of co-payment, \u00a51000 (US$13) or \u00a50, and two scenarios of the uptake of vaccine (vaccinated-alone or co-vaccinated with other vaccines). We found that when vaccinated-alone, ICERs in QALY were \u00a57,441,000 (US$93,013) or \u00a59,065,000 (US$113,313), and when co-vaccinated \u00a57,441,000 (US$93,013) or \u00a55,489,000 (US$68,613), without or with productivity loss, respectively, regardless of co-payment level of the programme. Co-vaccinated programmes had lower ICER than vaccinated-alone programmes due to the savings in productivity loss. By adopting WHO's classification that an intervention is 'cost-effective' if ICER (in QALY) is between 1 and 3 times of GDP as a criterion, PCV-7 vaccination programme in Japan is concluded as \"cost-effective\" from the perspective of society. The introduction of either no co-payment or \u00a51000 (US$13) co-payment vaccination programme appears to be not budget saving for the first 6 years, whereas the level of budget impact are less than \u00a511,000,000 (US$137,500) or \u00a58,500,000 (US$106,250), respectively, for a municipality with 1000 birth cohort in the 1st year and 2nd to 5th year birth cohort proportional to the birth cohort population of estimated future population.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036ea","authors":["Hoshi SL","Kondo M","Okubo I"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.vaccine.2012.02.033","first_seen_on":"2012-10-17T14:16:15+00:00","issns":["0264-410X"],"issue":"","journal":"Vaccine","last_mentioned_on":1349195065,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22386745?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pmid":"22386745","pubdate":"2012-03-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Veterinary","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Economic evaluation of vaccination programme of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to the birth cohort in Japan.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/economic-evaluation-vaccination-programme-7valent-pneumococcal-conjugate-vaccine-birth-cohort-japan-6"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631865,"mean":4.925550910502,"rank":2898485,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":80926,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631865,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78245,"mean":5.1748764378099,"rank":58148,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":464,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78245,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2427,"mean":4.8381269579555,"rank":1869,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2427,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86,"mean":2.9138117647059,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
