The classification of these manifestations published in 1999 has harmonized the definitions cases used in the studies but did not help the clinician to positively identify a specific manifestation of lupus or a neurological or psychiatric event occurred independently of the disease. Published cases series help us to identify neurological or psychiatric manifestations of lupus but modern diagnosis tools contribution have to be evaluated in order to optimize diagnosis management of such manifestations and to distinguish specific events related to lupus and independent manifestations. In this second part of our literature review about neuropsychiatric lupus, we propose to identify arguments, which could be in favor of lupus responsibility in front of a neurological or psychiatric event, and immunosuppressive treatments which are recommended.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003495","authors":["Lef\u00e8vre G","Z\u00e9phir H","Michelin E","Semah F","Warembourg F","Pruvo JP","Hachulla E","Lenfant P","Dubucquoi S","Vermersch P","Hatron PY","Prin L","Launay D"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.revmed.2012.03.354","first_seen_on":"2012-10-16T15:35:09+00:00","issns":["0248-8663","02488663"],"journal":"Revue de Medecine Interne","last_mentioned_on":1350332759,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0248866312004511"],"pmid":"22578589","pubdate":"2012-05-16T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["internalmedicine"],"title":"Neurolupus (2e\u00a0partie).
