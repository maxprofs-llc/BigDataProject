Participants (105 females and 66 males) who had undergone surgery under the care of a single surgeon were included in the review and were grouped according to their preoperative BMI into nonobese (BMI < 30\u2009kg\/m(2)), (n = 73) obese (BMI \u2265 30\u2009kg\/m(2)) (n = 98). Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and Short Form 12 scores (SF12) were taken preoperatively and 6 and 12 months after surgery to analyse differences between groups in the absolute scores as well as changes from before to after surgery. Preoperatively, the obese group had a significantly poorer OKS compared to non obese (44.7 versus 41.2, P = 0.003). There were no statistically significant group effects on follow-up or change scores of the OKS and SF12. Correlations coefficients between BMI and follow-up and change scores were low (r < 0.201). There were no significant differences in the number of complications and revisions (local wound infection, 6.7% non obese, 11% obese, postoperative systemic complication, 8% non obese, 12% obese, revision, 4% nonobese, 3% obese). In conclusion, our findings indicate similar degrees of benefits from the surgery irrespective of patient BMI.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51b3cf058f61000393f","authors":["Mercer, Thomas H."],"doi":"10.1155\/2012\/185208","first_seen_on":"2012-10-17T12:49:10+00:00","issns":["2090-1984"],"journal":"Arthritis (20901984)","last_mentioned_on":1352336401,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/arth\/2012\/185208\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/arth\/2012\/185208.pdf","pmid":"23119158","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","title":"The Influence of Obesity on Patient Reported Outcomes following Total Knee Replacement","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-obesity-patient-reported-outcomes-following-total-knee-replacement-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630432,"mean":4.9299514944696,"rank":2741698,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":730867,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630432,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78233,"mean":5.1741326055834,"rank":52764,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":20061,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78233,"percentile":25},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":2.1825581395349,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":2.15,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Sports and Recreations":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"The Influence of Obesity on Patient Reported Outco...
