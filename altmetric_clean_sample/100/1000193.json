The metal oxido clusters are regarded as ideal precursors for \u03b2-Bi(2)O(3) due to their structural relationship with the latter. Nevertheless, different bismuth oxide polymorphs are accessible dependent on the hydrolysis protocol. Hydrolysis over a period of 18 h gave stable \u03b1-Bi(2)O(3) whereas after 3 min an amorphous material is observed. Annealing of the amorphous material at 370 \u00b0C gave nanoscaled \u03b2-Bi(2)O(3). An unusual high reactivity of the \u03b2-Bi(2)O(3) particles with SiO(2) and Al(2)O(3) is observed at temperatures above 400 \u00b0C. Powder X-ray diffraction studies, transmission electron microscopy, diffuse reflectance UV\/Vis spectroscopy and nitrogen adsorption measurements are used for characterization of the as-prepared \u03b2-Bi(2)O(3) nanoparticles. The properties of the \u03b2-Bi(2)O(3) nanoparticles depend on the starting bismuth oxido clusters with regard to particle size and optical band gap. The \u03b2-Bi(2)O(3) nanoparticles show excellent photocatalytic activity as demonstrated by dye decomposition (rhodamine B, methyl orange, methylene blue and orange G) under visible light.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Maik Schlesinger","Steffen Schulze","Michael Hietschold","Michael Mehring"],"doi":"10.1039\/c2dt32119j","endpage":"1056","first_seen_on":"2012-10-14T00:13:10+00:00","issns":["1477-9234","1477-9226"],"issue":"4","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1351911662,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlelanding\/2012\/dt\/c2dt32119j","http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2013\/DT\/C2DT32119J"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2012\/dt\/c2dt32119j","pmid":"23108196","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1047","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Metastable \u00ce\u00b2-Bi2O3 nanoparticles with High Photocatalytic Activity from Polynuclear Bismuth Oxido Clusters","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metastable-%CE%B2bi-sub2sub-o-sub3sub-nanoparticles-high-photocatalytic-activity-polynuclear-bismuth-oxid"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":3543927,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":136042,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80271,"mean":5.4900744985673,"rank":62277,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":673,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80271,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7985,"mean":1.0186788577154,"rank":5434,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7985,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1.25,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Materials Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/InorganicNews\/statuses\/257272764652736513","license":"public","citation_ids":[1000193],"posted_on":"2012-10-14T00:13:01+00:00","author":{"name":"Inorganic News","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1636129253\/DSC01061_2_normal.JPG","description":"News, comments and publications about Inorganic Chemistry.","id_on_source":"InorganicNews","tweeter_id":"411132501","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1297},"tweet_id":"257272764652736513"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/InorganicNews\/statuses\/264562803858341888","license":"public","citation_ids":[1000193],"posted_on":"2012-11-03T03:01:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Inorganic News","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1636129253\/DSC01061_2_normal.JPG","description":"News, comments and publications about Inorganic Chemistry.","id_on_source":"InorganicNews","tweeter_id":"411132501","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1297},"tweet_id":"264562803858341888"}]}}
