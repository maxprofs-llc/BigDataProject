The mitochondrial electron transfer chains play a major role in the production of ATP, and the generation and management of reactive oxidative stress (ROS). This paper is a systematic review of the role of the mitochondrial electron transport chain in autism, and a consequent hypothesis for treating autism is synthesized. An electronic search with pre-specified inclusion criteria was conducted in order to retrieve all the published articles about the mitochondrial electron transport chain in autism. The two databases of PUBMED and Google Scholar were searched. From one hundred twenty five retrieved titles, 12 (three case control study and 9 case reports) articles met inclusion criteria. All of the included studies indicated dysfunction of electron transport chain in autism. The mitochondrial electron transfer chain seems impaired in some children with autism and ROS production is additionally enhanced. It is hypothesized that interventions involving alternative electron shuttling may improve autism through lowering the production of ROS. In addition, it is expected that this alternative electron shuttling to cytochrome c might enhance the production of ATP which is impaired in the disorder.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5063cf058f6100030f3","authors":["Ghanizadeh A","Berk M","Farrashbandi H","Alavi Shoushtari A","Villagonzalo KA","Ahmad Ghanizadeh","Michael Berk","Hassan Farrashbandi","Ali Alavi shoushtari","Kristi-Ann Villagonzalo"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.mito.2012.10.001","endpage":"519","first_seen_on":"2012-10-16T08:41:20+00:00","handle":"11343\/43872","handles":["11343\/43872"],"issns":["1872-8278","1567-7249","15677249"],"issue":"5","journal":"Mitochondrion","last_mentioned_on":1350387910,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23063712","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.mito.2012.10.001","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.mito.2012.10.001"],"pmid":"23063712","pubdate":"2012-10-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"515","subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Targeting the mitochondrial electron transport chain in autism, a systematic review and synthesis of a novel therapeutic approach.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S156772491200222X","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/targeting-mitochondrial-electron-transport-chain-autism-systematic-review-synthesis-novel-therapeuti-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4897807,"mean":5.8216879933617,"rank":2576008,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":2299497,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4897807,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83064,"mean":5.7564057402213,"rank":39087,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":43589,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83064,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":225,"mean":2.7004553571429,"rank":86,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":225,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.34375,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
