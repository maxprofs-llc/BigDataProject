In particular, structure-based peptide design can be used to identify and optimize peptide ligands. Successful structure-based design, in turn, requires accurate and fast methods for predicting protein-peptide binding affinities. Here, we review the development of such methods, emphasizing structure-based methods that assume rigid-body association and the single-structure approximation. We also briefly review recent applications of computational free energy prediction methods to enable and guide novel peptide drug and biomarker discovery. We close the review with a brief perspective on the future of computational, structure-based protein-peptide binding affinity prediction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024e1","authors":["Audie, Joseph","Swanson, Jon"],"doi":"10.1111\/cbdd.12076","endpage":"60","first_seen_on":"2012-10-15T18:29:04+00:00","issns":["1747-0285","1747-0277"],"issue":"1","journal":"Chemical Biology & Drug Design","last_mentioned_on":1350325738,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cbdd.12076\/abstract;jsessionid=AF0BCADA96E57C04E497C97480882665.d01t02"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cbdd.12076\/pdf","pmid":"23066895","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"50","subjects":["pharmacology","biochemistry"],"title":"Advances in the prediction of protein\u00e2\u0080\u0090peptide binding affinities: implications for peptide\u00e2\u0080\u0090based drug discovery","type":"article","volume":"81","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/advances-prediction-proteinpeptide-binding-affinities-implications-peptidebased-drug-discovery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6709003,"mean":6.1618098286434,"rank":4970662,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":978706,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6709003,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97923,"mean":5.6329422601663,"rank":62433,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":19639,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97923,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":782,"mean":1.6480819462228,"rank":383,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":782,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.75,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
