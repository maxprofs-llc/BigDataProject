Muscles loose their adaptive capacity, undergoing atrophy or wasting, due to a number of pathological insults. Metabolic changes, such as those occurring during aging, contribute to the progressive reduction of myofiber size and decline of skeletal muscle performance that is typically observed in the elderly. The nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 has been involved in the protection against metabolic disorders, against cancers and in the enhancement of life span. Here we discuss the current evidence placing SIRT1 at the crossroad between energy homeostasis, fiber strength, and regeneration from damage in the skeletal muscle. Furthermore, we underline how cell type specific targeting of SIRT1 could be beneficial in the treatment of skeletal muscle diseases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a7","authors":["Tonkin J","Villarroya F","Puri PL","Vinciguerra M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.coph.2012.02.010","first_seen_on":"2012-10-13T20:51:34+00:00","issns":["1471-4892"],"issue":"","journal":"Current Opinion in Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1352735344,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22401932\/"],"pmid":"22401932","pubdate":"2012-03-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"SIRT1 signaling as potential modulator of skeletal muscle diseases.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sirt1-signaling-potential-modulator-skeletal-muscle-diseases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4714189,"mean":5.6961538822827,"rank":3158881,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1371255,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4714189,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81697,"mean":5.7387636603995,"rank":49924,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":28202,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81697,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":356,"mean":2.7112056338028,"rank":232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":356,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.0730769230769,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
