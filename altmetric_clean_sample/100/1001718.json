Congenital hypopituitarism is also a rare condition; thus, the association of the two entities is unlikely to be casual. We describe one pediatric case of agenesis of the internal carotid artery with hypopituitarism and review other known cases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be1","authors":["D.
