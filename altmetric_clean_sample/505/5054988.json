The response included the establishment of a regional and national monitoring unit, an information program aimed at health professionals concerned and public opinion, the involvement of health and entomology teams for the detection and census of potential larval habitats and the implementation of local mosquito eradication measures.\nThe clinical vigilance and competent biologist's eye is necessary to prevent the resurgence of this disease. The epidemiological surveillance system should be maintained and kept as well as the food safety standards monitoring at the borders.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9273cf058f61000dd15","authors":["Gzara Zargouni, Ahlem","Tej Dellagi, Rafla","Ben Alaya, Nissaf","Ben Jemaa, Noureddine","Gamara, Dhikrayet","Ben Salah, Afif","Triki, H","Kallel, K","Chaker, E","Rachdi, M T"],"first_seen_on":"2016-01-28T11:57:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0041-4131"],"issue":"8","journal":"Tunisie m\u00e9dicale","last_mentioned_on":1453982253,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26815521?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26815521","pubdate":"2015-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Aboriginal malaria in Tunisia: about the 4 cases registered in 2013 in Tunis.","type":"article","volume":"93","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/indigenous-malaria-tunisia-4-cases-registered-2013-tunisia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7059888,"mean":6.2742286087554,"rank":6067819,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7059888,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319093,"mean":9.2534283090767,"rank":262686,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319093,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146,"mean":0.81068965517241,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MalariaPapers\/statuses\/692677890304036865","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5054988],"posted_on":"2016-01-28T11:57:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Malaria Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/633328476070785024\/zGKHLt0g_normal.png","description":"I'm a bot tweeting papers about malaria as they appear on PubMed (& now preprints on BioRxiv). \n\nRun by @theosanderson.","id_on_source":"MalariaPapers","tweeter_id":"3428446343","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":136},"tweet_id":"692677890304036865"}]}}
