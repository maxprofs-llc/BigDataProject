In Group-1, there were 23 patients with T2DM, and patients in Group-2 comprised of 22 self-reported non-diabetic controls. Under local anesthesia, platform-switched implants were placed in the mandible. Peri-implant bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depth (PD), marginal bone loss (MBL) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels were measured at 12 and 24\u00a0months of follow-up. Participants were also enrolled in a biannual oral hygiene maintenance program.\nThe mean age of participants in groups 1 and 2 were 42.4\u00a0years (40-46\u00a0years) and 41.8\u00a0years (39-44\u00a0years), respectively. In Group-1, the mean duration of T2DM was 14.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0months. At 12 and 24\u00a0months of follow-up, there was no significant difference in the mean HbA1c levels among patients in groups 1 and 2. At 12 and 24\u00a0months of follow-up, there was no significant difference in peri-implant BOP, PD and MBL in both groups.\nPlatform-switched implants can remain clinically and radiographically stable in patients with T2DM in a manner similar to non-diabetic individuals. However, it is emphasized that bone loss around implants is influenced by several factors (such as oral hygiene status, glycemic control and tobacco smoking) and not merely platform switching.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000256b","authors":["Al Amri, Mohammad D.","Abduljabbar, Tariq S.","Al Amri, Mohammad D","Abduljabbar, Tariq S"],"doi":"10.1111\/clr.12787","endpage":"n\/a","first_seen_on":"2016-01-29T09:00:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1600-0501"],"journal":"Clinical Oral Implants Research","last_mentioned_on":1454152109,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/clr.12787","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26822289?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/clr.12787\/pdf","pmid":"26822289","pubdate":"2016-01-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"n\/a","subjects":["dentistry","generalsurgery"],"title":"Comparison of clinical and radiographic status of platform-switched implants placed in patients with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus: a 24-month follow-up longitudinal study.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-clinical-radiographic-status-platformswitched-implants-placed-patients-without-type-2-dia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7062006,"mean":6.279377068691,"rank":5290996,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":990574,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7062006,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319840,"mean":9.2653803882575,"rank":220390,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":56375,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319840,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":630,"mean":1.8315166931638,"rank":394,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":630,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":0.64473684210526,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
