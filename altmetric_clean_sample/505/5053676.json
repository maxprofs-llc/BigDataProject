Several strategies have been developed against glutamate excitotoxicity, however none of them have not shown positive results in the clinical practice so far. Nowadays, the concept of blood\/brain glutamate grabbing or scavenging is well recognized as a novel and attractive protective strategy to reduce the excitotoxic effect of excess extracellular glutamate that accumulates in the brain following an ischemic stroke. The main advantage of this novel therapeutic strategy is that it occurs in the blood circulation and therefore does not affect the normal brain neurophysiology, as it has been described for other drug treatments used against glutamate excitotoxicity. In this work we report all experimental data from the beginning of our studies, focused on stroke pathology, and we describe new findings about the potential application of this therapy. Future clinical trials will allow to know the real efficacy of this novel therapeutic strategy in stroke patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002ce7","authors":["Jos\u00e9 Castillo","Mar\u00eda Isabel Loza","David Mirelman","Jos\u00e9 Brea","Miguel Blanco","Tom\u00e1s Sobrino","Francisco Campos"],"doi":"10.1177\/0271678x15606721","first_seen_on":"2016-01-28T09:01:41+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1559-7016"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1453994704,"links":["http:\/\/jcb.sagepub.com\/content\/36\/2\/292.full?platform=hootsuite"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jcb.sagepub.com\/content\/36\/2\/292.full.pdf","pmid":"26661174","pubdate":"2016-01-28T22:48:31+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"0271678X15606721","subjects":["metabolism","brain"],"title":"A novel mechanism of neuroprotection: Blood glutamate grabber","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-mechanism-neuroprotection-blood-glutamate-grabber"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7059888,"mean":6.2742286087554,"rank":3246223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3754060,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7059888,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319092,"mean":9.2534714109765,"rank":148601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":167129,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319092,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1222,"mean":5.0075872235872,"rank":706,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":510,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1222,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107,"mean":4.9295849056604,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
