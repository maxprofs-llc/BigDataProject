The biological control of this disease has become an attractive alternative to the chemical fungicides and other conventional control methods. In this review, the research trends and biological control efficiencies (BCE) of different microbial strains since 2000 are reviewed in detail, considering types of microbial genera, inoculum application methods, plant growth medium and conditions, inoculum application with amendments, and co-inoculation of different microbial strains and how those affect the BCE of Fusarium wilt. The data evaluation showed that the BCE of biocontrol agents was higher against the Fusarium wilt of cucumber compared to the Fusarium wilts of banana and tomato. Several biocontrol agents mainly Bacillus, Trichoderma, Pseudomonas, nonpathogenic Fusarium, and Penicillium strains were evaluated to control Fusarium wilt, but still this lethal disease could not be controlled completely. We have discussed different reasons of inconsistent results and recommendations for the betterment of BCE in the future. This review provides knowledge of the biotechnology of biological control of Fusarium wilt of cucumber, banana, and tomato in a nut shell that will provide researchers a beginning line to start and to organize and plan research for the future studies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4cd3cf058f61000050f","authors":["Raza, Waseem","Ling, Ning","Zhang, Ruifu","Huang, Qiwei","Xu, Yangchun","Shen, Qirong"],"doi":"10.3109\/07388551.2015.1130683","first_seen_on":"2016-01-27T17:24:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1549-7801"],"journal":"Critical Reviews in Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1453956445,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26810104?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26810104","pubdate":"2016-01-27T22:01:01+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Success evaluation of the biological control of Fusarium wilts of cucumber, banana, and tomato since 2000 and future research strategies.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/success-evaluation-biological-control-ifusariumi-wilts-cucumber-banana-tomato-since-2000-future-rese"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7059888,"mean":6.2742286087554,"rank":2904406,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4072015,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7059888,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":318719,"mean":9.2558023581972,"rank":125261,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":188553,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":318719,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241,"mean":4.7028583333333,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":12.6086,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
