The therapeutic options for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who progress after first-line chemotherapy have been limited from a long time. Docetaxel has remained a cornerstone of second-line treatment for more than 20 years, but it is associated with an unfavorable safety profile. Recently, the results from immunotherapy treatment with anti-PD1 and PD-L1 inhibitors has changed our current knowledge base and increased therapeutic options for patients with NSCLC in the second-line setting. The results of 2 randomized phase III trials assessing nivolumab in lung cancer, Check-Mate-017 and Check-Mate-057, have deeply changed our current clinical practice and raised several discussion points. This paper explores the recent findings about nivolumab for the treatment of NSCLC in the second-line setting by analyzing recent trial findings and discussing their implications in clinical practice and future directions. The paper also summarizes the conclusions from an International Experts Panel Meeting of the Italian Association of Thoracic Oncology.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005807","authors":["C.
