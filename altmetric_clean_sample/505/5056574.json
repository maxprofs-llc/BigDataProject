Subjects were required to brush their teeth twice daily for 2 minutes using a standard fluoride toothpaste. During the study, subjects were assessed for clinical attachment loss and probing pocket depths to the nearest mm at six sites per tooth by the same calibrated examiner. Gingival recession was calculated at pre-existing sites as the difference between clinical attachment loss and probing pocket depths. Hard and soft oral tissues were examined to assess safety.\nAfter 35\u00b12 months, mean gingival recession did not differ significantly between groups, but was significantly reduced from baseline (p<0.001) from 2.35\u00b10.35 mm to 1.90\u00b10.58 mm in the power and from 2.26\u00b10.31\u00a0mm to 1.81\u00b10.66 mm in the manual group.\nGingival recession in subjects with pre-existing recession was significantly reduced after three years of brushing with either a power or manual toothbrush.
