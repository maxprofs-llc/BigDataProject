However, the mechanisms by which projection neurons acquire their final properties during postnatal stages are still poorly understood. In this study, we show that the number of neurons co-expressing Ctip2 and Satb2, respectively involved in the early specification of subcerebral and callosal projection neurons, progressively increases after birth in the somatosensory cortex. Ctip2\/Satb2 postnatal co-localization defines two distinct neuronal subclasses projecting either to the contralateral cortex or to the brainstem suggesting that Ctip2\/Satb2 co-expression may refine their properties rather than determine their identity. Gain- and loss-of-function approaches reveal that the transcriptional adaptor Lmo4 drives this maturation program through modulation of epigenetic mechanisms in a time- and area-specific manner, thereby indicating that a previously unknown genetic program postnatally promotes the acquisition of final subtype-specific features.","altmetric_jid":"560420b12a83eea5738b4567","authors":["Harb, Kawssar","Magrinelli, Elia","Nicolas, C\u00e9line S","Lukianets, Nikita","Frangeul, Laura","Pietri, Mariel","Sun, Tao","Sandoz, Guillaume","Grammont, Franck","Jabaudon, Denis","Studer, Michele","Alfano, Christian"],"doi":"10.7554\/elife.09531","first_seen_on":"2016-01-28T14:03:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2050-084X"],"journal":"eLife","last_mentioned_on":1453995369,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26814051?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26814051","pubdate":"2016-01-28T22:00:49+00:00","title":"Area-specific development of distinct projection neuron subclasses is regulated by postnatal epigenetic modifications.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/areaspecific-development-distinct-projection-neuron-subclasses-regulated-postnatal-epigenetic-modifi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7059888,"mean":6.2742286087554,"rank":3087009,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3812189,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7059888,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319092,"mean":9.2534710975863,"rank":137969,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":170491,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319092,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3241,"mean":27.967627160494,"rank":2566,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":609,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3241,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":364,"mean":26.932710743802,"rank":276,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":80,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":364,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
