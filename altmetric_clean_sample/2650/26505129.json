The objective was to determine effects of adding boar SP to the freezing extender on sperm quality, tyrosine phosphorylation and fertilizing ability of frozen-thawed ram sperm. Semen was collected from eight Small-tail Han rams and extended in a glucose-egg yolk buffer supplemented with 0, 20, 40, or 60% porcine SP (from Large white boars). Compared to all other groups, 40% boar SP increased sperm viability and motility (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), whereas 20% boar SP had no beneficial effect, and 60% SP reduced sperm quality and motility (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Compared to control (0%), 40% boar SP inhibited cryo-capacitation and tyrosine phosphorylation of frozen-thawed ram sperm, and improved the proportion of capacitated sperm and tyrosine phosphorylation after in\u00a0vitro capacitation (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Furthermore, based on viscous medium penetration tests, 40% boar SP increased sperm penetration (944.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0121.5 vs 555.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a088.7; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Finally, 40% boar SP improved pregnancy rate for intracervical AI (47.5 vs 33.3%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), apparently due to inhibition of cryo-capacitation, although pregnancy rate for intravaginal AI was not affected (31.6 vs 30.0%).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f61000376c","authors":["Yi Fang","Rongzhen Zhong","Xiaosheng Zhang","Jinlong Zhang","Daowei Zhou"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.theriogenology.2017.09.011","first_seen_on":"2017-09-24T10:11:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0093691X","1879-3231"],"journal":"Theriogenology","last_mentioned_on":1506253774,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?cmd=Search&term=(((veterinary)+AND+%222017%2F09%2F23+06.12%22%5BMHDA%5D%3A%222017%2F09%2F24+06.10%22%5BMHDA%5D))+NOT+((+(((%22veterinary%22%5BTIAB%5D+OR+%22veterinary%22%5BTIAB%5D)))+AND+%220001%22%5BEDAT%5D%3A%222017%2F09%2F23+06.12%22%5BEDAT%5D))&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?cmd=Search&term=(((veterinary)+AND+%222017%2F09%2F24+05.56%22%5BMHDA%5D%3A%222017%2F09%2F24+07.49%22%5BMHDA%5D))+NOT+((+(((%22veterinary%22%5BTIAB%5D+OR+%22veterinary%22%5BTIAB%5D)))+AND+%220001%22%5BEDAT%5D%3A%222017%2F09%2F24+05.56%22%5BEDAT%5D))&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28941408","pubdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Boar seminal plasma inhibits cryo-capacitation of frozen-thawed ram sperm and improves fertility following intracervical insemination","type":"article","volume":"105"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457084,"mean":7.1060307514935,"rank":7307572,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457084,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115646,"mean":11.655409676164,"rank":94200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115646,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1065,"mean":2.1349530075188,"rank":698,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1065,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":0.55681818181818,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ReportVet\/statuses\/911895755505360896","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26505129],"posted_on":"2017-09-24T10:11:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Veterinary Report","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/688788078593454082\/1a9Go1Wt_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"ReportVet","tweeter_id":"4821798580","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":10},"tweet_id":"911895755505360896"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ReportVet\/statuses\/911920540230631426","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26505129],"posted_on":"2017-09-24T11:49:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Veterinary Report","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/688788078593454082\/1a9Go1Wt_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"ReportVet","tweeter_id":"4821798580","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":10},"tweet_id":"911920540230631426"}]}}
