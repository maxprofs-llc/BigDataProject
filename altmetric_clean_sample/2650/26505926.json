Lerner takes us through some of those programs, both past efforts that were successful and widely accepted and current endeavors that look promising but face all sorts of obstacles. Keep the faith, he admonishes. The \"winds change and public health efforts currently out of favor can once again gain support.\" Lerner's meditation-cum-exhortation is one of six essays in this issue about how to set and pursue public health goals in light of the gap between ideals and reality.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029b3","doi":"10.1002\/hast.760","first_seen_on":"2017-09-24T10:37:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["00930334","1552-146X"],"issue":"5","journal":"Hastings Center Report","last_mentioned_on":1506249439,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28940339?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28940339","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Ethics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Philosophy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Nursing","Social Sciences"],"subjects":["healthservicesresearch","ethics","psychiatry"],"title":"Rough Justice","type":"article","volume":"47","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rough-justice-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457084,"mean":7.1060307514935,"rank":7307571,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457084,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115645,"mean":11.655498789388,"rank":94198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115645,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":678,"mean":7.8301270310192,"rank":649,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":678,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":5.1095,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Psychology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/gag4all\/statuses\/911902359906897920","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26505926],"posted_on":"2017-09-24T10:37:19+00:00","author":{"name":"Andrea Gaggioli","url":"http:\/\/www.positivetechnology.it","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/851782358642688001\/RZltRHSH_normal.jpg","description":"Researcher.
