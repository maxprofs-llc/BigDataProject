Evolution of FHR indices throughout gestation was analysed through Spearman correlation coefficient. Comparison between male and female fetuses was performed using nonparametric bootstrap 95% confidence intervals for the median.\nMean FHR decreased significantly throughout gestation, whereas most variability indices increased. Sympatho-vagal balance measured by spectral analysis exhibited two local maxima at 29-30 and 34-35weeks and decreased afterwards. Entropy indices increased until around the 34th week, slightly decreasing after the 37th week. Female fetuses presented higher mean FHR and entropy from the 34th week afterwards, and lower short-term variability and sympatho-vagal balance in the same period.\nSpectral and entropy analysis should be considered as a complement to conventional FHR variability analysis, aiming at a better characterization and follow-up of fetal development\/maturation throughout gestation. Additionally, gestational age needs to be considered when defining reference ranges for FHR indices in systems of computerized analysis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002742","authors":["Hern\u00e2ni Gon\u00e7alves","C\u00e9lia Amorim-Costa","Diogo Ayres-de-Campos","Jo\u00e3o Bernardes"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.earlhumdev.2017.09.002","first_seen_on":"2017-09-24T08:25:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["03783782"],"journal":"Early Human Development","last_mentioned_on":1506241497,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0378378217301718?_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_origin=gateway&_docanchor=&md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb"],"pmid":"28889037","pubdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["embryology","perinatology","pediatrics"],"title":"Gender-specific evolution of fetal heart rate variability throughout gestation: A study of 8823 cases","type":"article","volume":"115","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genderspecific-evolution-fetal-heart-rate-variability-throughout-gestation-study-8823-cases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457084,"mean":7.1060307514935,"rank":7307549,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457084,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115636,"mean":11.656284446751,"rank":94178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115636,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":783,"mean":4.3306905370844,"rank":626,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":783,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":11.928333333333,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/uranus_2\/statuses\/911869048769540097","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26502703],"posted_on":"2017-09-24T08:24:57+00:00","author":{"name":"\u30de\u30fc\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30fc\uff12\u4e16","url":"http:\/\/smetc.blog120.fc2.com\/?sp","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/650483455248064512\/EOJq3sZX_normal.png","description":"\u5c11\u306a\u304f\u3068\u3082\u5927\u5b66\u521d\u5e74\u6b21\u307e\u3067\u306f\u5834\u9762\u7dd8\u9ed9\u75c7\uff08\u81ea\u5df1\u8a3a\u65ad\uff09\u3060\u3063\u305f\u7537\u3002Twitter\u307e\u3068\u3081(http:\/\/psychobrain.seesaa.net\/)\u3002 \u6ce8\u610f\u4e8b\u9805\u2460\u8ad6\u6587\u306f\u8981\u7d04\u3057\u304b\u8aad\u3093\u3067\u3044\u306a\u3044\u5834\u5408\u304c\u591a\u3044\u2461\u9593\u9055\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3042\u308a\u2462\u79c1\u306f\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3002","id_on_source":"uranus_2","tweeter_id":"253847599","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":3452},"tweet_id":"911869048769540097"}]}}
