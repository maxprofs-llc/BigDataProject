However, the effects and mechanisms of CuE on osteosarcoma (OS) have not been well understood. This study aimed to test whether CuE could inhibit growth and invasion of OS cells and reveal its underlying molecular mechanism. After various concentrations of CuE treatment, the anti-proliferative effect of CuE was assessed using the cell counting Kit-8 assay. Flow cytometry analysis was employed to measure apoptosis of OS cells. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by propidium iodide staining. Transwell assay was performed to evaluate the effect of CuE on invasion potential of OS cells. The protein levels were measured by Western Blot. In addition, the potency of CuE on OS cells growth inhibition was assessed in vivo. Our results showed that CuE inhibited cell growth and invasion, induced a cell cycle arrest and triggered apoptosis and modulated the expression of cell growth, cell cycle and cell apoptosis regulators. Moreover, CuE inhibited the PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which suppressed the invasion and metastasis of OS. In addition, we also found that CuE inhibited OS cell growth in vivo. Taken together, our study demonstrated that CuE could inhibit OS tumor growth and invasion through inhibiting the PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR signaling pathway. Our findings suggest that CuE can be considered to be a promising anticancer agent for OS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f6","authors":["Ying Wang","Shumei Xu","Yaochi Wu","Junfeng Zhang","Yijun Sun"],"doi":"10.1042\/bsr20160165","endpage":"e00405","first_seen_on":"2016-11-10T00:18:03+00:00","issns":["1573-4935","0144-8463"],"issue":"6","journal":"Bioscience Reports","last_mentioned_on":1481272513,"links":["http:\/\/www.bioscirep.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/36\/6\/e00405?rss=1","http:\/\/www.bioscirep.org\/content\/36\/6\/e00405","http:\/\/www.bioscirep.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/BSR20160165v1?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.bioscirep.org\/content\/ppbioscirep\/36\/6\/e00405.full.pdf","pmid":"27653525","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Portland Press Limited","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e00405","subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"Cucurbitacin E inhibits osteosarcoma cells proliferation and invasion through attenuation of PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR signalling pathway","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cucurbitacin-e-inhibits-osteosarcoma-cells-proliferation-invasion-through-attenuation-pi3kaktmtor-si"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7866440,"mean":6.6628832942016,"rank":5685707,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1900611,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7866440,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234390,"mean":13.014511184398,"rank":151166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":72257,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234390,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":518,"mean":1.7153075435203,"rank":261,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":518,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":1.3104905660377,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PPPublishing\/statuses\/796507117410811904","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13477145],"posted_on":"2016-11-10T00:17:49+00:00","author":{"name":"Portland Press","url":"http:\/\/www.portlandpresspublishing.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/779221468722892800\/OCt6heX0_normal.jpg","description":"Publisher wholly owned by @BiochemSoc, embedded in the global scientific community, dedicated to promoting & sharing research for the advancement of science.","id_on_source":"PPPublishing","tweeter_id":"567228748","geo":{"lt":51.50853,"ln":-0.12574,"country":"GB"},"followers":2753},"tweet_id":"796507117410811904"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/for_Content\/statuses\/796511604250710016","license":"gnip","rt":["PPPublishing"],"citation_ids":[13477145],"posted_on":"2016-11-10T00:35:39+00:00","author":{"name":"for Content","url":"http:\/\/t.co\/4N0sF5tCKF","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2343596314\/gkqqtg4fsskxyk7r71vi_normal.jpeg","description":"Freelance copywriting, journalism and social media.
