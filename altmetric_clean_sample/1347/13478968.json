The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) serves as a pattern recognition receptor for endogenous inflammatory ligands. Soluble RAGE (sRAGE) is a truncated form of RAGE that functions as a decoy and acts as an anti-inflammatory molecule. The aim of this study was to determine whether sRAGE has therapeutic effects and the mechanisms active in sRAGE-overexpressing MSCs (sRAGE-MSCs) in an experimental model of RA. sRAGE-MSCs were generated by DNA transfection of human adipose tissue-derived MSCs (Ad-hMSCs). MSCs showed increased expression of VEGF, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and HMGB-1 under inflammatory conditions. However, sRAGE-MSCs showed significantly lower production of these proinflammatory molecules. Expression of immunomodulatory molecules such as IL-10, TGF-\u03b2, and indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase was higher in sRAGE-MSCs than in mock-MSCs. sRAGE-MSCs showed enhanced migration potential. Transplantation of sRAGE-MSCs into arthritic IL-1Ra-knockout mice markedly suppressed inflammatory arthritis, decreased Th17 cells, and reciprocally increased regulatory T cells. The differentiation of IFN-\u03b3(+)CD4(+) and IL-17(+)CD4(+) cells was inhibited by incubation with sRAGE-MSCs compared with mock-MSCs. These findings suggest that sRAGE overexpression in Ad-hMSCs optimizes their immunoregulatory properties, which may be useful as a novel cellular therapy for RA.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Min-Jung Park","Seung Hoon Lee","Su-Jin Moon","Jung-Ah Lee","Eun-Jung Lee","Eun-Kyung Kim","Jin-Sil Park","Jennifer Lee","Jun-Ki Min","Seok Jung Kim","Sung-Hwan Park","Mi-La Cho","Park, Min-Jung","Lee, Seung Hoon","Moon, Su-Jin","Lee, Jung-Ah","Lee, Eun-Jung","Kim, Eun-Kyung","Park, Jin-Sil","Lee, Jennifer","Min, Jun-Ki","Kim, Seok Jung","Park, Sung-Hwan","Cho, Mi-La"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep35933","first_seen_on":"2016-11-10T03:15:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1479181758,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep35933","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27804999"],"pmid":"27804999","pubdate":"2016-11-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Autoimmunity","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"35933","subjects":["science"],"title":"Overexpression of soluble RAGE in mesenchymal stem cells enhances their immunoregulatory potential for cellular therapy in autoimmune arthritis","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/overexpression-soluble-rage-mesenchymal-stem-cells-enhances-immunoregulatory-potential-cellular-ther"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":2.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7695823,"mean":6.6062009433119,"rank":3121282,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4525648,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7695823,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232457,"mean":12.976375262415,"rank":93418,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":137047,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232457,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30254,"mean":14.925813638317,"rank":12515,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":17323,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30254,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2969,"mean":17.290613207547,"rank":1369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":1568,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2969,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Chemistry":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":3,"Unspecified":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IE":1,"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/celltherapynews\/statuses\/796551813461921792","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13478968],"posted_on":"2016-11-10T03:15:26+00:00","author":{"name":"Cell Therapy News","url":"http:\/\/www.celltherapynews.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/748289281672642560\/ULgWUrkm_normal.jpg","description":"The online resource for cell and gene therapy research.
