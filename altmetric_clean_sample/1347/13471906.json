Units of the considered networks are bi-stable, having two co-existing attractors of different types (chaotic and periodic). The occurrence of chimeras is discussed, and the influence of coupling radius and coupling strength on their co-existence is analyzed (including typical bifurcation scenarios). We present a statistical analysis and investigate sensitivity of the probability of observing chimeras to the initial conditions and parameter values. Due to the fact that each unit of the considered networks is individually excited, we study the influence of the excitation failure on stability of observed states. Typical transitions are shown, and changes in network's dynamics are discussed. We analyze systems of coupled van der Pol-Duffing oscillators and the Duffing ones. Described chimera states are robust as they are observed in the wide regions of parameter values, as well as in other networks of coupled forced oscillators.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024db","authors":["Dawid Dudkowski","Dawid Dudkowski","Yuri Maistrenko","Tomasz Kapitaniak"],"doi":"10.1063\/1.4967386","first_seen_on":"2016-11-09T16:27:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1089-7682"],"issue":"11","journal":"Chaos","last_mentioned_on":1478704618,"links":["http:\/\/scitation.aip.org\/content\/aip\/journal\/chaos\/26\/11\/10.1063\/1.4967386?TRACK=RSS"],"pmid":"27908005","pubdate":"2016-11-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"AIP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Mathematics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Numerical And Computational Mathematics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Mathematics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Occurrence and stability of chimera states in coupled externally excited oscillators","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/occurrence-stability-chimera-states-coupled-externally-excited-oscillators"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7667486,"mean":6.5863981409766,"rank":6634758,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7667486,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232190,"mean":12.974547898479,"rank":187984,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232190,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":875,"mean":4.8283661327231,"rank":431,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":875,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":3.1472424242424,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
