Monitoring of decomposed components of SF\u2086, insulating medium of gas-insulated switchgear, is a feasible method of early-warning to avoid the occurrence of sudden fault. Polyaniline thin-film with protonic acid deposited possesses wide application prospects in the gas-sensing field. Polyaniline thin-film sensors with only sulfosalicylic acid deposited and with both hydrochloric acid and sulfosalicylic acid deposited were prepared by chemical oxidative polymerization method. Gas-sensing experiment was carried out to test properties of new sensors when exposed to H\u2082S and SO\u2082, two decomposed products of SF\u2086 under discharge. The gas-sensing properties of these two sensors were compared with that of a hydrochloric acid deposited sensor. Results show that the hydrochloric acid and sulfosalicylic acid deposited polyaniline thin-film sensor shows the most outstanding sensitivity and selectivity to H\u2082S and SO\u2082 when concentration of gases range from 10 to 100 \u03bcL\/L, with sensitivity changing linearly with concentration of gases. The sensor also possesses excellent long-time and thermal stability. This research lays the foundation for preparing practical gas-sensing devices to detect H\u2082S and SO\u2082 in gas-insulated switchgears at room temperature.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5333cf058f6100045ba","authors":["Xingchen Dong"],"doi":"10.3390\/s16111889","first_seen_on":"2016-11-10T04:22:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1424-8220"],"issue":"11","journal":"Sensors (14248220)","last_mentioned_on":1478751732,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/16\/11\/1889?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/16\/11\/1889\/pdf","pmid":"27834895","pubdate":"2016-11-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Investigation of Gas-Sensing Property of Acid-Deposited Polyaniline Thin-Film Sensors for Detecting H2S and SO2","type":"article","volume":"16"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7672691,"mean":6.5915218985731,"rank":5803626,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1033599,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7672691,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232033,"mean":12.975839849676,"rank":159898,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":44134,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232033,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3090,"mean":1.7609789575915,"rank":1556,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1045,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3090,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":466,"mean":1.3844086021505,"rank":158,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":151,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":466,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"MX":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RamonElizaldeN\/statuses\/796568616959213568","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13479363],"posted_on":"2016-11-10T04:22:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Ramon Humberto","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/879108639642058752\/Z-OQgpTN_normal.jpg","description":"Hay una fuerza motriz m\u00e1s poderosa que el vapor, la electricidad y la energ\u00eda at\u00f3mica: la voluntad.\n@AlbertEinstein","id_on_source":"RamonElizaldeN","tweeter_id":"792248012651102208","geo":{"lt":29.0971,"ln":-110.95749,"country":"MX"},"followers":290},"tweet_id":"796568616959213568"}]}}
