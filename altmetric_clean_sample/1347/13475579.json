An ATP-dependent tweezer-like motion of the nucleotide-binding domains in ABCE1 transfers mechanical energy to the ribosome and tears the ribosome subunits apart. The post-recycling complex (PRC) then re-initiates mRNA translation. Here, we probed the so far unknown architecture of the 1-MDa PRC (40S\/30S\u00b7ABCE1) by chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry (XL-MS). Our study reveals ABCE1 bound to the translational factor-binding (GTPase) site with multiple cross-link contacts of the helix-loop-helix motif to the S24e ribosomal protein. Cross-linking of the FeS cluster domain to the ribosomal protein S12 substantiates an extreme lever-arm movement of the FeS cluster domain during ribosome recycling. We were thus able to reconstitute and structurally analyse a key complex in the translational cycle, resembling the link between translation initiation and ribosome recycling.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Kristin Kiosze-Becker","Alessandro Ori","Milan Gerovac","Andr\u00e9 Heuer","Elina N\u00fcrenberg-Goloub","Umar Jan Rashid","Thomas Becker","Roland Beckmann","Martin Beck","Robert Tamp\u00e9"],"doi":"10.1038\/ncomms13248","first_seen_on":"2016-11-09T21:22:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","last_mentioned_on":1495296011,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/ncomms13248?WT.feed_name=subjects_mass-spectrometry&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/NCOMMS13248","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/ncomms13248?cid=social_20161123_68048916","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/ncomms13248?cid=social_cp1193_20170520_68048746&adbid=1533528970014516&adbpl=fb&adbpr=116718211695606"],"pmid":"27824037","pubdate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"13248","subjects":["science","biology"],"title":"Structure of the ribosome post-recycling complex probed by chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structure-ribosome-postrecycling-complex-probed-chemical-crosslinking-mass-spectrometry"},"altmetric_score":{"score":25.5,"score_history":{"1y":25.5,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":25.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8243836,"mean":6.9683207276644,"rank":341306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":7902469,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8243836,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240932,"mean":13.154520480967,"rank":19495,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":221409,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240932,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12842,"mean":44.342921890819,"rank":4453,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":8377,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12842,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":894,"mean":61.242389697648,"rank":404,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":489,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":894,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
