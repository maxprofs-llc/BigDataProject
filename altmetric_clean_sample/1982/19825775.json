Current deworming programmes might remove this helminth-associated protective effect. Therefore, we evaluated the anthelmintic treatment effect on changes in IR.\nWe conducted a double-blind household-cluster-randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial on Flores island, Indonesia, an area endemic for soil-transmitted helminths (STH). All subjects received four rounds of three-monthly albendazole or matching placebo for three consecutive days. The primary outcome was the change in homeostatic model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) in those >16 years old. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed involving all subjects and ad hoc in the helminth-infected subjects.\nWe examined 797 (in 329 households) and 872 (in 353 households) subjects, who were assigned randomly into the albendazole and placebo arm, respectively. Albendazole was associated with a significant reduction in STH prevalence, total IgE and eosinophil count. Whereas albendazole had no effect on IR [Estimated treatment effect (95% CI), 0.006 (-0.010 - 0.022)], p=0.48] at the community level, it was associated with a significant increase in IR [0.031 (0.004 - 0.059), p=0.04, p-value for interaction=0.01] among helminth-infected subjects as detected by microscopy. Pathway analysis suggested that this might in part be due to an increased body mass index or a reduced eosinophil count.\nAnthelmintic treatment reduces STH prevalence, total IgE and eosinophil count but has no effect on IR at the community level. In helminth-infected subjects, treatment significantly increases IR, highlighting the need for metabolic health monitoring with ongoing deworming programmes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000255e","authors":["Tahapary, Dicky L.","de Ruiter, Karin","Martin, Ivonne","Brienen, Eric A.T.","van Lieshout, Lisette","Cobbaert, Christa M","Soewondo, Pradana","Djuardi, Yenny","Wiria, Aprilianto E","Houwing-Duistermaat, Jeanine J","Sartono, Erliyani","Smit, Johannes WA","Yazdanbakhsh, Maria","Supali, Taniawati","Dicky L.
