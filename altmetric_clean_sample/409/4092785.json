Ethylene is involved in the induction of aerenchyma formation. reduced culm number 1 (rcn1) is a rice mutant in which the gene encoding the ATP-binding cassette transporter RCN1\/OsABCG5 is defective. Here, we report that the induction of aerenchyma formation was reduced in roots of rcn1 grown in stagnant deoxygenated nutrient solution (i.e., under stagnant conditions, which mimic oxygen-deficient conditions in waterlogged soils). 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase (ACS) is a key enzyme in ethylene biosynthesis. Stagnant conditions hardly induced the expression of ACS1 in rcn1 roots, resulting in low ethylene production in the roots. Accumulation of saturated very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) of 24, 26 and 28 carbons was reduced in rcn1 roots. Exogenously supplied VLCFA (26 carbons) increased the expression level of ACS1, and induced aerenchyma formation in rcn1 roots. Moreover, in rice lines in which the gene encoding a fatty acid elongase (CUT1L) was silenced, both ACS1 expression and aerenchyma formation were reduced. Interestingly, the expression of ACS1, CUT1L and RCN1\/OsABCG5 was induced predominantly in the outer part of roots (OPR) under stagnant conditions. These results suggest that, in rice under oxygen-deficient conditions, VLCFAs increase ethylene production by promoting ACC biosynthesis in the OPR, which, in turn, induces aerenchyma formation in the root cortex.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000333b","authors":["Yamauchi, Takaki","Shiono, Katsuhiro","Nagano, Minoru","Fukazawa, Aya","Ando, Miho","Takamure, Itsuro","Mori, Hitoshi","Nishizawa, Naoko K","Kawai-Yamada, Maki","Tsutsumi, Nobuhiro","Kato, Kiyoaki","Nakazono, Mikio"],"doi":"10.1104\/pp.15.00106","first_seen_on":"2015-06-04T10:28:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-2548"],"journal":"Plant Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1468077508,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26036614?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26036614","pubdate":"2015-06-04T22:04:16+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Ethylene Biosynthesis is Promoted by Very-Long-Chain Fatty Acids during Lysigenous Aerenchyma Formation in Rice Roots.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ethylene-biosynthesis-promoted-verylongchain-fatty-acids-during-lysigenous-aerenchyma-formation-rice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8037685,"mean":6.8229478924494,"rank":5815345,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1936940,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8037685,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":220680,"mean":8.4838589444398,"rank":141965,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":65546,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":220680,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3809,"mean":4.0053702731092,"rank":3037,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":617,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3809,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84,"mean":3.1690120481928,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
