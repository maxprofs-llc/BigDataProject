The aim of this study was to examine whether short- and\/or long-term glycemic variability (GV) contribute to CAN.\nA total of 110 patients with type 2 diabetes who underwent three-day continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) completed five standardized autonomic neuropathy tests. Short-term GV was measured by the standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV) of glucose, and the mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) in CGM. HbA1c variability was calculated from the intrapersonal SD, adjusted SD, and CV of serial HbA1c over 2-year period. CAN was defined as the presence of at least two abnormal parasympathetic function tests. The severity of CAN was evaluated by total scores of five autonomic function tests.\nIn univariate analysis, not only SD and CV in CGM but also all parameters of HbA1c variability were significantly higher in the patients with CAN (n\u2009=\u200947, 42.7\u00a0%) than in those without CAN. In multivariate analysis, CV (Odds ratio [OR] 1.07, 95\u00a0% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.13; p\u2009=\u20090.033), but neither SD nor MAGE in CGM, independently correlated with the presence of CAN. All parameters of HbA1c variability, such as SD of HbA1c (OR 12.10 [95\u00a0% CI 2.29-63.94], p\u2009=\u20090.003), adjusted SD of HbA1c (OR 17.02 [95\u00a0% CI 2.66-108.86], p\u2009=\u20090.003), and log CV of HbA1c (OR 24.00 [95\u00a0% CI 3.09-186.48], p\u2009=\u20090.002), were significantly associated with the presence of CAN. The patients with higher HbA1c variability had an increased risk of advanced CAN.\nCV in CGM and all parameters of HbA1c variability were independently associated with the presence of CAN in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes requiring CGM.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007ee","authors":["Ji E Jun","Sang-Man Jin","Jongha Baek","Sewon Oh","Kyu Y Hur","Myung-Shik Lee","Moon-Kyu Lee","Jae H Kim"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12933-015-0233-0","first_seen_on":"2015-06-04T18:31:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1475-2840"],"issue":"1","journal":"Cardiovascular Diabetology","last_mentioned_on":1433460779,"links":["http:\/\/www.cardiab.com\/content\/14\/1\/70\/abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/s12933-015-0233-0"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cardiab.com\/content\/pdf\/s12933-015-0233-0.pdf","pmid":"26041130","pubdate":"2015-06-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["endocrinology","cardiology"],"title":"The association between glycemic variability and diabetic cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-between-glycemic-variability-diabetic-cardiovascular-autonomic-neuropathy-patients-type-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5187004,"mean":6.1241370799307,"rank":491110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":4691122,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5187004,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175002,"mean":8.7892912840499,"rank":25290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":149376,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175002,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":449,"mean":2.8357053571429,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":434,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":449,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":1.6205882352941,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
