Various resource-intensive interventions have attempted to assist women in managing their weight gain during pregnancy with limited success. A mobile phone app has been proposed as a convenient and cost-effective alternative to face-to-face interventions.\nThis paper describes the process of developing and pilot testing the Eating4Two app, which aims to provide women with a simple gestational weight gain (GWG) calculator, general dietary information, and the motivation to achieve a healthy weight gain during pregnancy.\nThe project involved the development of app components, including a graphing function that allows the user to record their weight throughout the pregnancy and to receive real-time feedback on weight gain progress and general information on antenatal nutrition. Stakeholder consultation was used to inform development. The app was pilot tested with 10 pregnant women using a mixed method approach via an online survey, 2 focus groups, and 1 individual interview.\nThe Eating4Two app took 7 months to develop and evaluate. It involved several disciplines--including nutrition and dietetics, midwifery, public health, and information technology--at the University of Canberra. Participants found the Eating4Two app to be a motivational tool but would have liked scales or other markers on the graph that demonstrated exact weight gain. They also liked the nutrition information; however, many felt it should be formatted in a more user friendly way.\nThe Eating4Two app was viewed by participants in our study as an innovative support system to help motivate healthy behaviors during pregnancy and as a credible resource for accessing nutrition-focused information. The feedback provided by participants will assist with refining the current prototype for use in a clinical intervention trial.","altmetric_jid":"55a7b9382a83ee14118b4567","authors":["Catherine Knight-Agarwal","Knight-Agarwal, Catherine","Davis, Deborah Lee","Williams, Lauren","Davey, Rachel","Cox, Robert","Clarke, Adam","Deborah Lee Davis","Lauren Williams","Rachel Davey","Robert Cox","Adam Clarke"],"doi":"10.2196\/mhealth.4071","first_seen_on":"2015-06-05T13:07:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2291-5222"],"issue":"2","journal":"JMIR mHealth and uHealth","last_mentioned_on":1441977081,"links":["http:\/\/mhealth.jmir.org\/2015\/2\/e44\/","http:\/\/mhealth.jmir.org\/2015\/2\/e44\/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26048313"],"pmid":"26048313","pubdate":"2015-06-05T20:15:00+00:00","publisher":"JMIR Publications Inc., Toronto, Canada","startpage":"e44","title":"Development and Pilot Testing of the Eating4two Mobile Phone App to Monitor Gestational Weight Gain.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/mhealth.jmir.org\/2015\/2\/e44\/","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-pilot-testing-eating4two-mobile-phone-app-monitor-gestational-weight-gain"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6326302,"mean":5.8274056156985,"rank":2498120,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":3765368,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6326302,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":183165,"mean":8.8095782468172,"rank":81385,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":98341,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":183165,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":202,"mean":15.748676616915,"rank":178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":202,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":11.25,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":3,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
