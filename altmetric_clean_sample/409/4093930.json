One hundred samples were collected over a 2-year period (2011 to 2012) from Chinese retail markets in Sardinia, Italy. To assess the conformity of the items with the trade name, a preliminary visual inspection of the samples by a simple morphological analysis was performed. According to the Council Regulations (EC) 104\/2000, 1224\/2009, and 2074\/2005, the Italian labels were examined to verify the appropriate indication of relevant information on traceability (trade name, scientific name, geographical area, and production method), and the samples of L. litulon were subjected to visual inspection to detect \"visible parasites.\" Altogether, a high percentage of mismatching (70%) between the scientific name and trade name was pointed out. Moreover, 60% of the samples were visibly infected by Spraguea lophii, a microsporidian parasite of the nervous tissue that forms typical lesions (xenomas) in the fish flesh near the vertebral column. Although S. lophii is not pathogenic to humans, the presence of xenomas can decompose the fish flesh and render it unfit for human consumption. The high percentage of mislabeling, together with the inaccuracy in the visual inspection by Chinese food business operators highlighted the need to improve the European Union control system of fishery products imported from China and marketed in Europe.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002db1","authors":["Meloni, Domenico","Arca, Costantino","Piras, Pierluigi"],"doi":"10.4315\/0362-028x.jfp-14-521","first_seen_on":"2015-06-04T14:55:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1944-9097"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Food Protection","last_mentioned_on":1433429704,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26038919?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26038919","pubdate":"2015-06-04T22:01:16+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Inaccuracy of Labeling and Visual Inspection for Microsporidian Parasites in Anglerfish Lophius litulon (Jordan, 1902) Collected from Chinese Retail Markets in Sardinia, Italy.","type":"article","volume":"78","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inaccuracy-labeling-visual-inspection-microsporidian-parasites-anglerfish-lophius-litulon-jordan-190"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5186943,"mean":6.1241265682193,"rank":4317324,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5186943,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175001,"mean":8.7893866514287,"rank":143152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175001,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":716,"mean":3.1940643356643,"rank":577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":716,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":3.4888888888889,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Other":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"AT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/par_papers\/status\/606474254234697728","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4093930],"posted_on":"2015-06-04T14:55:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Parasitology papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/528615611803238400\/tFsCRNLw_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot of #Parasitology papers in PubMed, bioRxiv, and PeerJ PrePrints.
