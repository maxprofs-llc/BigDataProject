Aggregation of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) by A\u03b2 oligomers induced synapse damage in cultured neurons. PrPC is attached to membranes via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, the composition of which affects protein targeting and cell signaling. Monoacylated PrPC incorporated into neurons bound \"natural A\u03b2\", sequestering A\u03b2 outside lipid rafts and preventing its accumulation at synapses. The presence of monoacylated PrPC reduced the A\u03b2-induced activation of cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and A\u03b2-induced synapse damage. This protective effect was stimulus specific, as treated neurons remained sensitive to \u03b1-synuclein, a protein associated with synapse damage in Parkinson's disease. In synaptosomes, the aggregation of PrPC by A\u03b2 oligomers triggered the formation of a signaling complex containing the cPLA2.a process, disrupted by monoacylated PrPC. We propose that monoacylated PrPC acts as a molecular sponge, binding A\u03b2 oligomers at the neuronal perikarya without activating cPLA2 or triggering synapse damage.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef652a83ee09648b4f4c","authors":["West, Ewan","Osborne, Craig","Nolan, William","Bate, Clive"],"doi":"10.3390\/biology4020367","first_seen_on":"2015-06-05T10:26:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2079-7737"],"issue":"2","journal":"Biology","last_mentioned_on":1434067200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26043272?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26043272"],"pmid":"26043272","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Monoacylated Cellular Prion Proteins Reduce Amyloid-\u03b2-Induced Activation of Cytoplasmic Phospholipase A2 and Synapse Damage.","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/monoacylated-cellular-prion-proteins-reduce-amyloid%CE%B2induced-activation-cytoplasmic-phospholipase-a2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5218786,"mean":6.1556744974188,"rank":509711,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":4687453,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5218786,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175604,"mean":8.8014223333316,"rank":26109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":148880,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175604,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100,"mean":2.2694747474747,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":95,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.75,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
