It has also been shown that selective opioid receptor agonists exert potent inhibitory action on pruritus and pain. In this study we examined whether two analogs of Salvinorin A, PR-37 and PR-38 exhibit antipruritic properties in mice.\nTo examine the antiscratch effect of PR-37 and PR-38 we used a mouse model of compound 48\/80-induced pruritus. In order to elucidate the mechanism of action of tested compounds, specific antagonists of opioid and cannabinoid receptors were used. The effect of PR-37 on the central nervous system was assessed by measuring motoric parameters and exploratory behaviors in mice.\nPR-37 and PR-38 (subcutaneous, s.c.) significantly reduced the number of compound 48\/80-induced scratching behaviors in mice in dose- and time-dependent manners. PR-38 was also active when orally administered. The antiscratch activity of PR-37 was blocked by the selective kappa opioid receptor antagonist, nor-binaltorphimine and that of PR-38 by the selective mu opioid receptor antagonist, \u03b2-funaltrexamine.\nIn conclusion, a novel framework for the development of new antipruritic drugs derived from salvinorin A has been validated.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002450","authors":["Salaga, M","Polepally, P R","Zielinska, M","Marynowski, M","Fabisiak, A","Murawska, N","Sobczak, K","Sacharczuk, M","Do Rego, J C","Roth, B L","Zjawiony, J K","Fichna, J"],"doi":"10.1111\/bph.13212","first_seen_on":"2015-06-05T10:34:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1476-5381"],"journal":"British Journal of Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1433500445,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26040667?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26040667?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26040667","pubdate":"2015-06-05T22:03:13+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Salvinorin A analogs PR-37 and PR-38 attenuate compound 48\/80-induced itch responses in mice.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/salvinorin-analogues-pr37-pr38-attenuate-compound-4880induced-itch-responses-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5190587,"mean":6.1260119420067,"rank":4320165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5190587,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175120,"mean":8.7708929699235,"rank":143216,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175120,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2115,"mean":4.2556348155156,"rank":1842,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2115,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":4.9881739130435,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
