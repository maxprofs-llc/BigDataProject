Data collected included details of the underlying diseases, treatments, and pretreatment and post-treatment central retinal thickness (CRT) measured by time-domain optical coherence tomography, visual acuity (VA), intraocular pressure (IOP), and lens status. The median follow-up time was 65 weeks (range, 59-93 weeks).\nFifteen DEX intravitreal implants were injected into 5 eyes over the follow-up period. Reduction of CME was achieved in all eyes within 12 weeks after the initial injection. VA improved in 4 eyes and was unchanged in 1 eye at 12 weeks; VA improved in 2 eyes, decreased in 2 eyes, and was unchanged in 1 eye at 52 weeks. Three of 5 eyes experienced IOP elevation \u226510 mm Hg during the follow-up period. IOP was ultimately controlled medically in all eyes. Significant lens opacification was documented in 2 eyes.\nDEX intravitreal implant can be considered as an effective adjunctive off-label treatment to pediatric macular edema caused by uveitis or IMT\/Coats disease; the safety profile of repeated treatment is acceptable.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006db8","authors":["Lei, Shaobo","Lam, Wai-Ching"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jcjo.2015.01.007","first_seen_on":"2015-06-05T12:30:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0008-4182"],"issue":"3","journal":"Canadian Journal of Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1433508202,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26040225?dopt=Abstract#pubmed"],"pmid":"26040225","pubdate":"2015-06-05T22:03:34+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Efficacy and safety of dexamethasone intravitreal implant for refractory macular edema in children.","type":"article","volume":"50","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/efficacy-safety-dexamethasone-intravitreal-implant-refractory-macular-edema-children"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5190587,"mean":6.1260119420067,"rank":3433724,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1540086,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5190587,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175120,"mean":8.7708901147221,"rank":115887,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":50928,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175120,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260,"mean":1.7612895752896,"rank":159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":92,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.66666666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"PE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/OCTMD\/status\/606800111864324096","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4098532],"posted_on":"2015-06-05T12:29:55+00:00","author":{"name":"Brandon Lujan, MD","url":"http:\/\/OCTMD.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/459117248297189376\/n_gr2d1r_normal.jpeg","description":"Medical Retina and Imaging Specialist with Expertise in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT).","id_on_source":"OCTMD","tweeter_id":"244660420","geo":{"lt":37.77493,"ln":-122.41942,"country":"US"},"followers":1320},"tweet_id":"606800111864324096"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/campos2075\/status\/606803496554348544","license":"datasift","rt":["OCTMD"],"citation_ids":[4098532],"posted_on":"2015-06-05T12:43:22+00:00","author":{"name":"eric campos","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/569360927364251648\/ucN7O-Im_normal.jpeg","description":"oftalm\u00f3logo","id_on_source":"campos2075","tweeter_id":"1324768956","geo":{"lt":-8.11599,"ln":-79.02998,"country":"PE"},"followers":610},"tweet_id":"606803496554348544"}]}}
