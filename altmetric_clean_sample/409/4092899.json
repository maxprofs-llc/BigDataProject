Genome-wide studies of human replication origins have shown that origins are organized into replication initiation zones. However, only few replication initiation zones have been described so far. Moreover, few origins were mapped in other mammalian species besides human and mouse. Here we analyzed pattern of short nascent strands in the X inactivation center (XIC) of vole Microtus levis in fibroblasts, trophoblast stem cells, and extraembryonic endoderm stem cells and confirmed origins locations by ChIP approach. We found that replication could be initiated in a significant part of XIC. We also analyzed state of XIC chromatin in these cell types. We compared origin localization in the mouse and vole XIC. Interestingly, origins associated with gene promoters are conserved in these species. The data obtained allow us to suggest that the X inactivation center of M. levis is one extended replication initiation zone.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Sherstyuk, Vladimir V","Shevchenko, Alexander I","Zakian, Suren M"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0128497","first_seen_on":"2015-06-04T10:48:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"6","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1462274134,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26038842?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26038842","pubdate":"2015-06-04T22:01:20+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Mapping of Replication Origins in the X Inactivation Center of Vole Microtus levis Reveals Extended Replication Initiation Zone.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mapping-replication-origins-x-inactivation-center-vole-microtus-levis-reveals-extended-replication-i"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7644999,"mean":6.5733031223765,"rank":5510664,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1861717,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7644999,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":218430,"mean":8.320846709915,"rank":140237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":65123,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":218430,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108749,"mean":10.241218872991,"rank":73884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":29537,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108749,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6345,"mean":9.3075907944515,"rank":4407,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1564,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6345,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
