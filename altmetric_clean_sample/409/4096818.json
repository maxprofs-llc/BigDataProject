Parents' ability to regulate their emotions is an important factor for psychological well-being of the family. In Chinese societies, emotional regulation may be more important in light of the cultural desirability of maintaining harmonious family relationships. The objectives of our randomized controlled trial were to test the effectiveness of our Effective Parenting Programme (EPP) to increase the use of emotional management strategies (primary outcome) and enhance the parent-child relationship (secondary outcome). We utilized design characteristics that promoted recruitment, retention, and intervention sustainability. We randomized a community sample of 412 Hong Kong middle- and low-income mothers of children aged 6-8 years to the EPP or attention control group. At 3, 6 and 12- month follow up, the Effective Parent Program group reported greater increases in the use of emotion management strategies during parent-child interactions, with small to medium effect size, and lower negative affect and greater positive affect, subjective happiness, satisfaction with the parent-child relationship, and family harmony, compared to the control group, with small to medium effect size. Our results provided evidence of effectiveness for a sustainable, preventive, culturally appropriate, cognitive behaviorally-based emotion management program, in a non-clinical setting for Chinese mothers.\nHKCTR-1190.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023ab","authors":["Fabrizio, Cecilia S","Lam, Tai Hing","Hirschmann, Malia R","Pang, Irene","Yu, Nancy Xiaonan","Wang, Xin","Stewart, Sunita M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.brat.2015.05.011","first_seen_on":"2015-06-05T06:26:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00057967","1873-622X"],"journal":"Behaviour Research & Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1435399745,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0005796715000947","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26112397?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26112397","pubdate":"2015-06-27T10:09:17+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Business And Management","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences"],"title":"Parental emotional management benefits family relationships: A randomized controlled trial in Hong Kong, China.","type":"article","volume":"71","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/parental-emotional-management-benefits-family-relationships-randomized-controlled-trial-hong-kong-ch"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5281486,"mean":6.2131255898695,"rank":2803332,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1791929,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5281486,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177005,"mean":8.8133519355496,"rank":99612,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":60124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177005,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1003,"mean":5.7153273453094,"rank":763,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":147,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1003,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":4.83168,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
