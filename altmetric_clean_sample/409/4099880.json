The slope of cortisol decline over the day in heavy drinkers was reduced (heavy drinkers beta=-0.155, moderate drinkers beta=-0.151), indicating reduced control of the HPA axis in heavy drinkers. In women the cortisol awakening response was greater in heavy drinkers 14.15 nmol\/liter (9.12-19.17) compared with moderate drinkers 8.69 nmol\/liter (7.72-9.67) (P=0.037).\nThis study suggests that alcohol consumption is associated with activation of the HPA axis. These results are not due to alcohol consumption on the day, suggesting chronic changes of the HPA axis in heavy drinking groups.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be1","authors":["Ellena Badrick","Martin Bobak","Annie Britton","Clemens Kirschbaum","Michael Marmot","Meena Kumari"],"doi":"10.1210\/jc.2007-0737","first_seen_on":"2015-06-05T15:58:01+00:00","issns":["0021-972X","1945-7197"],"issue":"3","journal":"The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1500364848,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2266962\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2266962\/"],"pmcid":"PMC2266962","pmid":"18073316","pubdate":"2008-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Endocrine Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"750","subjects":["metabolism","endocrinology"],"title":"The Relationship between Alcohol Consumption and Cortisol Secretion in an Aging Cohort","type":"article","volume":"93","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/relationship-between-alcohol-consumption-cortisol-secretion-aging-cohort"},"altmetric_score":{"score":16.58,"score_history":{"1y":13.33,"6m":13.08,"3m":9.08,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":16.58},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8229276,"mean":6.9710832737933,"rank":513857,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7715429,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8229276,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":221614,"mean":8.5549924688535,"rank":19324,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":202285,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":221614,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6980,"mean":8.4703516263075,"rank":523,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":6457,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6980,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79,"mean":12.740512820513,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":67,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Student  > Ph.
