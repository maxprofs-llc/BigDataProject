The adjusted relative odds for emotional, physical and sexual IPV among women with versus without CMI were 2.8 (CI = 1.9-4.0), 2.6 (CI = 1.6-4.3) and 5.4 (CI = 2.4-11.9), respectively. People with CMI were more likely to attempt suicide as result of IPV (aOR = 5.4, CI = 2.3-12.9), less likely to seek help from informal networks (aOR = 0.5, CI = 0.3-0.8) and more likely to seek help exclusively from health professionals (aOR = 6.9, CI = 2.6-18.3)ConclusionsPeople with CMI are not only at increased risk of all forms of IPV, but they are more likely to suffer subsequent ill health and to disclose exclusively to health professionals. Therefore, health professionals play a key role in addressing IPV in this population.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100057a0","authors":["Hind Khalifeh","Sian Oram","Kylee Trevillion","Sonia Johnson","Louise M.
