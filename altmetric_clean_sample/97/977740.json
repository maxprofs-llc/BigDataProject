This particular polysaccharide was found to stimulate the production of nitric oxide by inducing iNOS at the mRNA and protein levels. In addition, the polysaccharide also induced several cytokine mRNA expressions such as IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-alpha. Therefore, it appears that the sulfated galactan might possess the immunostimulating effects via activation of macrophages.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024a5","authors":["Lee JB","Ohta Y","Hayashi K","Hayashi T"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.carres.2010.02.026","first_seen_on":"2012-10-02T16:44:43+00:00","issns":["00086215"],"issue":"10","journal":"Carbohydrate Research","last_mentioned_on":1349111811,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0008621510000844"],"pmid":"20362278","pubdate":"2010-02-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","biochemistry"],"title":"Immunostimulating effects of a sulfated galactan from Codium fragile ","type":"article","volume":"345","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/immunostimulating-effects-sulfated-galactan-codium-fragile"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627464,"mean":4.9483847763613,"rank":2906207,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":74124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627464,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76467,"mean":5.1803879894332,"rank":56864,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":316,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76467,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267,"mean":1.9687067669173,"rank":182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":0.78571428571429,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
