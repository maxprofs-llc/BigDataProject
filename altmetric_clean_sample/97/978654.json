The SR1-encoded peptide SR1P binds GapA thereby stabilizing gapA mRNA. Under glycolytic conditions, SR1 transcription is repressed by CcpN and CcpA. A computer-based search identified 23 SR1 homologues in Bacillus, Geobacillus, Anoxybacillus and Brevibacillus species. All homologues share a high structural identity with Bacillus subtilis SR1, and the encoded SR1P peptides are highly similar. In the Bacillus cereus group, the sr1p region is present in triplicate or duplicate resulting in longer SR1 species. In all cases, sr1 expression is under control of CcpN, and transcriptional lacZ fusions of nine examined SR1 homologues were sensitive to glucose. Two homologues showed an additional glucose-independent repression by CcpN and an unknown factor. A total of 10 out of 11 tested SR1P homologues complemented a B. subtilis \u0394sr1 strain in their ability to stabilize gapA mRNA, but only five of them bound GapA tightly. In vitro binding assays with six SR1\/ahrC pairs suggest that-despite divergent primary sequences-the base-pairing function is also preserved. In summary, SR1 is an sRNA with two functions that have been conserved over \u22481 billion years.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f61000832f","authors":["Sabine Brantl"],"doi":"10.1093\/nar\/gks895","first_seen_on":"2012-10-03T04:38:47+00:00","issns":["1362-4962"],"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","last_mentioned_on":1355827500,"links":["http:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/10\/02\/nar.gks895.short?rss=1","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/nar\/gks895","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23034808","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3526287"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/10\/02\/nar.gks895.full.pdf","pmid":"23034808","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"SR1\u2014a small RNA with two remarkably conserved functions","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sr1a-small-rna-two-remarkably-conserved-functions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5032959,"mean":5.9653559095836,"rank":992315,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4035737,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5032959,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82779,"mean":5.7705887796274,"rank":15511,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":67181,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82779,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8914,"mean":3.7934304947829,"rank":1635,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":7264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8914,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":2.9635428571429,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
