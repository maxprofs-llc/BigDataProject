Usually basidiobolomycosis is a subcutaneous infection but rarely gastrointestinal manifestations have been described; 13 adults and 10 children and a few retroperitoneal or pulmonary cases. In gastrointestinal basidiobolomycosis the colon is most frequently involved, usually presenting with subacute mild abdominal pain. In contrast to children only very few described adult patients had hepatic masses. Definitive diagnosis requires culture, serological testing can be helpful. The fungal morphology and the Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon are characteristic histological features. There are no prominent risk factors. Usually surgery and prolonged antifungal therapy are required.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007bd","authors":["Guido EL van den Berk","Guido EL van den Berk","L Arnold Noorduyn","Ruud J van Ketel","Jeannouel van Leeuwen","Willem A Bemelman","Jan M Prins"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2334-6-140","first_seen_on":"2012-10-02T15:52:10+00:00","issns":["","1471-2334"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1349193095,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2334\/6\/140","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1471-2334-6-140","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16978407","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1574330"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/bmcinfectdis\/content\/pdf\/1471-2334-6-140.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1574330","pmid":"16978407","pubdate":"2006-09-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Parasitology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Tropical Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"140","subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"A fatal pseudo-tumour: disseminated basidiobolomycosis","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fatal-pseudotumour-disseminated-basidiobolomycosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5431054,"mean":6.3236310582857,"rank":1090425,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":4336234,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5431054,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84806,"mean":5.8876004245033,"rank":15995,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":68713,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84806,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2863,"mean":3.2564786862334,"rank":439,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":2420,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2863,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116,"mean":1.9117391304348,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
