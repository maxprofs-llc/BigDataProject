Traditionally, the endovascular approach to these patients has consisted of aortouniiliac devices combined with femoral-femoral bypass. With improved facility of endovascular techniques, standard bifurcated endografts represent an alternative option in these patients. This study examined outcomes of patients undergoing iliac recanalization and traditional bifurcated endovascular aneurysm repair in the face of access vessel occlusion.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f17","authors":["Farber, Mark A."],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jvs.2012.05.089","first_seen_on":"2012-10-01T13:05:32+00:00","issns":["0741-5214"],"journal":"Journal of Vascular Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1349096714,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0741521412012803"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jvascsurg.org\/article\/S0741-5214(12)01280-3\/pdf","pmid":"22960023","pubdate":"2012-09-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Iliac artery recanalization of chronic occlusions to facilitate endovascular aneurysm repair","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/iliac-artery-recanalization-chronic-occlusions-facilitate-endovascular-aneurysm-repair"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627150,"mean":4.9502167410311,"rank":2018499,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":931880,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627150,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76383,"mean":5.1602883401848,"rank":36581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":26962,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76383,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":895,"mean":2.0396263982103,"rank":362,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":288,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":895,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":1.0675,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
