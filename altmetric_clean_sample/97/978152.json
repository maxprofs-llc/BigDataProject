A system of classification relating the type of fracture to the method of Rush-pin fixation is described, and the importance of proper surgical technique is emphasized. The patients were followed for periods ranging from one to seventeen years (mean, 3.5 years) and 84 per cent of them had either excellent or good results, as evaluated by both radiographic and clinical examination. There were two non-unions and one deep infection. Angulation at the fracture site, the development of significant degenerative arthritis, and metal failure were not encountered. Properly performed, the Rush-pin supracondylar technique offers enough stability to allow early knee motion and has the advantages of both open and closed techniques in managing this type of fracture of the femur.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cd4","first_seen_on":"2012-10-02T20:22:02+00:00","issns":["0021-9355"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Bone & Joint Surgery, American Volume","last_mentioned_on":1349209302,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7056767"],"pmid":"7056767","pubdate":"1982-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics","generalsurgery"],"title":"Rush-pin fixation of supracondylar and intercondylar fractures of the femur.","type":"article","volume":"64","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rushpin-fixation-supracondylar-intercondylar-fractures-femur"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3071169,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":948615,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79970,"mean":5.5078098513174,"rank":51300,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":15949,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79970,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1490,"mean":4.3601544660846,"rank":1111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":279,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1490,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":3.5071428571429,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
