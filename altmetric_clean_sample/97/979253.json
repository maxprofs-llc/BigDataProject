In this paper, a comprehensive overview of microfluidic devices such as micropumps and microneedles has been presented for biomedical applications. The aim of this paper is to present the major features and issues related to micropumps and microneedles, e.g., working principles, actuation methods, fabrication techniques, construction, performance parameters, failure analysis, testing, safety issues, applications, commercialization issues and future prospects. Based on the actuation mechanisms, the micropumps are classified into two main types, i.e., mechanical and non-mechanical micropumps. Microneedles can be categorized according to their structure, fabrication process, material, overall shape, tip shape, size, array density and application. The presented literature review on micropumps and microneedles will provide comprehensive information for researchers working on design and development of microfluidic devices for biomedical applications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e6e","authors":["Muhammad Waseem Ashraf","Shahzadi Tayyaba","Nitin Afzulpurkar"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijms12063648","first_seen_on":"2012-10-03T14:05:07+00:00","issns":["1422-0067"],"issue":"6","journal":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1389268800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3131584\/"],"pmid":"21747700","pubdate":"2012-10-03T20:11:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"3648","title":"Micro Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) Based Microfluidic Devices for Biomedical Applications","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/micro-electromechanical-systems-mems-based-microfluidic-devices-biomedical-applications-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.152,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.152},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4282690,"mean":5.0215424405332,"rank":692345,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":3589658,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4282690,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78863,"mean":5.2162648677436,"rank":12674,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":66157,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78863,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1836,"mean":1.5662822888283,"rank":84,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":1753,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1836,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.9115714285714,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":23,"Student  > Doctoral Student":10,"Student  > Ph.
