Coffee has been already demonstrated to represent a worldwide appreciated beverage and its high economical value could induce frauds or adulteration practices involving both compositional and geographical aspects. In the last years, metabolic profiling revealed to be suitable to face the quality determination of food matrices and NMR confirmed its potentiality in metabolites characterization. The present study reports the capability of NMR spectroscopy to investigate the metabolite content of roasted Coffea arabica samples from the three main production areas, America, Africa and Asia. OPLS-DA models performed on (1)H NMR data led to a clear separation of samples according to their origin: fatty acids, chlorogenic acids and lactate and finally acetate and trigonelline resulted the main compounds characterizing the American, African and Asian samples respectively. The analytical approach here presented confirmed the potentiality of the joined NMR analysis and statistical treatments in quality determination of food matrices.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003609","authors":["Roberto Consonni","Laura Ruth Cagliani","Clelia Cogliati"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.talanta.2011.11.010","endpage":"426","first_seen_on":"2012-10-03T18:04:10+00:00","issns":["00399140"],"journal":"Talanta","last_mentioned_on":1312425180,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016%2Fj.talanta.2011.11.010"],"pmid":"22265520","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"420","title":"NMR based geographical characterization of roasted coffee","type":"article","volume":"88","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nmr-based-geographical-characterization-roasted-coffee"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.272,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.272},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3636264,"mean":4.9211313967159,"rank":556244,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":3078998,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3636264,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76430,"mean":5.1430597024689,"rank":11650,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":64711,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76430,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":876,"mean":1.0294514285714,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":856,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":876,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":0.53305084745763,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":59,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":98}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
