A 38-year-old man presented with a two-year history of incapacitating left suprascapular pain after a fall onto his outstretched hand. The history and clinical examination was suggestive of myofascial pain affecting the trapezius muscle. This had been unresponsive to pharmacological therapy, physiotherapy or suprascapular nerve blockade. Following identification of the spinal accessory nerve in the posterior triangle of the neck, we performed ultrasound-guided nerve blocks, first using a single injection of local anaesthetic and subsequently using a continuous infusion via a perineural catheter, to block the nerve and temporarily relieve the patient's pain. We have demonstrated that the spinal accessory nerve is identifiable in the posterior triangle of the neck and can be blocked successfully using ultrasound guidance. This technique can aid the diagnosis and treatment of myofascial pain originating from the trapezius muscle.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002242","authors":["Townsley, P.","Ravenscroft, A.","Bedforth, N."],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1365-2044.2011.06691.x","endpage":"389","first_seen_on":"2012-09-28T13:17:05+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1365-2044","0003-2409"],"issue":"5","journal":"Anaesthesia","last_mentioned_on":1348840623,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1365-2044.2011.06691.x\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1365-2044.2011.06691.x\/pdf","pmid":"21418047","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"386","subjects":["anesthesiology"],"title":"Ultrasound\u00e2\u0080\u0090guided spinal accessory nerve blockade in the diagnosis and management of trapezius muscle\u00e2\u0080\u0090related myofascial pain","type":"article","volume":"66","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ultrasoundguided-spinal-accessory-nerve-blockade-diagnosis-management-trapezius-musclerelated-myofas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6709003,"mean":6.1618098286434,"rank":3193252,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3490664,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6709003,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96184,"mean":5.5908400652922,"rank":43770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":51921,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96184,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2011,"mean":5.8985124378109,"rank":1273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":712,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2011,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":2.6609375,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
