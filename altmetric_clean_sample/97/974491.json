We report a case of a man with detrusor dysfunction who was having increasing difficulty performing clean intermittent self-catheterization of the bladder. The successful use of the 120 W lithium triborate laser to perform a \"mini-photoselective vaporization of the prostate\" (\"mini-PVP\") enabled discharge of the patient on the same day as well as resolution of the patient's difficulties in performing self-catheterization. Mini-PVP has proven to be a simple and effective approach to resolution of a prostate configuration impeding the process of clean intermittent self-catheterization.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8203cf058f61000bc63","authors":["Woo, Henry Hyunshik"],"doi":"10.4111\/kju.2012.53.9.654","first_seen_on":"2012-10-01T10:27:10+00:00","issns":["2005-6737"],"journal":"Korean Journal of Urology","last_mentioned_on":1383605515,"links":["http:\/\/synapse.koreamed.org\/DOIx.php?id=10.4111\/kju.2012.53.9.654","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/23061005\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/synapse.koreamed.org\/Synapse\/Data\/PDFData\/0020KJU\/kju-53-654.pdf","pmid":"23061005","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Mini-Photoselective Vaporization of the Prostate for Difficult Intermittent Self-Catheterization","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/miniphotoselective-vaporization-prostate-difficult-intermittent-selfcatheterization"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":1928802,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3067129,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82737,"mean":5.7463833397796,"rank":25094,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":56892,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82737,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147,"mean":1.893095890411,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.7083333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other Professional":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":3,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DrHenryWoo\/statuses\/260629692476977152","license":"public","citation_ids":[974491],"posted_on":"2012-10-23T06:32:15+00:00","author":{"name":"Henry Woo","url":"http:\/\/sydney.edu.au\/medicine\/people\/academics\/profiles\/henry.woo.php","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/856438786107899905\/vNaICy1m_normal.jpg","description":"Professor of Surgery & Discipline Head: SAH Clinical School.
