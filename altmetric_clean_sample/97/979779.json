The old dental units had been used for 13 years and the new dental units for 1 year. A fast method named Petrifilmtrade mark AC (3M) was employed to evaluate the level of water contamination with total aerobic bacteria and Petrifilmtrade mark EC for Escherichia coli and coliforms.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f61000599f","authors":["Watanabe E","Agostinho AM","Matsumoto W","Ito I"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1601-5037.2007.00278.x","first_seen_on":"2012-10-03T18:17:31+00:00","issns":["1601-5029"],"issue":"1","journal":"International Journal of Dental Hygiene","last_mentioned_on":1349288244,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18205655"],"pmid":"18205655","pubdate":"2008-01-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Dental unit water: bacterial decontamination of old and new dental units by flushing water.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dental-unit-water-bacterial-decontamination-old-new-dental-units-flushing-water"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4022308,"mean":5.0456959241201,"rank":2251517,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1037259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4022308,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77883,"mean":5.2258627410698,"rank":37581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":27342,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77883,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":213,"mean":2.4210283018868,"rank":113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":213,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":9,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
