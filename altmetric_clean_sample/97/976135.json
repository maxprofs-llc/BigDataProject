CoQ(10) is an essential cofactor in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, and is necessary for ATP production. Total, reduced and oxidized CoQ(10) levels in skeletal muscle of 148 children were determined by HPLC coupled with electrochemical detection, and we established three level thresholds for total CoQ(10) in muscle. We defined as \"severe deficiency\", CoQ(10) levels falling in the range between 0.82 and 4.88 \u03bcmol\/g tissue; as \"intermediate deficiency\", those ranging between 5.40 and 9.80 \u03bcmol\/g tissue, and as \"mild deficiency\", the amount of CoQ(10) included between 10.21 and 19.10 \u03bcmol\/g tissue. Early identification of CoQ(10) deficiency has important implications in children, not only for those with primary CoQ(10) defect, but also for patients with neurodegenerative disorders, in order to encourage earlier supplementation with this agent also in mild and intermediate deficiency.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51e3cf058f6100039bf","authors":["Anna Pastore","Gianna Di Giovamberardino","Sara Petrillo","Sara Boenzi","Enrico Bertini","Carlo Dionisi-Vici","Fiorella Piemonte"],"doi":"10.3109\/1354750x.2012.727029","endpage":"3","first_seen_on":"2012-10-02T03:10:57+00:00","issns":["1354-750X","1366-5804"],"journal":"Biomarkers","last_mentioned_on":1349591850,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/1354750X.2012.727029","http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/1354750X.2012.727029?ai=9jd&mi=3g0e8x&af=R&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&"],"pmid":"23020092","pubdate":"2012-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Biotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Pediatric reference intervals for muscle coenzyme Q10.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pediatric-reference-intervals-muscle-coenzyme-q-sub10sub"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":2086562,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":2384945,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79969,"mean":5.4623264305722,"rank":32607,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":46480,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79969,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267,"mean":1.0277067669173,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":0.69615384615385,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
