Our aim was to investigate whether nGOR is a risk factor for onset of asthma and onset of respiratory and OSA symptoms in a prospective population-based study. We invited 2640 subjects from Iceland, Sweden and Belgium for two evaluations over a 9-year interval. They participated in structured interviews, answered questionnaires, and underwent spirometries and methacholine challenge testing. nGOR was defined by reported symptoms. Subjects with persistent nGOR (n=123) had an independent increased risk of new asthma at follow-up (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1-4.9). Persistent nGOR was independently related to onset of respiratory symptoms (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.6-5.6). The risk of developing symptoms of OSA was increased in subjects with new and persistent nGOR (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.3-1.6, and OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.0-3.7, respectively). No significant association was found between nGOR and lung function or bronchial responsiveness. Persistent symptoms of nGOR contribute to the development of asthma and respiratory symptoms. New onset of OSA symptoms is higher among subjects with symptoms of nGOR. These findings provide evidence that nGOR may play a role in the genesis of respiratory symptoms and diseases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f610007384","doi":"10.1183\/09031936.00052512","first_seen_on":"2012-09-30T12:19:43+00:00","issns":["1399-3003"],"journal":"European Respiratory Journal","last_mentioned_on":1391083871,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23018910?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23018910","pubdate":"2012-09-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux, asthma and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea: a longitudinal, general population study.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nocturnal-gastrooesophageal-reflux-asthmaand-symptoms-osa-longitudinal-general-population-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":1911046,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":3108440,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82395,"mean":5.7576830108989,"rank":24750,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":57334,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82395,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2429,"mean":5.2824003294893,"rank":1044,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":1362,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2429,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":3.1776956521739,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
