So far, Ca(2+) signaling has been only characterized in cultured microglia and thus these data refer rather to activated microglia as observed in pathology when compared with the resting form found under physiological conditions. Purinergic receptors are the most prominently expressed ligand-gated Ca(2+)-permeable channels in microglia and control several microglial functions such as cytokine release in a Ca(2+)-dependent fashion. A large variety of metabotropic receptors are linked to Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores. Depletion of these intracellular stores triggers a capacitative Ca(2+) entry. While microglia are already in an activated state in culture, they can be further activated, for example, by exposure to bacterial endotoxin. This activation leads to a chronic increase of [Ca(2+)](i) and this Ca(2+) increase is a prerequisite for the release of nitric oxide and cytokines. Moreover, several factors (TNFalpha, IL-1beta, and IFN-gamma) regulate resting [Ca(2+)](i) levels.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f610007579","authors":["F\u00e4rber, Katrin","Kettenmann, Helmut"],"doi":"10.1002\/glia.20412","endpage":"665","first_seen_on":"2012-09-30T07:43:20+00:00","issns":["1098-1136"],"issue":"7","journal":"Glia","last_mentioned_on":1348990987,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/glia.20412\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/glia.20412\/pdf","pmid":"17006894","pubdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"656","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Functional role of calcium signals for microglial function","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/functional-role-calcium-signals-microglial-function-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632299,"mean":4.9243828402896,"rank":2898230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":81242,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632299,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76365,"mean":5.1346795348593,"rank":56542,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":489,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76365,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":518,"mean":2.19566344294,"rank":416,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":518,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.5333333333333,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
