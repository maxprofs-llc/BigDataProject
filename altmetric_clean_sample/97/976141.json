This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) in Germany in this context. A population-based Markov model was developed. A cohort of adults currently eligible for vaccination was followed until death. Adult vaccination with PPV23 was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of \u20ac17,065\/quality-adjusted life years gained from the third-party payer's perspective. Univariate sensitivity analyses showed that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was below \u20ac50,000\/quality-adjusted life years gained in most test scenarios. The model suggests that adult PPV23 vaccination is cost effective in Germany, due to its broad serotype coverage. This is despite epidemiological changes in Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes caused by wider use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines during childhood.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073d8","authors":["Yiling Jiang","Aline Gauthier","Lieven Annemans","Mark van der Linden","Laurence Nicolas-Spony","Xavier Bresse","Jiang Y","Gauthier A","Annemans L","van der Linden M","Nicolas-Spony L","Bresse X"],"doi":"10.1586\/erp.12.54","endpage":"16","first_seen_on":"2012-10-02T03:16:21+00:00","handle":"1854\/LU-3136244","handles":["1854\/LU-3136244"],"issns":["1473-7167","1744-8379"],"journal":"Expert Review of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research","last_mentioned_on":1367921161,"links":["http:\/\/www.expert-reviews.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1586\/erp.12.54","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1586\/ERP.12.54"],"pmid":"23025422","pubdate":"2012-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Applied Economics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Cost\u2013effectiveness of vaccinating adults with the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) in Germany","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/costeffectiveness-vaccinating-adults-23valent-pneumococcal-polysaccharide-vaccine-ppv23-germany"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2927213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1433021,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79969,"mean":5.5013317326931,"rank":48296,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":28499,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79969,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":326,"mean":1.3485723076923,"rank":142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":326,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":0.68529411764706,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
