Methods: We recruited women into a longitudinal prospective cohort following a pregnancy with or without preeclampsia. The prevalence of cardiometabolic factors were assessed at one- and three-years postpartum. A total of 217 women completed a visit at one year postpartum (n = 99 preeclampsia, n = 118 control subjects) and 120 completed a visit at three-years (n = 73 preeclampsia, n = 47 control subjects). Results: The prevalence of metabolic syndrome at one- and three-years postpartum was significantly greater in women who had preeclampsia (18.18% at one year, 21.92% at three-years) than in control subjects (6.78%, 6.38%) (P < 0.05), but did not change over time. Conclusions: Given the difficulty in following women long-term, either clinically or as part of study, and because cardiometabolic factors do not change significantly between one- and three-years postpartum, strategies for health preservation and disease prevention should be adopted in the first-year postpartum.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9283cf058f61000dd2c","authors":["Smith GN","Pudwell J","Walker M","Wen SW"],"first_seen_on":"2012-10-01T21:07:05+00:00","funders":["cihr"],"issns":["1701-2163"],"issue":"9","journal":"Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology Canada JOGC Journal d obst\u00e9trique et gyn\u00e9cologie du Canada JOGC","last_mentioned_on":1485392103,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22971452","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22971452"],"pmid":"22971452","pubdate":"2012-09-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Risk estimation of metabolic syndrome at one and three years after a pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia.","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/risk-estimation-metabolic-syndrome-one-three-years-after-pregnancy-complicated-preeclampsia-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":1.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082038,"mean":6.8946982576228,"rank":3317285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4722072,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082038,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102780,"mean":5.9413783360415,"rank":36141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":66008,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102780,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":362,"mean":3.6965817174515,"rank":152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":204,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":362,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.6181818181818,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/carynjrogers\/statuses\/252877294413152256","license":"public","citation_ids":[975610],"posted_on":"2012-10-01T21:06:59+00:00","author":{"name":"caryn","url":"http:\/\/www.preeclampsia.org\/research\/research-news","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/978298862\/profile_normal.jpg","description":"Science writer (vol) for the Preeclampsia Foundation, so a quasi-philosopher of biology and social epistemology.
