This is best understood for DNA methylation which, established at discrete regions of the oocyte and sperm genomes, governs genomic imprinting. In this review, we describe how imprinting has informed our understanding of de novo DNA methylation mechanisms, highlight how recent genome-wide profiling studies have provided unprecedented insights into establishment of the sperm and oocyte methylomes and consider the fate and function of gametic methylation and other epigenetic modifications after fertilization.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6163cf058f6100072c9","authors":["Stewart, Kathleen R","Veselovska, Lenka","Kelsey, Gavin","Kathleen R Stewart"],"doi":"10.2217\/epi-2016-0056","first_seen_on":"2016-09-24T16:40:23+00:00","funders":["niehs","mrc"],"issns":["1750-192X","1750-1911"],"journal":"Epigenomics","last_mentioned_on":1477923717,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27659720?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.futuremedicine.com\/doi\/full\/10.2217\/epi-2016-0056"],"pmid":"27659720","pubdate":"2016-09-23T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Establishment and functions of DNA methylation in the germline","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/establishment-functions-dna-methylation-germline"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.55,"score_history":{"1y":5.55,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7625034,"mean":6.5623772256419,"rank":1293724,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":6326492,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7625034,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243911,"mean":12.387420573162,"rank":60420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":183192,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243911,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":449,"mean":3.8641294642857,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":386,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":449,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":3.3664516129032,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":3,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
