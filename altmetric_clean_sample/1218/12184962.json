However, the mechanism underlying this protection is not well understood. In this study, we elucidated the role of HO-1 in Cd-induced cytotoxicity. Exposure of NRK52E cells to Cd induced protein kinase B (PKB)\/Akt, protein kinase C (PKC)-\u03b4, and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3\u03b1b phosphorylation, and eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2\u03b1 dephosphorylation. Pharmacological inhibition of Akt resulted in HO-1 suppression and eIF2\u03b1 activation, which partially suppressed CHOP and PARP-1 cleavage, but promoted autophagy and decreased cell viability. Pharmacological inactivation of PKC-\u03b4 markedly suppressed Cd-induced phospho-serine (p-Ser) GSK3\u03b1\u03b2, and HO-1, and partially inhibited PARP-1 cleavage, but massively induced autophagy and decreased cell viability. Pharmacological upregulation of p-Ser GSK3\u03b1\u03b2 enhanced Cd-induced HO-1, CHOP, and PARP-1 cleavage, but decreased autophagy. Genetic deficiency of GSK3\u03b2 suppressed HO-1 and PARP-1 cleavage and increased autophagy. Genetic suppression of HO-1 reduced Cd-induced PARP-1 cleavage, but increased LC3-II. Cd exposure led to accumulation of p-PKC-\u03b4, p-Ser GSK3\u03b1\u03b2, and HO-1 in the nucleus and particulate fractions, suggesting that they have dual functions in response to Cd. N-acetylcysteine treatment suppressed Cd-induced activation of PKC-\u03b4 and Akt. These results indicate that HO-1 induced by Cd exposure is regulated by PKC-\u03b4, p-Ser GSK3\u03b1\u03b2, and PKB\/Akt, which restrain autophagic cell death, but mildly induce apoptosis in NRK52E cells. Together, the results suggest that HO-1 expression in response to Cd maintains cellular homeostasis during oxidative stress.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003679","authors":["So, Keum-Young","Oh, Seon-Hee"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.tox.2016.09.010","first_seen_on":"2016-09-24T10:16:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-3185","0300483X"],"journal":"Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1474712173,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27658547?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27658547","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"title":"Cadmium-induced Heme-Oxygenase-1 Expression Plays Dual Roles in Autophagy and Apoptosis and is Regulated by both PKC-\u03b4 and PKB\/Akt Activation in NRK52E Kidney Cells","type":"article","volume":"370","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cadmiuminduced-hemeoxygenase1-expression-plays-dual-roles-autophagy-apoptosis-regulated-both-pkc%CE%B4-pk"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8425604,"mean":7.0878923279354,"rank":7280654,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8425604,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253612,"mean":12.663782540978,"rank":208780,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253612,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1864,"mean":4.0680515297907,"rank":1718,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1864,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":7.2846153846154,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
