Postural stability was measured using a force-balance platform eyes open\/closed on a firm\/foam surface under 3 test conditions: no touch, light touch, and unrestricted touch (UT), where \"touch\" involved placing their index finger on a rigid table. Average magnitude of center of foot pressure displacement was calculated. A somatosensory ratio (SR) was used to evaluate the somatosensory contribution to balance. A repeated measures ANOVA was used to investigate the effects of touch on standing balance.\nPatients had a significantly increased SR compared to control subjects (mean [SD] SR controls = 1.2 [0.2], patients = 1.9 [0.5]; P < 0.01). There was a significant effect of touch, vision, and surface on balance control (\"touch\" F = 68.1, P < 0.01; \"vision\" F = 20.1, P < 0.01; \"surface\" F = 200.8, P < 0.01). Light touch attenuated sway in patients and controls. The effects were greater in controls when their vision was removed, and greater in patients when their somatosensory system was disrupted. Light touch was as effective as UT in attenuating sway.\nThe results of this exploratory study suggest that patients with severe sight impairment show an increased somatosensory contribution to balance control compared to their normally sighted counterparts. Light touch significantly reduces sway amplitude in severely sight impaired adults when standing on the foam surface, that is, when the somatosensory system is perturbed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007a79","authors":["Kotecha, Aachal","Webster, Andrew Royston","Wright, Genevieve","Michaelides, Michel","Rubin, Gary Stuart"],"doi":"10.1167\/iovs.16-19606","first_seen_on":"2016-09-24T13:05:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1552-5783"],"issue":"11","journal":"Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science","last_mentioned_on":1475153915,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27661857?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27661857\/?i=1&from=michaelides%20m"],"pmid":"27661857","pubdate":"2016-09-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"5053","subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Standing Balance Stability and the Effects of Light Touch in Adults With Profound Loss of Vision\u2014An Exploratory Study","type":"article","volume":"57","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/standing-balance-stability-effects-light-touch-adults-profound-loss-visionan-exploratory-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451184,"mean":7.1040239874029,"rank":4016607,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4247001,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451184,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253867,"mean":12.665871412477,"rank":119544,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":126900,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253867,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2875,"mean":3.4677752261656,"rank":1010,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":1803,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2875,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101,"mean":2.646,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":70,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
