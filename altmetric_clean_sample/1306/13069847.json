A potent growth stimulating effect for microorganisms was observed with the PQQ adduct when it was administered in a culture medium. Although PQQ itself shows a marked growth stimulating effect, PQQ adducts appeared to be more active than authentic PQQ when compared on a molar basis. Conversely, unlike authentic PQQ, PQQ adducts were shown to be less active (greater than or equal to 100-fold) as the prosthetic group for a quinoprotein apo-glucose dehydrogenase when examined by holoenzyme formation by exogenous addition of PQQ or PQQ adducts. These observations suggested that PQQ adduct formation readily occurs during isolation procedures for PQQ from biological materials or PQQ - chromophore from quinoproteins. Therefore, the presence of such adducts gives a PQQ estimation much lower than theoretically expected. As an example, formation, isolation and characterization of PQQ - serine are described.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023cd","authors":["Adachi, O","Okamoto, K","Shinagawa, E","Matsushita, K","Ameyama, M"],"first_seen_on":"2016-10-27T07:00:36+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["0951-6433"],"issue":"3","journal":"Biofactors","last_mentioned_on":1444924680,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2855707"],"pmid":"2855707","pubdate":"1988-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Adduct formation of pyrroloquinoline quinone and amino acid.","type":"article","volume":"1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adduct-formation-pyrroloquinoline-quinone-amino-acid"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6497059,"mean":6.0162892730828,"rank":1142545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":5327461,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6497059,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":87888,"mean":11.347326248478,"rank":20041,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":67672,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":87888,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":385,"mean":2.9199166666667,"rank":54,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":330,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":385,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.7,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) \u2013 an unproved supplement","url":"http:\/\/pharmaceuticalintelligence.com\/2015\/10\/15\/pyrroloquinoline-quinone-pqq-an-unproved-supplement\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[3248593,13069827,1826472,13069828,13069829,13069829,3721861,800602,13069835,13069840,4103864,13069844,13069846,13069847,4104125,3257929,3248587,3248595,13069852,1415777,4104119,13069858,3255002,13069861,13069863,4104116,13069865,1911731,4104130,13069872,3242529,13069875,13069877,13069879,13069882,13069884,13069886,13069888,13069889,13069890,13069893,13069896,3140303,13069899,13069900,6589817,1585174,13069901,13069902,13069904,839550,13069906,13069907,1336972,13069911,13069913,13069915,3470425,2858022,13069926,13069933,13069935,13069937,13069942,13069943,13069944,3229250,13069945,4104109,4104118,4104108,1911166,13069948,1911127,13069950,13069951,13069952,13069953,13069954,9688394,13069955,13069958,4104115,13069961,13069963,13069967,4104113,1451370,4104120,13069970,10369492,13069971,13069972,13069973,13069977,13069978,3297959,4104111,4104112,4530142,1796951,4104106,13069982,4104123,4103860,4103866,1539209,13069983,1349659,4080127,13069984,13069985,160431,13069988,13069989,13069990,163990,13069994,1278018,13069995,13069997,1790121,4103861,13069998,13070000,13070001,5756071,13070003,13070006,13070009,13070010,13070012,13070013,1371409,13070017,13070019,13070021,13070022,13070024,13070025,13070026,4104126,13070030,13070031,2621587,639002,4191853,4103863,4103865,13070035,13070037,3248593,3248599,3248599,3242529,3243428,3248605,3248613,3256490,3256494,3248594,839550,839550,839550,4103860,4103860,1539209,1539209,4103866,4103866,4103866,4103861,4103861,4103861,13070056,4104123,1796951,1796951,1796951,4104115,6010877,639002,4104111,4104111,4104114,4104114,13070060,4104125],"posted_on":"2015-10-15T15:58:00+00:00","summary":"Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) &ndash; an unproved supplement Larry H.
