However, little attention was paid to SIC dynamics in cropland. We conducted a survey in the upper Yellow River Delta of North China Plain. We collected 155 soil samples from 31 profiles, and measured SOC, SIC and soluble Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) contents. Our results showed that mean SOC content decreased from 9.30\u2009g kg(-1) near the surface to 2.36\u2009g kg(-1) in 80-100\u2009cm whereas mean SIC content increased from 10.48 to 12.72\u2009g kg(-1). On average, SOC and SIC stocks over 0-100\u2009cm were 5.73\u2009kg C m(-2) and 16.89\u2009kg C m(-2), respectively. There was a significantly positive correlation (r\u2009=\u20090.88, P\u2009<\u20090.001) between SOC and SIC in the cropland. We also found that SIC had a significantly positive correlation with both soluble Ca(2+) (r\u2009=\u20090.57, P\u2009<\u20090.01) and Mg(2+) (r\u2009=\u20090.43, P\u2009<\u20090.05). Our study suggested that increasing SOC might lead to an increase in SIC stocks in the cropland of North China Plain. This study highlights the importance of SIC in the carbon cycle of China's semi-arid region.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Yang Guo","Xiujun Wang","Xianglan Li","Jiaping Wang","Minggang Xu","Dongwei Li"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep36105","first_seen_on":"2016-10-27T02:35:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1477535701,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep36105"],"pmid":"27782204","pubdate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Carbon cycle","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Biogeochemistry","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"36105","subjects":["science"],"title":"Dynamics of soil organic and inorganic carbon in the cropland of upper Yellow River Delta, China","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dynamics-soil-organic-inorganic-carbon-cropland-upper-yellow-river-delta-china"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7601780,"mean":6.5482482934541,"rank":6582323,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7601780,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235327,"mean":12.67430759882,"rank":191958,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235327,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29542,"mean":14.867961477269,"rank":25285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29542,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3026,"mean":15.95013553719,"rank":2593,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3026,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
