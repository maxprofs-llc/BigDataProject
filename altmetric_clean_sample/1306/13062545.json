Thereby the chemokine CXC-motif ligand 10 (CXCL10) plays an important role in the recruitment of autoaggressive lymphocytes to the islets of Langerhans. Transplantation of isolated islets as a promising therapy of T1D has been hampered by early graft rejection. Here, we investigated the influence of CXCL10 on the autoimmune destruction of islet iso-grafts using RIP-LCMV mice expressing a lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) protein in the \u03b2-cells. RIP-LCMV islets express CXCL10 after isolation and maintain CXCL10 production after engraftment. Thus, we isolated islets from either normal or CXCL10-deficient RIP-LCMV mice and transferred them under the kidney capsule of diabetic RIP-LCMV mice. We found that the autoimmune destruction of CXCL10-deficient islet iso-grafts was significantly reduced. The autoimmune destruction was also diminished in mice administered with an anti-CXCL10 antibody. The persistent protection from autoimmune destruction was paralleled by an increase of FoxP3-positive regulatory T-cells within the cellular infiltrates around the islet iso-grafts. Consequently, CXCL10 might influence the cellular composition locally in the islet graft, thereby playing a role in the autoimmune destruction. CXCL10 might therefore constitute a potential therapeutic target to prolong islet graft survival.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026f7","authors":["Christine Bender","Selina Christen","Klaus Scholich","Monika Bayer","Josef M.
