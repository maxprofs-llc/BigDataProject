By substituting the common subnetwork model with a simpler local subnetwork model, LEAN allows exact, parameter-free, efficient, and exhaustive identification of local subnetworks that are statistically dysregulated, and directly implicates single genes for follow-up experiments.Evaluation on simulated and biological data suggests that LEAN generally detects dysregulated subnetworks better, and reflects biological similarity between experiments more clearly than standard approaches. A strong signal for the local subnetwork around Von Willebrand Factor (VWF), a gene which showed no change on the mRNA level, was identified by LEAN in transcriptome data in the context of the genetic disease Cerebral Cavernous Malformations (CCM). This signal was experimentally found to correspond to an unexpected strong cellular effect on the VWF protein. LEAN can be used to pinpoint statistically significant local subnetworks in any genome-scale data set.\nThe R-package LEANR implementing LEAN is supplied as supplementary material and available on CRAN (https:\/\/cran.r-project.org).\nbenno@pasteur.fr, tournier-lasserve@univ-paris-diderot.fr.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023d2","authors":["Frederik Gwinner","Gw\u00e9nola Boulday","Claire Vandiedonck","Minh Arnould","C\u00e9cile Cardoso","Iryna Nikolayeva","Oriol Guitart-Pla","C\u00e9cile V.
