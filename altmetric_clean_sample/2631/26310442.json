Paired t-tests revealed that aerobic gymnastic exercise participants had improved significantly in perceived stress and fatigue after 4 weeks gymnastic exercise; these positive effects extended to the 12-week posttests. In addition, the changes in physical symptoms-related sleep inefficiency after 12 weeks gymnastic exercise were significantly decreased in the experimental group compared with the control group.\nThe findings can be used to encourage postnatal women to perform moderate-intensity gymnastic exercise in their daily life to reduce their stress, fatigue and improve sleep quality.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b81","authors":["Chiu-Ling Yang","Chung-Hey Chen"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijnurstu.2017.09.009","first_seen_on":"2017-09-19T12:53:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["00207489","1873-491X"],"journal":"International Journal of Nursing Studies","last_mentioned_on":1506597865,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S002074891730216X?dgcid=raven_sd_aip_email","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S002074891730216X","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28950158?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28950158","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing"],"title":"Effectiveness of aerobic gymnastic exercise on stress, fatigue, and sleep quality during postpartum: A pilot randomized controlled trial","type":"article","volume":"77","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effectiveness-aerobic-gymnastic-exercise-stress-fatigue-sleep-quality-during-postpartum-pilot-random"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":2,"3m":2,"1m":2,"1w":2,"6d":1.25,"5d":0.25,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462498,"mean":7.1083922572655,"rank":3681818,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4658863,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462498,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126045,"mean":11.783055266415,"rank":48204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":75541,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126045,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1172,"mean":6.3608061485909,"rank":724,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":425,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1172,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":4.984375,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Nursing and Health Professions":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IJNSJournal\/statuses\/910123856404389889","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26310442],"posted_on":"2017-09-19T12:50:11+00:00","author":{"name":"IJNS nursing journal","url":"http:\/\/www.journalofnursingstudies.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/515092876401713152\/B4M_9NPW_normal.jpeg","description":"International Journal of Nursing Studies.
