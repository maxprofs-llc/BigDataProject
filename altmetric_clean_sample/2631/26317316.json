Synchrotron X-ray diffraction shows a cubic pyrochlore structure with space group Fd3\u0305m. Rietveld structural analysis reveals a large cation mixed occupancy at both A and B sites by about 40%, the greatest value found in the pyrochlore family. In combination with the X-ray absorption spectroscopy results, the specific chemical composition and charge states are determined to be (Co0.6Pb0.4)(3+)2(Pb0.6Co0.4)(4+)2O7, in which both the A-site Co(3+) and the B-site Co(4+) are low-spin. Due to the tetrahedral geometric frustration effects as well as the random Co(4+) and Pb(4+) distribution at the B site, spin glassy behavior is well observed following the conventional critical slowing down feature in Pb2Co2O7.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Junye Yang","Jianhong Dai","Zhehong Liu","Runze Yu","Hajime Hojo","Zhiwei Hu","Tunwen Pi","Yunliang Soo","Changqing Jin","Masaki Azuma","Youwen Long"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.7b01646","first_seen_on":"2017-09-19T15:35:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0020-1669","1520-510X"],"journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1505835297,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.7b01646"],"pmid":"28920686","pubdate":"2017-09-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"High-Pressure Synthesis of the Cobalt Pyrochlore Oxide Pb2Co2O7 with Large Cation Mixed Occupancy","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8436356,"mean":7.0937825748122,"rank":7289571,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8436356,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111871,"mean":11.79007215518,"rank":91369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111871,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9309,"mean":1.1446130210572,"rank":5296,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9309,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156,"mean":1.5521935483871,"rank":105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/InorganicNews\/statuses\/910165321499025409","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26317316],"posted_on":"2017-09-19T15:34:57+00:00","author":{"name":"Inorganic News","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1636129253\/DSC01061_2_normal.JPG","description":"News, comments and publications about Inorganic Chemistry.","id_on_source":"InorganicNews","tweeter_id":"411132501","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1295},"tweet_id":"910165321499025409"}]}}
