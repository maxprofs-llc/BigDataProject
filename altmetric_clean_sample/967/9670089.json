An Ala25Thr (A25T) polymorphism in Cys C has been associated with both macular degeneration and late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Previously, studies have suggested that this polymorphism may compromise the secretion of Cys C. Interestingly, we found that untagged A25T, A25T tagged C-terminally with FLAG, or A25T FLAG followed by green fluorescent protein (GFP), were all secreted as efficiently from immortalized human cells as their wild-type (WT) counterparts (e.g., 112%, 100%, and 88% of WT levels from HEK-293T cells, respectively). Supporting these observations, WT and A25T Cys C variants also showed similar intracellular steady state levels. Furthermore, A25T Cys C did not activate the unfolded protein response and followed the same canonical endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi trafficking pathway as WT Cys C. WT Cys C has been shown to undergo signal sequence cleavage between residues Gly26 and Ser27. While the A25T polymorphism did not affect Cys C secretion, we hypothesized that it may alter where the Cys C signal sequence is preferentially cleaved. Under normal conditions, WT and A25T Cys C have the same signal sequence cleavage site after Gly26 (referred to as 'site 2' cleavage). However, in particular circumstances when the residues around site 2 are modified (such as by the presence of an N-terminal FLAG tag immediately after Gly26, or by a Gly26Lys (G26K) mutation), A25T has a significantly higher likelihood than WT Cys C of alternative signal sequence cleavage after Ala20 ('site 1') or even earlier in the Cys C sequence. Overall, our results indicate that the A25T polymorphism does not cause a significant reduction in Cys C secretion, but instead predisposes the protein to be cleaved at an alternative signal sequence cleavage site if site 2 is hindered. Additional N-terminal amino acids resulting from alternative signal sequence cleavage may, in turn, affect the protease inhibition function of Cys C.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Nguyen, Annie","Hulleman, John D"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0147684","first_seen_on":"2016-07-14T05:10:03+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"2","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1468472975,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26845025?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26845025","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Evidence of Alternative Cystatin C Signal Sequence Cleavage Which Is Influenced by the A25T Polymorphism.","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evidence-alternative-cystatin-c-signal-sequence-cleavage-influenced-a25t-polymorphism"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8071125,"mean":6.8533209909723,"rank":4266875,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2240169,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8071125,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258852,"mean":11.690777227053,"rank":141445,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":91820,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258852,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112369,"mean":10.55238418411,"rank":65423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":35691,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112369,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4398,"mean":10.652172390266,"rank":2758,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":1214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4398,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
