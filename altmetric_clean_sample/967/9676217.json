Seven patients had adenoid cystic carcinoma, 2 had carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma, and 1 each had high-grade and low-grade adenocarcinoma. Ten patients underwent postoperative radiotherapy, median 60 Gy (range, 52-64 Gy), 6 with concurrent chemotherapy. At a median of 30 months after radiation, all patients had dry eye syndrome, and 1 patient had severe corneal and conjunctival damage leading to enucleation. All 11 patients were disease free at last contact, median follow-up after surgery of 33 months.\nAn eye-sparing approach with surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy is feasible for selected patients with lacrimal gland carcinoma and is associated with a reasonable locoregional control and ocular toxicity profile. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
