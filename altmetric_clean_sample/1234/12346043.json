We present a case of simultaneous metastatic leiomyomatosis to the lungs and peritoneal cavity following laparoscopic myomectomy with power morcellation. The patient presented to our institution for further management where she underwent a robotically assisted hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Leiomyomatous implants measuring up to 2.4 cm were resected from bowel mesentery and bladder peritoneum. Subsequent serial computed tomography imaging confirmed stable pulmonary nodules without new intraperitoneal lesions. Increasing number of cases involving extrauterine spread of leiomyomas has been reported with the introduction of power morcellation. The exact pathogenesis is unknown but is likely multifactorial. We emphasize that although the incidence of spread of benign disease is low, it is important to recognize this phenomenon as we will likely continue to encounter similar cases in the coming years.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6183cf058f610007415","authors":["Park, Beau Y.","Leslie, Kevin O.","Chen, Longwen","Vaszar, Laszlo T.","Cornella, Jeffrey L.","Park, Beau Y","Leslie, Kevin O","Vaszar, Laszlo T","Cornella, Jeffrey L"],"doi":"10.1097\/spv.0000000000000342","first_seen_on":"2016-09-30T21:35:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2151-8378","2154-4212"],"journal":"Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1480706332,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jpelvicsurgery\/Abstract\/publishahead\/A_Case_of_Simultaneous_Benign_Metastasizing.99799.aspx","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27748666"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jpelvicsurgery\/9000\/00000\/A_Case_of_Simultaneous_Benign_Metastasizing.99799.pdf","pmid":"27748666","pubdate":"2016-09-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["generalsurgery","gynecology"],"title":"A Case of Simultaneous Benign Metastasizing Leiomyomas and Disseminated Peritoneal Leiomyomatosis Following Endoscopic Power Morcellation for Uterine Disease","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jpelvicsurgery\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/A_Case_of_Simultaneous_Benign_Metastasizing.99799.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/case-simultaneous-benign-metastasizing-leiomyomas-disseminated-peritoneal-leiomyomatosis-following-e"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":2.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7836572,"mean":6.6415682037409,"rank":3125251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4655188,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7836572,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245358,"mean":12.524871913171,"rank":92278,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":151161,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245358,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":705,"mean":1.5453892045455,"rank":99,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":604,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":705,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":1.091935483871,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2},"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/WKWomensHealth\/statuses\/781970589145673729","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12346043],"posted_on":"2016-09-30T21:34:51+00:00","author":{"name":"WK WomensHealth","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/562714651104788480\/5l0_gER9_normal.jpeg","description":"Updates from Wolters Kluwer's Women's Health journals and other OB\/GYN news.
