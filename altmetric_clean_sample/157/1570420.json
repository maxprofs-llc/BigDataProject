The role of specific immunoglobulin against Prototheca in host immunity is uncertain. We describe a case of persistent cutaneous protothecosis in a patient with hypogammaglobulinemia most likely due to common variable immunodeficiency, with clinical response to voriconazole.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"521611563cf058827c000010","authors":["Jason C.
