Acute ammonia toxicity can be mediated by an excitotoxic mechanism, oxidative stress and nitric oxide (NO) production. Astrocytes interact with neurons, providing metabolic support and protecting against oxidative stress and excitotoxicity. Astrocytes also convert excess ammonia and glutamate into glutamine via glutamine synthetase (GS). Resveratrol, a polyphenol found in grapes and red wines, exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and modulates glial functions, such as glutamate metabolism. We investigated the effect of resveratrol on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), GS activity, S100B secretion, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 levels in astroglial cells exposed to ammonia. Ammonia induced oxidative stress, decreased GS activity and increased cytokines release, probably by a mechanism dependent on protein kinase A (PKA) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways. Resveratrol prevented ammonia toxicity by modulating oxidative stress, glial and inflammatory responses. The ERK and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) are involved in the protective effect of resveratrol on cytokines proinflammatory release. In contrast, other antioxidants (e.g., ascorbic acid and trolox) were not effective against hyperammonemia. Thus, resveratrol could be used to protect against ammonia-induced neurotoxicity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Larissa Daniele Bobermin","Andr\u00e9 Quincozes-Santos","Maria Cristina Guerra","Marina Concli Leite","Diogo Onofre Souza","Carlos-Alberto Gon\u00e7alves","Carmem Gottfried"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0052164","first_seen_on":"2013-06-23T09:23:34+00:00","issns":[""],"issue":"12","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1371982173,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3528750\/"],"pmid":"23284918","pubdate":"2013-06-23T20:12:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Resveratrol Prevents Ammonia Toxicity in Astroglial Cells","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/resveratrol-prevents-ammonia-toxicity-astroglial-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635015,"mean":4.9193540767705,"rank":1450165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2140075,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635015,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85296,"mean":7.1869487777714,"rank":28326,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":55785,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85296,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64130,"mean":8.2570915810321,"rank":22760,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":40264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64130,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3564,"mean":10.756643839461,"rank":1388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":2127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3564,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
