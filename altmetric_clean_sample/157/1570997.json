High-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) is becoming widely used for this purpose because it provides an accurate determination of a variety of photosynthetic pigments simultaneously. This technique has a drawback compared with conventional spectroscopic techniques, however, in that it is more prone to structural modification of pigments during extraction, thus potentially generating erroneous results. During pigment extraction procedures with acetone or alcohol, the phytol side chain of chlorophyll is sometimes removed, forming chlorophyllide, which affects chlorophyll measurement using HPLC.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000088b","doi":"10.1186\/1746-4811-9-19","first_seen_on":"2013-06-21T04:01:45+00:00","issns":["1746-4811"],"issue":"1","journal":"Plant Methods","last_mentioned_on":1389029551,"links":["http:\/\/www.plantmethods.com\/content\/9\/1\/19\/abstract","http:\/\/www.plantmethods.com\/content\/pdf\/1746-4811-9-19.pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.plantmethods.com\/content\/pdf\/1746-4811-9-19.pdf","pmid":"23783080","pubdate":"2013-06-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural Biotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"19","title":"Simple extraction methods that prevent the artifactual conversion of chlorophyll to chlorophyllide during pigment isolation from leaf samples","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/simple-extraction-methods-prevent-artifactual-conversion-chlorophyll-chlorophyllide-during-pigment-i"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.05,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6232855,"mean":5.9627156798492,"rank":1060852,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":5167307,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6232855,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99377,"mean":7.4366422274997,"rank":20444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":78818,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99377,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":212,"mean":5.1938483412322,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":161,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":212,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":10.719538461538,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
