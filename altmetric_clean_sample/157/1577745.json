Host defense mechanisms against S. aureus are incompletely understood. Interleukin 19 (IL-19), IL-20 and IL-24 signal through type I and type II IL-20 receptors and are associated with inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. We found here that those cytokines promoted cutaneous infection with S. aureus in mice by downregulating IL-1\u03b2- and IL-17A-dependent pathways. We noted similar effects of those cytokines in human keratinocytes after exposure to S. aureus, and antibody blockade of the IL-20 receptor improved outcomes in infected mice. Our findings identify an immunosuppressive role for IL-19, IL-20 and IL-24 during infection that could be therapeutically targeted to alter susceptibility to infection.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003165","authors":["Ian A Myles","Natalia M Fontecilla","Patricia A Valdez","Paul J Vithayathil","Shruti Naik","Yasmine Belkaid","Wenjun Ouyang","Sandip K Datta"],"doi":"10.1038\/ni.2637","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2013-06-23T19:53:46+00:00","funders":["niaid"],"issns":["1529-2908","1529-2916"],"journal":"Nature Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1387152000,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/ni.2637","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/ni.2637"],"pmid":"23793061","pubdate":"2013-06-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Signaling via the IL-20 receptor inhibits cutaneous production of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-17A to promote infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/signaling-via-il20-receptor-inhibits-cutaneous-production-il1%CE%B2-il17a-promote-infection-methicillinre"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629591,"mean":4.9337473984712,"rank":1807967,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1644842,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629591,"percentile":45},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85193,"mean":7.2153389754908,"rank":38615,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":41515,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85193,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1557,"mean":4.8556722365039,"rank":734,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":774,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1557,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":8.5131219512195,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":23,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
