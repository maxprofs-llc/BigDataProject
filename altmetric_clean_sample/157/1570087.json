We identified a discriminatory sensor by using Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) of one major commensal species, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), triggered interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) production, which protected mice from experimental colitis. The LAB-induced IFN-\u03b2 response was diminished by dsRNA digestion and treatment with endosomal inhibitors. Pathogenic bacteria contained less dsRNA and induced much less IFN-\u03b2 than LAB, and dsRNA was not involved in pathogen-induced IFN-\u03b2 induction. These results identify TLR3 as a sensor to small intestinal commensal bacteria and suggest that dsRNA in commensal bacteria contributes to anti-inflammatory\u00a0and protective immune responses.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a95","authors":["Tadaomi Kawashima","Akemi Kosaka","Huimin Yan","Zijin Guo","Ryosuke Uchiyama","Ryutaro Fukui","Daisuke Kaneko","Yutaro Kumagai","Dong-Ju You","Joaquim Carreras","Satoshi Uematsu","Myoung\u00a0Ho Jang","Osamu Takeuchi","Tsuneyasu Kaisho","Shizuo Akira","Kensuke Miyake","Hiroko Tsutsui","Takashi Saito","Ikuko Nishimura","Noriko\u00a0M.
