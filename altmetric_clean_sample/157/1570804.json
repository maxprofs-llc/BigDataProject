This study seeks to understand why insured patients use EDs rather than more appropriate medical alternatives available to reduce the strain they are placing on this critical portal of entry. This exploratory research study surveyed insured patients presenting to 1 of 4 Central Florida EDs. Factor analysis and cluster analysis were used to identify groups of insured ED users defined by motivating factors. This study found that there exists a disconnect between insured individuals and the primary care system.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f610005918","doi":"10.1097\/hcm.0b013e3181e8e077","first_seen_on":"2013-06-21T03:52:18+00:00","issns":["1525-5794"],"issue":"3","journal":"Health Care Manager","last_mentioned_on":1341545706,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/healthcaremanagerjournal\/Abstract\/2010\/07000\/Emergency_Department_Utilization_by_Insured_Users_.2.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/healthcaremanagerjournal\/2010\/07000\/Emergency_Department_Utilization_by_Insured_Users_.2.pdf","pmid":"20686391","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Nursing","Social Sciences"],"startpage":"199","subjects":["healthservices"],"title":"Emergency Department Utilization by Insured Users: A Study of Motivating Factors","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/emergency-department-utilization-insured-users-study-motivating-factors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629051,"mean":4.9368884016521,"rank":2901692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":77524,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629051,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85200,"mean":7.1370268665127,"rank":67803,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":275,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85200,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":204,"mean":1.325960591133,"rank":171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":204,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":1,"Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":7,"Chemistry":1,"Social Sciences":5,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"CA":1,"US":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Emergency Department Utilization by Insured Users: A Study o... : The Health Care Manager","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=362457570491520&id=189941504397703","license":"public","citation_ids":[1570804],"posted_on":"2012-07-06T03:35:06+00:00","summary":"Most Popular:","author":{"name":"The Health Care Manager","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/189941504397703","facebook_wall_name":"The Health Care Manager","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/189941504397703\/picture","id_on_source":"189941504397703"}}]}}
