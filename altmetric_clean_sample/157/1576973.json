We investigated whether the ratio of apolipoprotein B (apoB) to apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1), an indicator of the balance between atherogenic and atheroprotective cholesterol transport could predict occult coronary atherosclerosis detected by MDCT. We collected the data of 1,401 subjects (877 men and 524 women) who participated in a routine health screening examination of Asan Medical Center. Significant coronary artery stenosis defined as > 50% stenosis was detected in 114 subjects (8.1%). An increase in apoB\/A1 quartiles was associated with increased percentages of subjects with significant coronary stenosis and noncalcified plaques (NCAP). After adjustment for confounding variables, each 0.1 increase in serum apoB\/A1 was significantly associated with increased odds ratios (ORs) for coronary stenosis and NCAP of 1.23 and 1.18, respectively. The optimal apoB\/A1 ratio cut off value for MDCT detection of significant coronary stenosis was 0.58, which had a sensitivity of 70.2% and a specificity of 48.2% (area under the curve, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.58-0.63, P < 0.001). Our results indicate that apoB\/A1 ratio is a good indicator of occult coronary atherosclerosis detected by coronary MDCT.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007d0e","authors":["Chang Hee Jung","Jenie Yoonoo Hwang","Mi Seon Shin","Ji Hee Yu","Eun Hee Kim","Sung Jin Bae","Dong Hyun Yang","Joon-Won Kang","Joong-Yeol Park","Hong-Kyu Kim","Woo Je Lee"],"doi":"10.3346\/jkms.2013.28.5.709","first_seen_on":"2013-06-23T03:52:49+00:00","issns":["1011-8934"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Korean Medical Science","last_mentioned_on":1371966921,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3653083\/"],"pmid":"23678262","pubdate":"2013-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Korean Academy of Medical Sciences","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"709","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Association of Apolipoprotein B\/Apolipoprotein A1 Ratio and Coronary Artery Stenosis and Plaques Detected by Multi-Detector Computed Tomography in Healthy Population","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-apolipoprotein-bapolipoprotein-a1-ratio-coronary-artery-stenosis-plaques-detected-multid"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4510149,"mean":5.2636614770391,"rank":1990695,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":2498638,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4510149,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89503,"mean":7.5062062523744,"rank":36353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":52593,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89503,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":454,"mean":1.6967240618102,"rank":112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":338,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":454,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":1.0294117647059,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"BE":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Association of Apolipoprotein B\/Apolipoprotein A1 Ratio and Coronary Artery Stenosis and Plaques...","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/100001757635057\/posts\/479534715448445","license":"public","citation_ids":[1576973],"posted_on":"2013-06-23T04:00:18+00:00","summary":"A test worth having even if you have to pay for it .
