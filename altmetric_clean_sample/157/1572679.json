One reason might be that they do not acquire complete and functional sequences of behaviour. The dynamic developmental theory of ADHD proposes that reinforcement and extinction processes are inefficient because of hypofunctioning dopamine systems, resulting in a narrower time window for associating antecedent stimuli and behaviour with its consequences. One effect of this may be that the learning of behavioural sequences is delayed, and that only short behavioural sequences are acquired in ADHD. The present study investigated acquisition of response sequences in the behaviour of children with ADHD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007de","doi":"10.1186\/1744-9081-1-12","first_seen_on":"2013-06-21T06:38:57+00:00","issns":["1744-9081"],"issue":"1","journal":"Behavioral and Brain Functions","last_mentioned_on":1371333282,"links":["http:\/\/www.behavioralandbrainfunctions.com\/content\/1\/1\/12"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.behavioralandbrainfunctions.com\/content\/pdf\/1744-9081-1-12.pdf","pmid":"16060963","pubdate":"2005-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Behavioral Therapy","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"12","subjects":["brain","behavioralsciences"],"title":"Moment-to-moment dynamics of ADHD behaviour","type":"article","volume":"1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/behavioral-brain-functions-momenttomoment-dynamics-adhd-behaviour"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628675,"mean":4.9393923648184,"rank":2902597,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":76743,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628675,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85186,"mean":7.1391975112991,"rank":67817,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85186,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253,"mean":3.1852857142857,"rank":174,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":3.5642857142857,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
