However, the accretion of the enamel cap yields thickness variations that alter the morphology and the topography of the enamel-dentine junction (i.e., the differential deposition of enamel by the ameloblasts create an external surface that does not necessarily perfectly parallel the enamel-dentine junction). This self-reliant influence of the enamel on tooth morphology is poorly understood and still under-investigated. Studies considering the relationship between enamel and dentine morphologies are rare, and none of them tackled this relationship in a quantitative way. Major limitations arose from: (1) the difficulties to characterize the tooth morphology in its comprehensive tridimensional aspect and (2) practical issues in relating enamel and enamel-dentine junction quantitative traits. We present new aspects of form representation based exclusively on 3D analytical tools and procedures. Our method is applied to a set of 21 unworn upper second molars belonging to eight extant anthropoid genera. Using geometrical analysis of polygonal meshes representatives of the tooth form, we propose a 3D dataset that constitutes a detailed characterization of the enamel and of the enamel-dentine junction morphologies. Also, for the first time, to our knowledge, we intend to establish a quantitative method for comparing enamel and enamel-dentine junction surfaces descriptors (elevation, inclination, orientation, etc.). New indices that allow characterizing the occlusal morphology are proposed and discussed. In this note, we present technical aspects of our method with the example of anthropoid molars. First results show notable individual variations and taxonomic heterogeneities for the selected topographic parameters and for the pattern and strength of association between enamel-dentine junction and enamel, the enamel cap altering in different ways the \"transcription\" of the enamel-dentine junction morphology.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Franck Guy","Florent Gouvard","Renaud Boistel","Adela\u00efde Euriat","Vincent Lazzari"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0066142","first_seen_on":"2013-06-24T21:34:35+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"6","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1372109661,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0066142"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0066142.pdf","pmid":"23826088","pubdate":"2013-06-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e66142","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Prospective in (Primate) Dental Analysis through Tooth 3D Topographical Quantification","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prospective-primate-dental-analysis-through-tooth-3d-topographical-quantification"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3072459,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":949908,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89658,"mean":7.4459454141898,"rank":61534,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":17222,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89658,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80037,"mean":8.3320977809987,"rank":56156,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":15615,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80037,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3619,"mean":11.381347153123,"rank":2713,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":593,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3619,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
