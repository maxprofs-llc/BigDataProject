Adjusting the gain can, therefore, target a given level of respiratory effort. This study assessed the clinical feasibility of titrating proportional assist ventilation with load-adjustable gain factors with the goal of targeting a predefined range of respiratory effort.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000263f","doi":"10.1097\/ccm.0b013e31828a42e5","first_seen_on":"2013-06-21T15:48:19+00:00","issns":["0090-3493"],"issue":"","journal":"Critical Care Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1378449821,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/ccmjournal\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Bedside_Adjustment_of_Proportional_Assist.97826.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/ccmjournal\/Abstract\/2013\/09000\/Bedside_Adjustment_of_Proportional_Assist.7.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/ccmjournal\/9000\/00000\/Bedside_Adjustment_of_Proportional_Assist.97826.pdf","pmid":"23787397","pubdate":"2013-06-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"","subjects":["criticalcare"],"title":"Bedside Adjustment of Proportional Assist Ventilation to Target a Predefined Range of Respiratory Effort*","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bedside-adjustment-proportional-assist-ventilation-target-predefined-range-respiratory-effort"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6228985,"mean":5.9651782765876,"rank":2523360,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":3679656,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6228985,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99367,"mean":7.4379695268,"rank":40820,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":57938,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99367,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3850,"mean":7.1061865419589,"rank":2369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":1446,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3850,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118,"mean":7.5977606837607,"rank":80,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
