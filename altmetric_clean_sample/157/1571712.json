The second fraction of the ejaculate was used in this study. The semen was assessed by macroscopic and microscopic criteria 1 min after collection, first dilution, cooling, glycerol addition and thawing. Experiments were conducted to compare the effect of three different concentrations of glycerol in coconut water extender. The freezing method employed was that one described for caprine semen with slight changes. Semen was thawed at 37 degrees C for 1 min. Spermatozoal motility after thawing was 49.2+\/-26, 44.2+\/-18.3 and 35.8+\/-26.8% for groups with 4, 6 and 8% glycerol, respectively. The vigor after thawing was 2.6+\/-1.1, 2.7+\/-1.0 and 2.1+\/-1.2 for these groups, respectively. There was no difference among groups in motility and vigor. However, a smaller percentage of total and secondary abnormalities was observed using 6% glycerol in coconut water extender. In conclusion, the three glycerol concentrations (4, 6 or 8%) can be used successfully in cryopreservation of canine semen using a coconut water extender.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f61000376c","authors":["Cardoso, Rita de C\u00c3\u00a1ssia Soares","Silva, Alexandre Rodrigues","Uchoa, Daniel Couto","da Silva, L\u00c3\u00bacia Daniel Machado"],"first_seen_on":"2013-06-21T04:46:14+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0093-691X"],"issue":"3-4","journal":"Theriogenology","last_mentioned_on":1371747901,"links":["http:\/\/www.journals.elsevierhealth.com\/periodicals\/the\/article\/PIIS0093691X02011512\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.theriojournal.com\/article\/S0093-691X(02)01151-2\/pdf","pmid":"12517378","pubdate":"2003-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Cryopreservation of canine semen using a coconut water extender with egg yolk and three different glycerol concentrations","type":"article","volume":"59","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cryopreservation-canine-semen-using-coconut-water-extender-egg-yolk-three-different-glycerol-concent"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8455699,"mean":7.1054556248262,"rank":4519054,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2355741,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8455699,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126118,"mean":7.0063279494439,"rank":60536,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":50256,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126118,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1065,"mean":2.1340131578947,"rank":389,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":577,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1065,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.3125,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
