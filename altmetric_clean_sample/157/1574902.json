X-ray powder diffraction measurements show that Li(7-3x)Fe(3+)(x)La3Zr2O12 with x = 0.19 crystallizes in the cubic space group Ia-3d, with a0 = 12.986(4) \u00c5 at room temperature. SEM and electron microprobe measurements were made to obtain compositional information and check for the presence of phases other than garnet. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy measurements were made to determine the Li content. (57)Fe M\u00f6ssbauer spectra obtained at 295 and 80 K show that about 96% of the total iron occurs as Fe(3+) and 4% as Fe(2+). Roughly two-thirds of the Fe(3+) cations are assigned to the tetrahedral site (24d) and roughly one-quarter to a highly distorted site (possibly at 96h) in the garnet structure. Smaller amounts of Fe(3+) and Fe(2+), around 5% each, occur at other crystallographic sites. On the basis of published (27)Al MAS NMR results and analysis of the (57)Fe M\u00f6ssbauer spectra, it appears that at low concentrations Al(3+) and Fe(3+) substitute in Li7La3Zr2O12 in a similar manner. The aliovalent substitution Al(3+)\/Fe(3+) \u2194 3Li(+) in LLZO stabilizes the cubic phase and also probably promotes its high Li-ion conductivity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Daniel Rettenwander","Charles A.
