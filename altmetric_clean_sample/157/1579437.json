The combination of the 2,9-sec-butyl substituents with the neighboring 3,8-methyl groups led to a Cu(I) complex with small degrees of ground and excited state distortion ultimately producing a molecule with robust metal-to-ligand charge transfer photophysics largely insulated from solvent interactions, reversible redox chemistry serving as a strong excited state reductant, along with impressive thermodynamic and photochemical stability in solution.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Catherine E.
