It is a key feature of many psychopathologies such as mania, addictive disorders or attention deficit-hyperactivity disorders. To date, the aspects of impulsiveness involved in these pathologies have not yet been explicitly defined. In these disorders, sensation or drug seeking and cognitive deficits are closely related, but the nature of these relationships remains largely unknown. A new animal model of impulsiveness based on spontaneous inter-individual differences is proposed here to help clarify the relationship between characteristic aspects of impulsive-related pathologies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007de","doi":"10.1186\/1744-9081-2-10","first_seen_on":"2013-06-21T06:38:57+00:00","issns":["1744-9081"],"issue":"1","journal":"Behavioral and Brain Functions","last_mentioned_on":1370865315,"links":["http:\/\/www.behavioralandbrainfunctions.com\/content\/2\/1\/10"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.behavioralandbrainfunctions.com\/content\/pdf\/1744-9081-2-10.pdf","pmid":"16569223","pubdate":"2006-03-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Behavioral Therapy","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"10","subjects":["brain","behavioralsciences"],"title":"Relationship between impulsivity, hyperactivity and working memory: a differential analysis in the rat","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/relationship-between-impulsivity-hyperactivity-working-memory-differential-analysis-rat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629728,"mean":4.9326084606411,"rank":2900375,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":78574,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629728,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85229,"mean":7.132127282114,"rank":67769,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":301,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85229,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253,"mean":3.1921666666667,"rank":174,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":3.5642857142857,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Researcher":20,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
