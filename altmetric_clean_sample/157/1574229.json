Researchers have studied surrogate, neuroanatomic biomarkers provided by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that may help in the early diagnosis of this condition. In this article, four classification models (na\u00efve Bayes, multivariate filter-based na\u00efve Bayes, filter selective na\u00efve Bayes and support vector machines, SVM) have been applied to evaluate their capacity to discriminate between cognitively intact patients with Parkinson's disease (PDCI), PDMCI and PDD. For this purpose, the MRI studies of 45 subjects (16 PDCI, 15 PDMCI and 14 PDD) were acquired and post-processed with Freesurfer, obtaining 112 variables (volumes of subcortical structures and thickness of cortical parcels) per subject. A multivariate filter-based na\u00efve Bayes model was found to be the best classifier, having the highest cross-validated sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Additionally, the most relevant variables related to dementia in PD, as predicted by our classifiers, were cerebral white matter, and volumes of the lateral ventricles and hippocampi.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033d2","authors":["Morales DA","Vives-Gilabert Y","G\u00f3mez-Ans\u00f3n B","Bengoetxea E","Larra\u00f1aga P","Bielza C","Pagonabarraga J","Kulisevsky J","Corcuera-Solano I","Delfino M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pscychresns.2012.06.001","first_seen_on":"2013-06-21T14:06:56+00:00","issns":["0165-1781","09254927"],"journal":"Psychiatry Research","last_mentioned_on":1371756711,"links":["http:\/\/rss.sciencedirect.com\/action\/redirectFile?&zone=main&currentActivity=feed&usageType=outward&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0925492712001254%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D8a4a3c7df36a4bcb035e471e5ddd399e"],"pmid":"23149030","pubdate":"2012-11-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Predicting dementia development in Parkinson's disease using Bayesian network classifiers ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/predicting-dementia-development-parkinsons-disease-using-bayesian-network-classifiers-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627006,"mean":4.9509722374284,"rank":2907020,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":73368,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627006,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85111,"mean":7.16479906004,"rank":67894,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85111,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1994,"mean":3.0631841445058,"rank":1720,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1994,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98,"mean":3.6728659793814,"rank":87,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"http:\/\/rss.sciencedirect.com\/action\/redirectFile?&zone=main&currentActivity=feed&usageType=outward&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0925492712001254%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D8a4a3c7df36a4bcb035e471e5ddd399e","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=490124144391308&id=450103581726698","license":"public","citation_ids":[1574229],"posted_on":"2013-06-20T19:31:51+00:00","summary":"ScienceDirect Publication: Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging\nPredicting dementia development in Parkinson's disease using Bayesian network classifiers              Publication date: Source:Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging, Volume 213, Issue 2     Author(s","author":{"name":"Psychiatry - Updates by Dr Thiha Swe","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/450103581726698","facebook_wall_name":"Psychiatry - Updates by Dr Thiha Swe","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/450103581726698\/picture","id_on_source":"450103581726698"}}]}}
