The covalent linkage of Phe-Phe and NSAIDs results in conjugates that self-assemble in water to form molecular nanofibers as the matrices of hydrogels. When the NSAID is naproxen (1), the resultant hydrogelator 1a forms a hydrogel at a critical concentration (cgc) of 0.2 wt % at pH 7.0. Hydrogelator 1a, also acting as a general motif, enables enzymatic hydrogelation in which the precursor turns into a hydrogelator upon hydrolysis catalyzed by a phosphatase at physiological conditions. The conjugates of Phe-Phe with other NSAIDs, such as (R)-flurbiprofen (2), racemic flurbiprofen (3), and racemic ibuprofen (4), are able to form molecular hydrogels, except in the case of aspirin (5). After the conjugation with the small peptides, NSAIDs exhibit improved selectivity to their targets. In addition, the peptides made of D-amino acids help preserve the activities of NSAIDs. Besides demonstrating that common NSAIDs are excellent candidates to promote aromatic-aromatic interaction in water to form hydrogels, this work contributes to the development of functional molecules that have dual or multiple roles and ultimately may lead to new molecular hydrogels of therapeutic agents for topical use.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007df","authors":["Li J","Kuang Y","Shi J","Gao Y","Zhou J","Xu B"],"doi":"10.3762\/bjoc.9.104","endpage":"917","first_seen_on":"2013-06-24T17:01:22+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["","1860-5397"],"issue":"","journal":"Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1372093242,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23766806"],"pmid":"23766806","pubdate":"2013-06-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"908","title":"The conjugation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) to small peptides for generating multifunctional supramolecular nanofibers\/hydrogels.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/conjugation-nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaid-small-peptides-generating-multifunctional-supr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3072455,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":949911,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89658,"mean":7.4459164147809,"rank":61532,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":17222,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89658,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":152,"mean":2.2418278145695,"rank":97,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":152,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.8893333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
