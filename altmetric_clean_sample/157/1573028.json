We have previously shown that vaspin has anti-inflammatory and antimigratory effects in vascular smooth muscle cells. Methylglyoxal (MGO) is an active metabolite of glucose and mediates diabetic vascular complications including endothelial cell (EC) apoptosis. Nonetheless, effects of vaspin on MGO-induced apoptosis of vascular EC remain to be determined. We investigated the effects of vaspin on MGO-induced apoptosis of human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002161","authors":["Phalitakul, S.","Okada, M.","Hara, Y.","Yamawaki, H."],"doi":"10.1111\/apha.12139","endpage":"219","first_seen_on":"2013-06-21T07:31:23+00:00","issns":["1748-1716","1748-1708"],"issue":"3","journal":"Acta Physiologica","last_mentioned_on":1371732248,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/apha.12139\/abstract;jsessionid=592C81B95C794F1E994DC827FEF55039.d03t02"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/apha.12139\/pdf","pmid":"23782902","pubdate":"2013-07-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"212","subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Vaspin prevents methylglyoxal\u00e2\u0080\u0090induced apoptosis in human vascular endothelial cells by inhibiting reactive oxygen species generation","type":"article","volume":"209","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vaspin-prevents-methylglyoxalinduced-apoptosis-human-vascular-endothelial-cells-inhibiting-reactive-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6289149,"mean":5.9799639738173,"rank":4649280,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":940973,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6289149,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99882,"mean":7.4245280684014,"rank":67710,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":17038,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99882,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":483,"mean":4.0347883817427,"rank":308,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":86,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":483,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.98125,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/WBAnatomyPhysio\/statuses\/347696367914868736","license":"public","citation_ids":[1573028],"posted_on":"2013-06-20T12:44:08+00:00","author":{"name":"WBAnatomyPhysiology","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2936079549\/493e867eddb0b92595478c9c163361f7_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"WBAnatomyPhysio","tweeter_id":"155932827","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":745},"tweet_id":"347696367914868736"}]}}
