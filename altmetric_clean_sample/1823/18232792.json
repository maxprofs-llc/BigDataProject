However, alterations differ between progressive supranuclear palsy with Richardson syndrome and progressive supranuclear palsy-parkinsonism. In this study, we propose an automated tool for superior cerebellar peduncle integrity assessment and test its performance in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy with Richardson syndrome, progressive supranuclear palsy-parkinsonism, Parkinson disease, and healthy controls.\nStructural and diffusion MRI was performed in 21 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy with Richardson syndrome, 9 with progressive supranuclear palsy-parkinsonism, 20 with Parkinson disease, and 30 healthy subjects. In a fully automated pipeline, the left and right superior cerebellar peduncles were first identified on MR imaging by using a tractography-based atlas of white matter tracts; subsequently, volume, mean diffusivity, and fractional anisotropy were extracted from superior cerebellar peduncles. These measures were compared across groups, and their discriminative power in differentiating patients was evaluated in a linear discriminant analysis.\nCompared with those with Parkinson disease and controls, patients with progressive supranuclear palsy with Richardson syndrome showed alterations of all superior cerebellar peduncle metrics (decreased volume and fractional anisotropy, increased mean diffusivity). Patients with progressive supranuclear palsy-parkinsonism had smaller volumes than those with Parkinson disease and controls and lower fractional anisotropy than those with Parkinson disease. Patients with progressive supranuclear palsy with Richardson syndrome had significantly altered fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity in the left superior cerebellar peduncle compared with those with progressive supranuclear palsy-parkinsonism. Discriminant analysis with the sole use of significant variables separated progressive supranuclear palsy-parkinsonism from progressive supranuclear palsy with Richardson syndrome with 70% accuracy and progressive supranuclear palsy-parkinsonism from Parkinson disease with 74% accuracy.\nWe demonstrate the feasibility of an automated approach for extracting multimodal MR imaging metrics from the superior cerebellar peduncle in healthy subjects and patients with parkinsonian. We provide evidence that structural and diffusion measures of the superior cerebellar peduncle might be valuable for computer-aided diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy subtypes and for differentiating patients with progressive supranuclear palsy-parkinsonism from with those with Parkinson disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f610006984","authors":["G.
