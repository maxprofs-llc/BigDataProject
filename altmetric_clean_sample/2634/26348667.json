Overall, 40 primer pairs were designed and tested; 19 of them amplified successfully and demonstrated polymorphisms. Two loci that detected null alleles were eliminated, and the remaining 17, which were subjected to further analyses, yielded two to 21 alleles per locus.\nThe markers will serve as a basis for studies to assess the extent and pattern of distribution of genetic variation in T. nigrans, and they may also be useful in conservation genetic, ecological, and evolutionary studies of the genus Taxillus, a group of plant species of importance in Chinese traditional medicine.","altmetric_jid":"554b867b2a83ee864e8b45a0","authors":["Ning Miao","Lei Zhang","Maoping Li","Liqiang Fan","Kangshan Mao"],"doi":"10.3732\/apps.1700010","first_seen_on":"2017-09-20T10:08:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2168-0450"],"issue":"8","journal":"Applications in Plant Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1505923249,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28924510?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28924510"],"pmcid":"PMC5584814","pmid":"28924510","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Development of EST-SSR Markers for Taxillus nigrans (Loranthaceae) in Southwestern China Using Next-Generation Sequencing","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-estssr-markers-itaxillus-nigransi-loranthaceae-southwestern-china-using-nextgeneration-s"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0.5,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8440508,"mean":7.0976499018281,"rank":6404328,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1147336,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8440508,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113949,"mean":11.844046178959,"rank":80389,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":20814,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113949,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":216,"mean":13.229693023256,"rank":136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":216,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CompBiolPapers\/statuses\/910445569738383362","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26348667],"posted_on":"2017-09-20T10:08:33+00:00","author":{"name":"CompBiolPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/848199297611026432\/GiXZ3YhG_normal.jpg","description":"Feed for sequencing papers","id_on_source":"CompBiolPapers","tweeter_id":"2365948482","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":724},"tweet_id":"910445569738383362"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/transcriptomes\/statuses\/910534217922002944","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26348667],"posted_on":"2017-09-20T16:00:49+00:00","author":{"name":"Transcriptomes","url":"http:\/\/davetang.org\/muse\/2015\/01\/31\/transcriptome-feed-using-r\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/561190761790574593\/2j6U4lnz_normal.png","description":"A transcriptome feed made using #Rstats.
