Structured illumination techniques will give users a set of tools that are close to their past experience and relatively simple and quick to learn. The present dyes can be used. Resolution approaching 100\u00a0nm XY can be achieved. In contrast, stochastic methods such as PALM\/STORM typically require the choice of new dyes and a much greater learning curve to master the technology and calculations. However, a further fivefold resolution improvement is possible. Stimulated depletion techniques such as STED offer a third set of approaches that will again require the use of new dyes. All these approaches require substantial investment in new equipment and in user training. There is no free lunch in the search for better resolution.","aggregated_in":[26513659],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd3b","authors":["Jeffrey A.
