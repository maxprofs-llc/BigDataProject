The present cognitive rehabilitation included a set of physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy for 1-2\u2009h once or twice a week. We compared the Mini-Mental State Examination and Frontal Assessment Battery for cognitive assessment, and Geriatric Depression Scale, Apathy Scale, and Abe's Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia score for affective assessment in two groups over 6\u2009months.\nThe baseline Mini-Mental State Examination score was 20.2 and 18.7 in groups\u2009G and G\u2009+\u2009R, respectively. Other baseline data (Frontal Assessment Battery, Geriatric Depression Scale, Apathy Scale, and Abe's Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia) were not different between the two groups. Although group\u2009G kept all the scores stable until 6\u2009months of the treatment, the Apathy Scale score showed a significant improvement in group\u2009G\u2009+\u2009R as early as 3\u2009months, followed by the Mini-Mental State Examination and Frontal Assessment Battery improvements at 6\u2009months (*P\u2009=\u20090.04 and *P\u2009=\u20090.02, respectively). The Geriatric Depression Scale and Abe's Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia did not show any changes.\nThe combination therapy of galantamine plus ambulatory cognitive rehabilitation showed a superior benefit both on cognitive and affective functions than galantamine only therapy in Alzheimer's disease patients.
