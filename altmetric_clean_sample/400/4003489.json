Patients with one or more predictors of difficult intubation scheduled for general anaesthesia were assessed for eligibility. Patients were intubated using Boedeker intubation forceps and MVL. The primary endpoint was time to intubation. The secondary endpoints were intubation success rate, number of intubation attempts, intubation conditions and post-operative hoarseness.\nThirty-three patients were assessed for eligibility, and 25 patients were included in the study with a median SARI score of 3 (IQR 3-4). Twenty-two (88%, 95% confidence interval [74-100%]) of the patients were successfully intubated by the method with a median time to intubation of 115\u00a0s (IQR 78-247). Steering and advancement of the tube were reported as acceptable in 21 (84%) and 22 cases (88%), respectively, and excellent in 10 cases (45%) for both measures. Ten cases (40%) were intubated on the first attempt. There were three cases (12%) of failed intubation; in these cases, successful intubation was obtained by using a styletted tube.\nMost patients with anticipated difficult intubation can be successfully intubated with Boedeker intubation forceps and MVL. However, endotracheal tube placement failed in 3\/25 patients despite a good laryngeal view.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002143","authors":["Str\u00f8m, C.","Barnung, S.","Kristensen, M.
