These episodes are interspersed with long periods of normal sleep, cognition, and behavior. The pathogenesis of KLS is still unknown. The objective of this study was to determine serum cytokine levels in patients with KLS during and between episodes.\nFifty-two typical KLS patients were included in the study of whom 17 patients donated blood samples both during and between episodes. Blood samples were collected in USA, France, and Taiwan in a clinical setting. Processing of the samples was performed at the Stanford Center for Sleep Sciences and Medicine.\nWe did not observe any changes in serum cytokine levels during KLS episodes compared to between episodes. In a small cohort of asymptomatic KLS patients and age- and gender matched healthy controls (n\u2009=\u20098\/group) whose blood samples were all collected and processed at the same day; asymptomatic KLS patients had significantly higher levels of serum sVCAM1 cytokine compared to healthy controls.\nThese data suggest that KLS episodes are not accompanied by an abnormal systemic immune reaction.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f610003550","authors":["Kornum, Birgitte Rahbek","Rico, Thomas","Lin, Ling","Huang, Yu-Shu","Arnulf, Isabelle","Jennum, Poul","Mignot, Emmanuel"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.sleep.2015.02.540","first_seen_on":"2015-05-16T00:35:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1389-9457","1878-5506","13899457"],"issue":"8","journal":"Sleep Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1461408976,"links":["http:\/\/www.sleep-journal.com\/article\/S1389-9457(15)00732-7\/abstract?rss=yes","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26116465?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26116465","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26116465?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.sleep-journal.com\/article\/S1389945715007327\/pdf","pmid":"26116465","pubdate":"2015-06-28T13:04:21+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"Serum cytokine levels in Kleine-Levin syndrome.","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/serum-cytokine-levels-kleinelevin-syndrome-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7591700,"mean":6.5431604635494,"rank":3167432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4314541,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7591700,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208334,"mean":8.5755209688337,"rank":82470,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":121611,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208334,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1678,"mean":5.5837805605247,"rank":614,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":1024,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1678,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77,"mean":3.4288157894737,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
