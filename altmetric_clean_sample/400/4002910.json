Patients were included from a longitudinal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging study of minor stroke\/transient ischemic attack patients. Images were co-registered and new WMH at 18 months were identified by comparing follow-up imaging with baseline fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR). Regions-of-interest (ROIs) were placed on FLAIR images in one of three categories: (1) WMH seen at both baseline and follow-up imaging, (2) new WMH seen only on follow-up imaging, and (3) regions of normal-appearing white matter at both time points. Registered CBF maps at baseline were used to measure CBF in the ROIs. A multivariable model was developed using mixed-effects logistic regression to determine the effect of baseline CBF on the development on new WMH. Forty patients were included. Mean age was 61\u00b111 years, 30% were female. Low baseline CBF, female sex, and presence of diabetes were independently associated with the presence of new WMH on follow-up imaging. The odds of having new WMH on follow-up imaging reduces by 0.61 (95% confidence interval=0.57 to 0.65) for each 1\u2009mL\/100\u2009g per minute increase in baseline CBF. We conclude that regions of white matter with low CBF develop new WMH on follow-up imaging.Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism advance online publication, 13 May 2015; doi:10.1038\/jcbfm.2015.92.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002ce7","authors":["Manya Bernbaum","Manya Bernbaum","Bijoy K Menon","Gordon Fick","Eric E Smith","Mayank Goyal","Richard Frayne","Shelagh B Coutts"],"doi":"10.1038\/jcbfm.2015.92","first_seen_on":"2015-05-16T22:11:41+00:00","funders":["niehs","cihr"],"issns":["1559-7016"],"journal":"Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1431564722,"links":["http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/jcbfm\/rss\/aop\/~3\/Gpkq16pgZPA\/jcbfm.2015.92"],"pmid":"25966951","pubdate":"2015-05-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["metabolism","brain"],"title":"Reduced blood flow in normal white matter predicts development of leukoaraiosis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reduced-blood-flow-normal-white-matter-predicts-development-leukoaraiosis-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5098139,"mean":6.0408647239452,"rank":719064,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":4339332,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5098139,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163749,"mean":9.2229259349733,"rank":33241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":129045,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163749,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1016,"mean":4.904957635468,"rank":221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":669,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1016,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94,"mean":10.336559139785,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
