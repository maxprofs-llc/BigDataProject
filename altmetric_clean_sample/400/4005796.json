Because TC intensification is significantly controlled by atmosphere and ocean environments, changes in these environments may cause changes in TC intensity. Changes in surface and subsurface ocean conditions can both influence a TC's intensification. Regarding global warming, minimal exploration of the subsurface ocean has been undertaken. Here we investigate future subsurface ocean environment changes projected by 22 state-of-the-art climate models and suggest a suppressive effect of subsurface oceans on the intensification of future TCs. Under global warming, the subsurface vertical temperature profile can be sharpened in important TC regions, which may contribute to a stronger ocean coupling (cooling) effect during the intensification of future TCs. Regarding a TC, future subsurface ocean environments may be more suppressive than the existing subsurface ocean environments. This suppressive effect is not spatially uniform and may be weak in certain local areas.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Ping Huang","Ping Huang","I. -I Lin","Chia Chou","Rong-Hui Huang"],"doi":"10.1038\/ncomms8188","first_seen_on":"2015-05-18T10:52:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","last_mentioned_on":1432760565,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ncomms\/2015\/150518\/ncomms8188\/full\/ncomms8188.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/ncomms8188","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25982028?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ncomms\/2015\/150518\/ncomms8188\/full\/ncomms8188.html?WT.ec_id=NCOMMS-20150520"],"pmid":"25982028","pubdate":"2015-05-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["science","biology"],"title":"Change in ocean subsurface environment to suppress tropical cyclone intensification under global warming","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/change-ocean-subsurface-environment-suppress-tropical-cyclone-intensification-under-global-warming"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8006000,"mean":6.7576915960097,"rank":1280652,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":6657615,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8006000,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":216890,"mean":8.601399075103,"rank":45813,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":170770,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":216890,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12462,"mean":43.596530776021,"rank":7348,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":5098,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12462,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":702,"mean":31.810390870185,"rank":381,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":320,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":702,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"researcher":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":9,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
