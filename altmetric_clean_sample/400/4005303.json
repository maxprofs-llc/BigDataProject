Self-stimulation revealed an increase in the bar touch rate when using higher electrical currents, with no ceiling effects observed. During a training session the touch rate decreased, often before the monkeys had received 1000 deliveries of BSR, suggesting satiation.\nWhen BSR is applied directly to the VTA\/SN, it can motivate monkeys to perform detection tasks, exhibit operant actions, and may be used as a substitute for fluid or food rewards. Monkeys ceased self-stimulation during a training session by their own volition, in contrast to work on rodents. This may be an important safety aspect for consideration in the development of electrical stimulation procedures for patients with dysfunctions of the dopaminergic system; thus, satiation may avert additional compulsions to already existing compulsive behaviors in patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60f3cf058f610006ce7","authors":["Lovell, Jonathan Murray","Mylius, Judith","Scheich, Henning","Brosch, Michael"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.brs.2015.04.007","first_seen_on":"2015-05-18T07:35:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1935-861X"],"journal":"Brain Stimulation","last_mentioned_on":1431934475,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1935861X15009316"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.brainstimjrnl.com\/article\/S1935861X15009316\/pdf","pmid":"26070295","pubdate":"2015-06-14T22:02:24+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["brain"],"title":"Stimulation of the dopaminergic midbrain as a behavioural reward in instrumentally conditioned monkeys","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/stimulation-dopaminergic-midbrain-behavioral-reward-instrumentally-conditioned-monkeys"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5114553,"mean":6.0542482457907,"rank":4254213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5114553,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170004,"mean":9.0913937165816,"rank":140521,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170004,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":446,"mean":5.0855011235955,"rank":387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":446,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":6.8884444444444,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
