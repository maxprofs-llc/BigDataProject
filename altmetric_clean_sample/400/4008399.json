However, challenges in daily life may remain. We sought to measure changes following the progression of CMA using the Food hypersensitivity famiLy ImPact questionnaire (FLIP).\nFamilies of children with CMA, who participated in the validation of the FLIP, were re-approached six-months later for follow-up. Change in experienced difficulties was assessed by paired sample t-test and mixed models, stratifying the analysis by progression of CMA, i.e. outgrown versus persistent CMA.\nImpact on families with children who had outgrown CMA (n= 20) decreased in the FLIP's total score (p= 0.0001) and in two subscales; Health and Emotions (p= 0.0001) and Everyday Life (p= 0.0001). No significant improvements were registered in nutritional concerns. Impact on the group with persistent CMA (n= 57) was unchanged at follow-up except for more impact on everyday life issues (p= 0.001). In the final analysis comparing longitudinal changes in the groups with outgrown versus persistent CMA, the strongest differences were observed for the subscales Health & Emotions and Everyday Life; for the Nutrition subscale the between-group changes also differed, but to lesser extent.\nWe can confirm that challenges changes over time following the CMA's progression. Families still affected experienced sustained impact in daily life. Despite development of tolerance, no longer affected families revealed sustained nutritional concerns. Follow-ups should be offered even after outgrown CMA to encourage progression to unrestricted diet, prevent eating disorders and impaired growth. This article is protected by copyright.
