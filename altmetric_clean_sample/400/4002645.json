The structures of 1-10 were elucidated by analysis of their 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic data; the absolute configuration of their polycyclic skeleton was determined by the electronic circular dichroism exciton chirality method and was subsequently confirmed by an X-ray diffraction study of 1. The evaluation of their inhibitory effects on nitric oxide (NO) production in lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW264.7 cells revealed that compound 7 exhibited significant NO inhibition activity, with an IC50 value of 9.5 \u03bcM.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d8b","authors":["Wen-Jun Xu"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jnatprod.5b00066","first_seen_on":"2015-05-16T19:16:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-6025"],"journal":"Journal of Natural Products","last_mentioned_on":1431803740,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jnatprod.5b00066"],"pmid":"25924023","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Hypermongones A\u2013J, Rare Methylated Polycyclic Polyprenylated Acylphloroglucinols from the Flowers of Hypericum monogynum","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hypermongones-aj-rare-methylated-polycyclic-polyprenylated-acylphloroglucinols-flowers-hypericum-mon"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5104590,"mean":6.0450885996918,"rank":2341551,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2634463,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5104590,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163854,"mean":9.2230189010883,"rank":78535,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":79675,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163854,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1275,"mean":3.2898618524333,"rank":718,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":507,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1275,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":4.0932173913043,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
