The resonance peak of the metamaterial can be redshifted and blueshifted as the frequency of an external voltage is switched, and the response times for the redshift and blueshift are 1.044 and 1.376\u00a0ms, respectively. A simulation confirms the spectral redshift and blueshift. The variation in peak frequency as a function of applied frequency at the external voltage is presented. Experimental results show that the resonance peak of the metamaterial can be continuously tuned within a frequency range of 15\u00a0GHz as the applied frequency is switched between 19 and 22\u00a0kHz. Therefore, this metamaterial is a continuously tunable and fast-response THz filter and could be used for THz imaging and THz telecommunications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5773cf058f610004d26","authors":["Chen, Chia-Chun","Chiang, Wei-Fan","Tsai, Min-Cheng","Jiang, Shun-An","Chang, Tsung-Hao","Wang, Song-Hang","Huang, Chia-Yi"],"first_seen_on":"2015-05-18T00:08:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1539-4794"],"issue":"9","journal":"Optics Letters","last_mentioned_on":1431879660,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25927774"],"pmid":"25927774","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Optical Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Quantum Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Continuously tunable and fast-response terahertz metamaterials using in-plane-switching dual-frequency liquid crystal cells.","type":"article","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/continuously-tunable-fastresponse-terahertz-metamaterials-using-inplaneswitching-dualfrequency-liqui"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5110354,"mean":6.048187121714,"rank":2698206,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1744631,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5110354,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169956,"mean":9.0892842340621,"rank":96980,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":56245,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169956,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":894,"mean":4.7340268756999,"rank":441,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":295,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":894,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":2.75,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
