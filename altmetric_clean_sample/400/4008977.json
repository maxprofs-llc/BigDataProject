PubMed and the Cochrane Library were searched to identify papers performing comparative analysis of costs and effects of treatment for secondary hyperparathyroidism in adult patients. Among the 66 papers identified, only 10 were included in the analysis. Treatment strategies evaluated in the selected papers were: cinacalcet in addition to vitamin D and phosphate binders versus vitamin D and phosphate binders only (seven papers), paricalcitol versus non-selective vitamin D (two papers), early and late introduction of cinacalcet in addition to vitamin D and phosphate binders (one paper) and paricalcitol versus cinacalcet (one paper). The high degree of heterogeneity among alternative treatments and methodological limits related to cost items considered, resource valuation methods and so on, make it unfeasible to reach a definite conclusion regarding cost-effectiveness but allow for future research opportunities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073d8","authors":["Valentina Lorenzoni","Leopoldo Trieste","Giuseppe Turchetti"],"doi":"10.1586\/14737167.2015.1047348","endpage":"14","first_seen_on":"2015-05-19T04:08:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1473-7167","1744-8379"],"journal":"Expert Review of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research","last_mentioned_on":1432155612,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1586\/14737167.2015.1047348?ai=9b1l&mi=6zgfdo&af=R&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&","http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1586\/14737167.2015.1047348?ai=9b1l&mi=70tvry&af=R&","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25988877"],"pmid":"25988877","pubdate":"2015-05-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Applied Economics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"The cost-effectiveness of drug therapies to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in renal failure: a focus on evidence regarding paricalcitol and cinacalcet.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/costeffectiveness-drug-therapies-treat-secondary-hyperparathyroidism-renal-failure-focus-evidence-re"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5124740,"mean":6.0645075040905,"rank":2528640,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2442484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5124740,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171138,"mean":9.0628247544366,"rank":89288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":74513,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171138,"percentile":43},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":370,"mean":1.6534308943089,"rank":114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":241,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":370,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.90625,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CEStezhka\/status\/600513105039228928","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4008977],"posted_on":"2015-05-19T04:07:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Tanya - ERP&OR","url":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/ierp","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/585788897323520000\/MwmgjKlF_normal.png","description":"Managing Editor, Expert Reviews, Journal of Medical Economics.
