The results obtained with the M06-L, M06-2X, TPPS-D3, TPSS-D3BJ, B3LYP-D3 and B3LYP-D3BJ methods supported a significant reduction of the inversion barriers. In the case of corannulene adsorbed onto graphene, non bonded interactions reduce the inversion barrier by at least a 50% with respect to the gas phase, while for adsorbed sumanene and dibenzo[a,g]corannulene the reductions are at least 39 and 67%, respectively. When the molecules are intercalated in bilayer graphene the lowering of the activation energy is more significant. In the particular case of dibenzo[a,g]corannulene the molecule is expected to display an almost planar structure, with its 0.83\u00c5 bowl depth almost completely quenched. For intercalated corannulene and sumanene, the inversion barriers are at least 66 and 60% lower, respectively. It is our hope that these results can help to improve the design of receptors which can catalyze the inversion of buckybowls.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec4","authors":["Pablo A.
