No women had signs of iron overload; however, nine men (5%) had persistenly elevated serum iron levels. In four men (2%), increased iron stores was found with a distribution like that in the early stages of hemochromatosis. In combination with recent findings of clinical hemochromatosis at our hospital, this study suggests that this condition is not as rare as has been reported earlier.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c38","authors":["Olsson, K S","Heedman, P A","Staug\u00e1rd, F"],"first_seen_on":"2015-05-18T20:11:54+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["0098-7484"],"issue":"19","journal":"JAMA: Journal of the American Medical Association","last_mentioned_on":1431344401,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/642130"],"pmid":"642130","pubdate":"1978-05-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Preclinical hemochromatosis in a population on a high-iron-fortified diet.","type":"article","volume":"239","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/preclinical-hemochromatosis-population-highironfortified-diet"},"altmetric_score":{"score":15,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":15},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5085441,"mean":6.0243406619703,"rank":320335,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":4762043,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5085441,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169465,"mean":9.0870299296607,"rank":17338,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":152033,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169465,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12545,"mean":31.511586575255,"rank":3974,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":8548,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12545,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":420,"mean":68.379484486873,"rank":273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":147,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":420,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Why excess iron can be dangerous","url":"http:\/\/medicalxpress.com\/news\/2015-05-excess-iron-dangerous.html","license":"public","citation_ids":[4007334,4007335,532219,4007336,4007337,248458,4007338,4007339,4007340,3277697,4007342],"posted_on":"2015-05-11T11:40:01+00:00","summary":"Iron is a most versatile element.
