Pharmacologic agents that were previously studied were found to be ineffective likely due to a combination of their targets and flaws in trial design. Potential future pharmacologic agents, particularly those that target intracellular calcium signaling, as well as considerations for trial design will be discussed. As the incidence of acute pancreatitis continues to increase, greater efforts will be needed to prevent hospitalization, readmission and excessive imaging in order to reduce overall healthcare costs. Primary prevention continues to focus on post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis and secondary prevention on cholecystectomy for biliary pancreatitis as well as alcohol and smoking abstinence.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073d1","authors":["Vikesh K Singh","Robert A Moran","Elham Afghani","Enrique de-Madaria"],"doi":"10.1586\/17474124.2015.1048225","endpage":"11","first_seen_on":"2015-05-19T03:26:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1747-4124","1747-4132"],"journal":"Expert Review of Gastroenterology and Hepatology","last_mentioned_on":1432131974,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1586\/17474124.2015.1048225?ai=9b1e&mi=4ca1o4&af=R&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&","http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1586\/17474124.2015.1048225"],"pmid":"25982517","pubdate":"2015-05-17T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Treating acute pancreatitis \u2013 what\u2019s new?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/treating-acute-pancreatitis-whats-new-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5462004,"mean":6.3513590516133,"rank":2902378,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1857070,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5462004,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177592,"mean":9.1096875742578,"rank":101230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":59176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177592,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":358,"mean":1.4952492997199,"rank":113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":358,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.0535714285714,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ERJournals\/status\/600502511926018049","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4008863],"posted_on":"2015-05-19T03:25:30+00:00","author":{"name":"Expert Reviews","url":"http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/page\/ExpertReviews","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000496751182\/2258702d67dd42cedd317fb79fc5212a_normal.jpeg","description":"Expert Reviews is a leading series of 16 journals providing commentary and analysis on modern healthcare","id_on_source":"ERJournals","tweeter_id":"1886949961","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1279},"tweet_id":"600502511926018049"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DeMadaria\/status\/601030440892366848","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4008863],"posted_on":"2015-05-20T14:23:18+00:00","author":{"name":"Enrique de-Madaria","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/694604593074946052\/4B6ZVVaF_normal.jpg","description":"Gastroenter\u00f3logo, pancreat\u00f3logo.
