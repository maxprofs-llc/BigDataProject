The objective of this study was to determine the effects of level of inclusion of wDDGS with or without enzyme (E-, i.e., wDDGSE-) supplementation on performance and water consumption of turkey hens (0 to 72 d). Two diets (0 or 30% wDDGS) were formulated to meet the nutrient requirements of Hybrid Converter turkeys. Diets (0 or 30% wDDGS; starter, grower, and finisher) were then blended to obtain a different level of inclusion (15%) of wDDGS. The 30% wDDGS diet was divided into 3 fractions and 2 fractions supplemented with either protease (P+, i.e., wDDGSP+; 0.126\u2009g\/kg) or \u03b2-mannanase (M+, i.e., wDDGSM+; 0.05\u2009g\/kg). All 5 diets were fed ad libitum as mash. The 700 0-d turkey hens were randomly allocated into groups of 35 birds per replicate with 4 replicate floor pens per treatment, in a completely randomized design. Water consumption per pen was recorded beginning at 7 d. There was no effect of dietary treatment on feed intake. BW of turkey hens (52\u2009d; grower) was significantly higher for 30% wDDGSP+ as compared to 0% wDDGSE- or 15% wDDGSE- diets; but was not different from 30% wDDGSE- or 30% wDDGSM+ diets. FCR (P < 0.01; 28 to 52 d), and total FCR (P < 0.05; 0 to 72 d) was significantly improved for birds fed 15 or 30% wDDGS regardless of enzyme treatment compared to 0% wDDGSE-. Water intake (WI, in mL per bird per day) tended to be higher (P = 0.08) between 7 and 28\u2009d for 30% wDDGSP+ diets compared to other treatments. Similarly, WI of birds fed 30% wDDGSP+ was higher (P < 0.05; 28 to 52 and 52 to 72 d) and total WI (P = 0.07; 7 to 72 d) tended to be higher than other treatments. This study is the first to report the impact of wDDGS on WI. As high as 30% wDDGS can be substituted in turkey hen diets. No effect of P+ or M+ at the inclusion level tested was found on performance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003375","authors":["Opoku, E Y","Classen, H L","Scott, T A"],"doi":"10.3382\/ps\/pev088","first_seen_on":"2015-05-19T10:16:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0032-5791"],"journal":"Poultry Science","last_mentioned_on":1442419864,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25971948?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25971948?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25971948","pubdate":"2015-05-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Evaluation of inclusion level of wheat distillers dried grains with solubles with and without protease or \u03b2-mannanase on performance and water intake of turkey hens.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-inclusion-level-wheat-distillers-dried-grains-solubles-without-protease-%CE%B2mannanase-perfor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6353695,"mean":5.8390076758497,"rank":4694267,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":941281,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6353695,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180595,"mean":9.0929907638128,"rank":129204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":31563,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180595,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":824,"mean":2.8338080194411,"rank":528,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":824,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":1.1931034482759,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/__birdRS__\/status\/600605675669053440","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4009816],"posted_on":"2015-05-19T10:15:26+00:00","author":{"name":"birdRS - Matt Bishop","url":"http:\/\/www.birdrs.net","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/575298626483720192\/uUW7Ltds_normal.png","description":"Ornithology and birding related science links for the benefit of 'citizen science' and avian research groups.
