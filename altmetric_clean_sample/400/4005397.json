Although human genomic studies have demonstrated associations between diabetes and the INS\/IGF2 locus or the IGF2 mRNA binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2), the role of IGF2 in diabetes pathogenesis is not fully understood. We previously described that transgenic mice overexpressing IGF2 specifically in \u03b2-cells (Tg-IGF2) develop a pre-diabetic state. Here, we characterized the effects of IGF2 on \u03b2-cell functionality. Overexpression of IGF2 led to \u03b2-cell dedifferentiation and endoplasmic reticulum stress causing islet dysfunction in vivo. Both adenoviral-mediated overexpression of IGF2 and treatment of adult wild-type islets with recombinant IGF2 in vitro further confirmed the direct implication of IGF2 on \u03b2-cell dysfunction. Treatment of Tg-IGF2 mice with subdiabetogenic doses of streptozotocin or crossing these mice with a transgenic model of islet lymphocytic infiltration promoted the development of overt diabetes, suggesting that IGF2 makes islets more susceptible to \u03b2-cell damage and immune attack. These results indicate that increased local levels of IGF2 in pancreatic islets may predispose to the onset of diabetes. This study unravels an unprecedented role of IGF2 on \u03b2-cells function.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Alba Casellas","Cristina Mallol","Ariana Salavert","Veronica Jimenez","Miquel Garcia","Judith Agudo","Merce Obach","Virginia Haurigot","Laia Vila","Maria Molas","Ricardo Lage","Meritxell Morro","Estefania Casana","Jesus Ruberte","Fatima Bosch"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m115.642041","first_seen_on":"2015-05-18T08:15:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1083-351X"],"journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1433713424,"links":["http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/early\/2015\/05\/13\/jbc.M115.642041.long"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/early\/2015\/05\/13\/jbc.M115.642041.full.pdf","pmid":"25971976","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Insulin-like Growth Factor 2 Overexpression Induces Beta-cell Dysfunction and Increases Beta-cell Susceptibility to Damage","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/insulinlike-growth-factor-2-overexpression-induces-%CE%B2cell-dysfunction-increases-betacell-susceptibili"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5200000,"mean":6.1332428102415,"rank":2394606,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2675359,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5200000,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171397,"mean":9.1140785665945,"rank":81921,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":83576,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171397,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28042,"mean":2.9793532327663,"rank":18781,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":8861,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28042,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":375,"mean":4.1398288770053,"rank":222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":140,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":375,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
