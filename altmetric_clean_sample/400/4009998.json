This finding suggests that greater NET availability in the locus ceruleus may serve a compensatory function of clearing elevated synaptic norepinephrine and maintaining anxious arousal symptoms in persons with PTSD.A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) found in the promoter region of the NET gene SLC6A2 (solute carrier family 6 [neurotransmitter transporter], member 2) (rs2242446) has been associated with panic disorder.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bee","authors":["Pietrzak, Robert H","Sumner, Jennifer A","Aiello, Allison E","Uddin, Monica","Neumeister, Alexander","Guffanti, Guia","Koenen, Karestan C"],"doi":"10.4088\/jcp.14l09346","first_seen_on":"2015-05-19T11:16:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1555-2101"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Clinical Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1432034129,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25919853","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25919853?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25919853","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Association of the rs2242446 polymorphism in the norepinephrine transporter gene SLC6A2 and anxious arousal symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder.","type":"article","volume":"76","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-rs2242446-polymorphism-norepinephrine-transporter-gene-slc6a2-anxious-arousal-symptoms-p"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5119197,"mean":6.0597847724544,"rank":2348032,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2643004,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5119197,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170954,"mean":9.0675806917692,"rank":81600,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":83441,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170954,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1769,"mean":7.5347160633484,"rank":1136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":612,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1769,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":9.4761851851852,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
