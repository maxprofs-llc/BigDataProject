Two subgroups were differentiated in each group according to the ablation profile: WFG subgroup, 109 eyes (45\/64, low\/moderate myopia groups) treated using the Advanced CustomVue platform (Abbott Medical Optics Inc.), and WFO subgroup, 112 eyes (54\/58, low\/moderate myopia groups) treated using the EX-500 platform (Alcon). Clinical outcomes were evaluated during a 6-month follow-up, including a vector analysis of astigmatic changes.\nSignificantly better postoperative uncorrected visual acuity and efficacy index was found in the WFG subgroups of each group (P\u22640.041). Postoperative spherical equivalent and cylinder were significantly higher in WFO subgroups (P\u22640.003). In moderate myopia group, a higher percentage of eyes with a postoperative cylinder \u22640.25 D was found in the WFG subgroup (90.6% vs 65.5%, P=0.002). In low and moderate myopia groups, the difference vector was significantly higher in the WFO subgroup compared to WFG (P<0.001). In moderate myopia group, the magnitude (P=0.008) and angle of error (P<0.001) were also significantly higher in the WFO subgroup. Significantly less induction of high order aberrations were found with WFG treatments in both low and moderate myopia groups (P\u22640.006).\nA more efficacious correction of myopic astigmatism providing a better visual outcome is achieved with WFG LASIK compared to WFO LASIK.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef752a83ee09648b51cd","authors":["Khalifa, Mounir A.","Alsahn, Mahmoud F.","Shaheen, Mohamed Shafik","Pi\u00f1ero, David P."],"doi":"10.18240\/ijo.2017.02.17","first_seen_on":"2017-02-13T16:02:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handle":"10045\/62999","handles":["10045\/62999"],"issns":["2222-3959 (Print)","2222-3959"],"issue":"2","journal":"International Journal of Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1487001734,"links":["http:\/\/rua.ua.es\/dspace\/handle\/10045\/62999","http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/10045\/62999"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/rua.ua.es\/dspace\/bitstream\/10045\/62999\/1\/2017_Khalifa_etal_IntJOphthalmol.pdf","pmid":"28251090","pubdate":"2017-02-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"IJO Press","title":"Comparative analysis of the efficacy of astigmatic correction after wavefront-guided and wavefront-optimized LASIK in low and moderate myopic eyes","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparative-analysis-efficacy-astigmatic-correction-after-wavefrontguided-wavefrontoptimized-lasik-l"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8204367,"mean":6.945700472644,"rank":6229741,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1104615,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8204367,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269397,"mean":12.909701547164,"rank":195342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":45771,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269397,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189,"mean":1.575,"rank":76,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":85,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.3714285714286,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RUA_Alicante\/statuses\/831171632748183553","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16361000],"posted_on":"2017-02-13T16:02:14+00:00","author":{"name":"RUA","url":"http:\/\/rua.ua.es\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/249489546\/LogoRUAportal1_normal.jpg","description":"Repositorio Institucional de la Universidad de Alicante (RUA) | Repositori Institucional de la Universitat d'Alacant (RUA)","id_on_source":"RUA_Alicante","tweeter_id":"44109239","geo":{"lt":38.35323,"ln":-0.48134,"country":"ES"},"followers":1129},"tweet_id":"831171632748183553"}],"facebook":[{"title":"RUA: Comparative analysis of the efficacy of astigmatic correction after wavefront-guided and wavefront-optimized LASIK in low and moderate myopic eyes","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1323225474393966&id=106044082778784","license":"public","citation_ids":[16361000],"posted_on":"2017-02-13T16:01:32+00:00","summary":"AIM: To evaluate and compare the efficacy of the astigmatic correction achieved with laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) in eyes with myopic astigmatism using wavefront-guided (WFG) and wavefront-optimized (WFO) ablation profiles.
