Its prognostic significance in patients with colorectal cancer is controversial. We performed a systematic review of data from published studies to assess the prognostic values of ctDNA in patients with colorectal cancer. We searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases to identify eligible studies reporting disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) stratified by ctDNA prior to December 6, 2016. We evaluated the quality and design of these studies. A total of 22 studies were eligible for systematic review. Among them, 11 studies investigated the prognostic value of ctDNA on disease-free survival (DFS). Seven of 11 studies showed that ctDNA was an independent variable to estimate the probability of DFS by multivariate analyses. Thirteen studies assessed the relationship between ctDNA and overall survival (OS). Eight of 13 studies showed that ctDNA was an independent predictor of worse OS through the use of multivariate analyses. This analysis provides evidence that ctDNA may be a prognostic biomarker, negatively correlated with the survival of patients with colorectal cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Gaowei Fan","Kuo Zhang","Xin Yang","Jiansheng Ding","Zujian Wang","Jinming Li"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0171991","first_seen_on":"2017-02-14T01:04:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"2","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1505804513,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0171991","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0171991","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0171991&fullSite"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0171991&type=printable","pmid":"28187169","pubdate":"2017-02-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0171991","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Prognostic value of circulating tumor DNA in patients with colon cancer: Systematic review","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0171991","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prognostic-value-circulating-tumor-dna-patients-colon-cancer-systematic-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.95,"score_history":{"1y":2.95,"6m":2.2,"3m":2.2,"1m":2.2,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8435952,"mean":7.094002543155,"rank":3318430,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5105927,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8435952,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":286286,"mean":12.672490734757,"rank":103727,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":181792,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":286286,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116244,"mean":10.657634954363,"rank":41810,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":74237,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116244,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5100,"mean":10.799957246519,"rank":1743,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":3345,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5100,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
