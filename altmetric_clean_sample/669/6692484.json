Run time was significantly slower for CFS than control subjects (p < 0.001). There was a significant interaction (p < 0.01) between group and speed for maximum hip angle during stance and swing phase with hip angle being significantly larger at 1.34 m\/sec for CFS than controls subjects for both cases (p < 0.05). Knee flexion during stance and swing phases was significantly larger for controls than CFS subjects at 0.45 m\/sec (p < 0.01). Ratio of stride length divided by leg length was significantly larger for the control subjects than for the CFS subjects with differences occurring at 0.45 and 0.89 m\/sec (p < 0.01) but not 1.34 m\/sec. The data indicate that CFS patients have gait abnormalities when compared to sedentary controls. These could be due to balance problems, muscle weakness, or central nervous system dysfunction; deciding which will require further research. Evaluation of gait may be a useful tool to measure outcome following therapeutic interventions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f6e","authors":["Boda, W L","Natelson, B H","Sisto, S A","Tapp, W N"],"first_seen_on":"2016-04-14T12:48:30+00:00","issns":["0022-510X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of the Neurological Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1460638081,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7595641"],"pmid":"7595641","pubdate":"1995-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Gait abnormalities in chronic fatigue syndrome.","type":"article","volume":"131","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gait-abnormalities-chronic-fatigue-syndrome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7551260,"mean":6.5206857693492,"rank":5715491,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1010796,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7551260,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269824,"mean":11.371750421572,"rank":189475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":42357,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269824,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1953,"mean":3.8446260245902,"rank":1513,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1953,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118,"mean":3.4024444444444,"rank":88,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
