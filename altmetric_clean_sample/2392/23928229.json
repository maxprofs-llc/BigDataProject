Accumulating evidence shows that single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in pre-miRNA or mature microRNA may affect the processing of microRNA (miRNA) and alter the expression of the miRNA, as well as its target gene. In this study we investigated the association between rs2910164 G\/C polymorphism and risk of ED in patients with CP, as well as the underlying molecular mechanism. MATERIAL AND METHODS Computational analysis was used to search for the target of miR-146a, and the luciferase reporter assay system was used to validate NOS1 to be the target gene of miR-146a. We also treated PC-3 cells with miR-146a mimics\/inhibitors to verify the negative regulatory relationship between miR-146a and NOS1, and real-time PCR and Western blot analysis were used to estimate the expression of the NOS1 mRNA and miR-146a. RESULTS The binding site of miR-146a was found to be located within the 3'-UTR of the NOS1 by searching an online miRNA database (www.mirdb.org), and luciferase reporter assay was done to confirm that NOS1 is a direct target gene of miR-146a. We also found that mRNA and protein expression level of NOS1 in PC-3 cells treated with miR-146a mimics and NOS1 siRNA was substantially down-regulated compared with scramble control, while cells treated with miR-146a inhibitors showed increased expression of NOS1. In addition, 705 people were recruited for our research - 342 CP patients with ED and 363 CP patients without ED - and we found that the presence of minor allele of rs2910164 polymorphism is significantly associated with reduced risk of ED in patients with CP. CONCLUSIONS The findings indicate a decreased risk of ED in patients with CP who are carriers of miR-146a rs2910164 C allele, and this association might be due to its ability to compromise the expression of miR-146a, and thereby increase the expression of its target gene, NOS1.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9273cf058f61000dd13","authors":["Ding, Jian","Tang, Yuxin","Tang, Zhengyan","Zhang, Xiangyang","Wang, Guilin"],"first_seen_on":"2017-08-16T21:32:04+00:00","issns":["1643-3750"],"journal":"Medical science monitor international medical journal of experimental and clinical research","last_mentioned_on":1502919111,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28218896"],"pmid":"28218896","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"A Variant in the Precursor of MicroRNA-146a is Responsible for Development of Erectile Dysfunction in Patients with Chronic Prostatitis via Targeting NOS1.","type":"article","volume":"23"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8386076,"mean":7.0651873001299,"rank":6364426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1136948,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8386076,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":162667,"mean":12.928364206411,"rank":116106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":28655,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":162667,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1043,"mean":2.7785335892514,"rank":524,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":356,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1043,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":0.91935483870968,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/howardleonhardt\/statuses\/897933952224083968","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23928229],"posted_on":"2017-08-16T21:31:51+00:00","author":{"name":"Howard Leonhardt","url":"http:\/\/www.leonhardtventures.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1976308755\/HowardPhoto_normal.jpg","description":"Leading Social Entrepreneur.
