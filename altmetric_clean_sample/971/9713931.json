Our calculations confirm that 1 million Irish people perished as a result of this disaster. This figure does not include the deaths among the 1.3 million emigrants who left Ireland during the Famine period. The Famine produced a significant drop in the fertility rate, and we estimate that more than 300,000 births did not take place as a result of the Famine. The effects were especially severe on the very young and the very old, a result echoed in the findings of demographic analyses of other famines. Our procedure permits a reconstruction of the Irish population by age and sex during the period 1821-1841. In addition, it yields year-by-year estimates of the birth rate over this period. We estimate that the rate fell by about 14 percent, a result robust to our assumptions regarding emigration. Economic historians have debated this issue, and we hope that our evidence, although preliminary, will be of assistance. Our analysis also permits year-by-year reconstruction of Irish population totals for the period 1821-1851. Two years are of particular interest. Virtually all recent writers, with the notable exception of Lee (1981), have suggested that the 1831 census returns overestimated the actual population resident in Ireland at that date. Our reconstruction supports the validity of the 1831 census figure. We obtain a total of 7,847,000, which is in good agreement with the disputed census figure of 7,767,000. But perhaps the most interesting figure is the population total for the end of 1845, the highest ever achieved in Ireland. We estimate that the population on the eve of the Great Famine was 8,525,000. Throughout the paper we have tried to highlight those areas in which the data are unreliable, unavailable, or distorted. We have tried to devise cross-checks for consistency and to test the sensitivity of the results to a range of assumptions. A case in point concerns the age-sex profile and volume of emigration to England, Scotland, and Wales. Additional work at the micro level would be helpful here. More solid evidence on Famine births would also be helpful. The parish registers we have sampled certainly provide a clue to trends, but we have only made a start in that respect. A much more comprehensive survey is needed to convey the national picture.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026d7","authors":["Boyle, P P","O Gr\u00e1da, C"],"first_seen_on":"2016-07-14T21:35:11+00:00","issns":["0070-3370"],"issue":"4","journal":"Demography","last_mentioned_on":1297276740,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3542599"],"pmid":"3542599","pubdate":"1986-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Demography","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth","statisticsastopic"],"title":"Fertility trends, excess mortality, and the Great Irish Famine.","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fertility-trends-excess-mortality-great-irish-famine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.416,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.416},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5355954,"mean":6.2702473819343,"rank":847610,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":4508729,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5355954,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105048,"mean":9.821315220806,"rank":18557,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":86491,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105048,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":576,"mean":10.716685217391,"rank":183,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":393,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":576,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":3.515,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
