Four periods were determined: 1999-2003, 2004-2006, 2007-2009 and\u00a0>\u00a02009. Five tumor subtypes were defined according to hormonal receptors (HR) and Her2: Luminal A (HR\u00a0+\u00a0Her2- Grade 1-2), Her2 (Her2+ HR-), Triple-negative (HR- Her2-), Luminal B Her2- (HR\u00a0+\u00a0Her2- Grade 3), Luminal B Her2+ (HR\u00a0+\u00a0HER2+).\nRates of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), adjuvant chemotherapy\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0trastuzumab, endocrine treatment, mastectomy and post mastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) were analyzed according to treatment periods with univariate and multivariate analysis. Overall and disease-free survivals were analyzed according to treatment periods adjusted for HR and then for tumor subtypes.\nRates of ALND, adjuvant chemotherapy and endocrine treatment varied significantly according to treatment periods, for HR positive and negative tumors. ALND rate decreased for all tumor subtypes with a decrease of adjuvant chemotherapy rate for Luminal A tumors and an increase for Luminal B Her2+ and Her2-tumors. Endocrine treatment rate decreased for Luminal A and increased for Luminal B Her2+ tumors. In multivariate analysis, these modifications with time remained significant. Mastectomy and PMRT rates increased. In multivariate analysis, overall and disease-free survivals increased during successive periods.\nA global therapeutic de-escalation in ALND and adjuvant systemic treatment, combined with an actual escalation in some specific subsets was demonstrated, but without negative impact on survival.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60f3cf058f610006cfb","authors":["Gilles Houvenaeghel","Eric Lambaudie","Monique Cohen","Jean-Marc Classe","Fabien Reyal","Jean-R\u00e9my Garbay","Sylvia Giard","Nicolas Chopin","Alejandra Martinez","Roman Rouzier","Emile Dara\u00ef","Pierre Emmanuel Colombo","Charles Coutant","Pierre Gimbergues","Pierre Azuar","Richard Villet","Christine Tunon de Lara","Emmanuel Barranger","Laura Sabiani","Anthony Goncalves"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.breast.2017.04.008","first_seen_on":"2017-05-07T16:47:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["09609776","1532-3080"],"journal":"The Breast","last_mentioned_on":1494175654,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28475932?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28475932","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms","endocrinology"],"title":"Therapeutic escalation \u2013 De-escalation: Data from 15.508 early breast cancer treated with upfront surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/therapeutic-escalation-deescalation-data-15508-early-breast-cancer-treated-upfront-surgery-sentinel"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8170298,"mean":6.9145785001388,"rank":7070704,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8170298,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237528,"mean":12.48910237573,"rank":193151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237528,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":609,"mean":3.2044407894737,"rank":501,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":609,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":2.8807692307692,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
