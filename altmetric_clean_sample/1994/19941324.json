Based on this theory, the increase in urbanisation, as a measure of ecological change, is associated with significant cultural changes of psychology. Whereas urbanisation is linked to greater individualistic values and materialistic attitudes, rural environments are strongly associated with collectivistic values like allegiance, prevalence of religion, and feelings of belonging and benevolence. Due to an increase in the German urbanisation rate over time, our study investigates whether Germany and the German-speaking countries around show the presumed changes in psychology. By using Google Books Ngram Viewer, we find that word frequencies, signifying individualistic (collectivistic) values, are positively (negatively) related to the urbanisation rate of Germany. Our results indicate that predictions about implications of an urbanising population for the psychology of culture hold true, supporting international universality of the social change and human development theory. Furthermore, we provide evidence for a predicted reversal for the time during and after World War II, reflecting Nazi propaganda and influence.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d73cf058f6100012af","authors":["Nadja Younes","Ulf-Dietrich Reips","Younes, Nadja","Reips, Ulf\u2010Dietrich"],"doi":"10.1002\/ijop.12428","first_seen_on":"2017-05-07T17:17:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00207594","1464-066X"],"journal":"International Journal of Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1500861105,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28474338?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28474338?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ijop.12428\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ijop.12428\/pdf","pmid":"28474338","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"The changing psychology of culture in German-speaking countries: A Google Ngram study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/changing-psychology-culture-germanspeaking-countries-google-ngram-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":0.75,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457582,"mean":7.1055906399159,"rank":4020094,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4249748,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457582,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250502,"mean":12.666422074163,"rank":117161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":125876,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250502,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":338,"mean":5.6625163204748,"rank":179,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":148,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":338,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":3.7083333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"RU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/internetmedassn\/statuses\/861268673587294208","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19941324],"posted_on":"2017-05-07T17:17:08+00:00","author":{"name":"IMA","url":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/internetmedicalassociation","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1841117291\/imaEditwhitefill_normal.png","description":"The Internet Medical Association.
