In kittens, we demonstrate that nasal afferent stimulation does not reinforce inspiratory activity prior to the expiratory thrust as it normally does in adult cats. These stimulations evoke an active expiration similar to but weaker than the expiratory thrusts observed under the same conditions during sneezing in adult cats. Sneezing can be elicited from three weeks of life. Among the different hypotheses discussed, the most likely explanation appears to be the immaturity of medullary respiratory connections.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f6100082af","authors":["Wallois, F","Macron, J M","Larnicol, N","Rose, D"],"first_seen_on":"2017-05-08T07:01:52+00:00","issns":["0959-4965"],"issue":"3","journal":"NeuroReport","last_mentioned_on":1494230309,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8477044","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/?term=Macron%20JM%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_uid=8477044"],"pmid":"8477044","pubdate":"1993-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"The sneeze: maturation of the reflex in kittens.","type":"article","volume":"4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8172683,"mean":6.9158600214652,"rank":3849959,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4140876,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8172683,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237492,"mean":12.426784728684,"rank":110550,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":119661,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237492,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1654,"mean":3.5615620084694,"rank":680,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":930,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1654,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":7.0838148148148,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/rifish\/statuses\/861476163159568385","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19949324],"posted_on":"2017-05-08T07:01:37+00:00","author":{"name":"richard fisher","url":"https:\/\/about.me\/richardfisher","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/677542501889286145\/lkOEOXi3_normal.jpg","description":"I'm the Editor of BBC Future: in-depth stories about science, tech, health and more http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/future","id_on_source":"rifish","tweeter_id":"16027100","geo":{"lt":51.50853,"ln":-0.12574,"country":"GB"},"followers":2892},"tweet_id":"861476163159568385"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/WanderingGaia\/statuses\/861490474074476544","license":"gnip","rt":["rifish"],"citation_ids":[19949324],"posted_on":"2017-05-08T07:58:29+00:00","author":{"name":"Gaia Vince","url":"http:\/\/www.WanderingGaia.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/280026047\/gaia_normal.jpg","description":"Writer, broadcaster, author (Adventures In The Anthropocene http:\/\/amzn.to\/1KKAUc7) on a voyage around the world meeting the remarkable.","id_on_source":"WanderingGaia","tweeter_id":"50219804","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":4821},"tweet_id":"861490474074476544"}]}}
