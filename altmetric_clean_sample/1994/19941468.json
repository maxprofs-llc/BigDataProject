IBD was induced by feeding DSS to the mice, and blood and colon tissues were collected on the 7(th) d after IBD modeling to determine clinical symptoms, colonic in\ufb02ammation and the potential mechanisms involved.\nThe DSS + HRW group exhibited significantly attenuated weight loss and a lower extent of disease activity index compared with the DSS group on the 7(th) d (P < 0.05). HRW exerted protective effects against colon shortening and colonic wall thickening in contrast to the DSS group (P < 0.05). The histological study demonstrated milder inflammation in the DSS + HRW group, which was similar to normal inflammatory levels, and the macroscopic and microcosmic damage scores were lower in this group than in the DSS group (P < 0.05). The oxidative stress parameters, including MDA and MPO in the colon, were significantly decreased in the DSS + HRW group compared with the DSS group (P < 0.05). Simultaneously, the protective indicators, superoxide dismutase and glutathione, were markedly increased with the use of HRW. Inflammatory factors were assessed, and the results showed that the DSS + HRW group exhibited significantly reduced levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 compared with the DSS group (P < 0.05). In addition, the pivotal proteins involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, including p-eIF2\u03b1, ATF4, XBP1s and CHOP, were dramatically reduced after HRW treatment in contrast to the control group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, HRW treatment markedly up-regulated HO-1 expression, and the use of ZnPP obviously reversed the protective role of HRW. In the DSS + HRW + ZnPP group, colon shortening and colonic wall thickening were significantly aggravated, and the macroscopic damage scores were similar to those of the DSS + HRW group (P < 0.05). The histological study also showed more serious colonic damage that was similar to the DSS group.\nHRW has a significant therapeutic potential in IBD by inhibiting inflammatory factors, oxidative stress and ER stress and by up-regulating HO-1 expression.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d0f","authors":["Nai-Ying Shen","Jian-Bin Bi","Jing-Yao Zhang","Si-Min Zhang","Jing-Xian Gu","Kai Qu","Chang Liu"],"doi":"10.3748\/wjg.v23.i8.1375","first_seen_on":"2017-05-07T17:36:40+00:00","issns":["1007-9327"],"issue":"8","journal":"World Journal of Gastroenterology","last_mentioned_on":1494175630,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5330822\/"],"pmcid":"PMC5330822","pmid":"28293084","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Baishideng Publishing Group Inc","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1375","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Hydrogen-rich water protects against in\ufb02ammatory bowel disease in mice by inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress and promoting heme oxygenase-1 expression","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hydrogenrich-water-protects-against-in%EF%AC%82ammatory-bowel-disease-mice-inhibiting-endoplasmic-reticulum"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8170298,"mean":6.9145785001388,"rank":7070704,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8170298,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237528,"mean":12.489101323218,"rank":193151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237528,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3649,"mean":3.1858020833333,"rank":2539,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3649,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.6833333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Hydrogen-rich water protects against in\ufb02ammatory bowel disease in mice by inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress and promoting heme oxygenase-1 expression","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1995379314017139&id=1528174517404290","license":"public","citation_ids":[19941468],"posted_on":"2017-05-07T16:47:10+00:00","summary":"To investigate the therapeutic effect of hydrogen-rich water (HRW) on in\ufb02ammatory bowel disease (IBD) and to explore the potential mechanisms involved.Male mice were randomly divided into the following four groups: control group, in which the ...","author":{"name":"HDN Hydrogen Water Flask","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/1528174517404290","facebook_wall_name":"HDN Hydrogen Water Flask","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/1528174517404290\/picture","id_on_source":"1528174517404290"}}]}}
