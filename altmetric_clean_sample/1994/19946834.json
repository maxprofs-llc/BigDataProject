This Bayesian network meta-analysis assesses the role of immunotherapies and targeted therapies for advanced melanoma. We retrieved randomized controlled trials testing immune, BRAF- or MEK-targeted therapies for advanced melanoma from electronic databases. A Bayesian network model compared therapies using hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and odds ratio (OR) for response rate (RR), along with 95% credible intervals (95% CrI), and probabilities of drugs outperforming others. We assessed the impact of PD-L1 expression on immunotherapy efficacy. Sixteen studies evaluating eight therapies in 6849 patients were analyzed. For OS, BRAF-MEK combination and PD-1 single agent ranked similarly and outperformed all other treatments. For PFS, BRAF-MEK combination surpassed all other options, including CTLA-4-PD-1 dual blockade hazard ratio (HR: 0.56; 95% CrI: 0.33-0.97; probability better 96.2%), whereas BRAF single agent ranked close to CTLA-4-PD-1 blockade. For RR, BRAF-MEK combination was superior to all treatments including CTLA-4-PD-1 (OR: 2.78; 1.18-6.30; probability better 97.1%). No OS data were available for CTLA-4-PD-1 blockade at the time of systematic review, although PFS and RR results suggested that this combination could also bring meaningful benefit. PD-L1 expression, as presently defined, failed to inform patient selection to PD-1-based immunotherapy. BRAF-MEK combination seemed an optimal therapy for BRAF-mutated patients, whereas PD-1 inhibitors seemed optimal for BRAF wild-type patients. Longer follow-up is needed to ascertain the role of CTLA-4-PD-1 blockade. Immunotherapy biomarkers remain as an unmet need.","altmetric_jid":"53222dc82a83ee27268b4568","authors":["Silveira Nogueira Lima, Joao Paulo","Georgieva, Mina","Haaland, Benjamin","Lima Lopes, Gilberto"],"doi":"10.1002\/cam4.1001","endpage":"1153","first_seen_on":"2017-05-08T03:10:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["20457634","2045-7634"],"issue":"6","journal":"Cancer Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1494673695,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cam4.1001\/abstract;jsessionid=BAF199E1FF65569F99463974DEF4DBBC.f03t03","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cam4.1001\/abstract","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1002\/cam4.1001"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cam4.1001\/pdf","pmid":"28463413","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"1143","title":"A systematic review and network meta-analysis of immunotherapy and targeted therapy for advanced melanoma","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/systematic-review-network-metaanalysis-immunotherapy-targeted-therapy-advanced-melanoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":2.25,"6m":2.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8282164,"mean":6.9834712931808,"rank":3482568,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4746927,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8282164,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245080,"mean":12.370299250446,"rank":94572,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":147872,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245080,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":507,"mean":5.552347826087,"rank":133,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":367,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":507,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":3.4142857142857,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
