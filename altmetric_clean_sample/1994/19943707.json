We report here on our structural investigations of the pre-formed chitin matrix and the initial deposition and growth of goethite (alpha-FeOOH) crystals within the matrix. By using cryo-techniques, in which unstained sections of the teeth are examined in a frozen-hydrated state in a transmission electron microscope (TEM), we were able to characterize the process without introducing artifacts normally associated with the staining, dehydration, and embedding required for conventional TEM. The unmineralized matrix consists of relatively well ordered, densely packed arrays of chitin fibers, with only a few nanometers between adjacent fibers. There are clearly no pre-formed compartments that control goethite crystal size and shape; rather, crystals must push aside or engulf the fibers as they grow. By examining teeth nearly row-by-row around the onset of mineralization, we were able to image the first-formed mineral within the chitin matrix. These linear deposits of goethite appear to nucleate on the chitin fibers, which thus control the orientation of the crystals. Crystal growth, on the other hand, is apparently not influenced by the matrix, in contrast to many other biomineralization systems.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f3d","authors":["Eli D.
