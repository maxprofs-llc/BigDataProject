At first, we measure the performance of two conventional dominance-based approaches with unbounded archive on a benchmark of enumerable binary optimization problems with tunable ruggedness, objective space dimension, and objective correlation (\u03c1MNK-landscapes). Precisely, we investigate the expected runtime required by a global evolutionary optimization algorithm with an ergodic variation operator (GSEMO) and by a neighborhood-based local search heuristic (PLS), to identify a [Formula: see text]-approximation of the Pareto set. Then, we define a number of problem features characterizing the fitness landscape, and we study their intercorrelation and their association with algorithm runtime on the benchmark instances. At last, with a mixed-effects multi-linear regression we assess the individual and joint effect of problem features on the performance of both algorithms, within and across the instance classes defined by benchmark parameters. Our analysis reveals further insights into the importance of ruggedness and multi-modality to characterize instance hardness for this family of multi-objective optimization problems and algorithms.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4c93cf058f61000003a","authors":["Fabio Daolio","Arnaud Liefooghe","S\u00e9bastien Verel","Hern\u00e1n Aguirre","Kiyoshi Tanaka"],"doi":"10.1162\/evco_a_00193","first_seen_on":"2017-05-07T18:37:48+00:00","issns":["1063-6560","1530-9304"],"journal":"Evolutionary Computation","last_mentioned_on":1494182255,"links":["http:\/\/www.mitpressjournals.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1162\/EVCO_a_00193?ai=t9&mi=6fciq5&af=R","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1162\/evco_a_00193"],"pmid":"27689467","publisher":" MIT Press  One Rogers Street, Cambridge, MA 02142-1209 USA journals-info@mit.edu  ","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Mathematics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology","statisticsastopic"],"title":"Problem Features versus Algorithm Performance on Rugged Multiobjective Combinatorial Fitness Landscapes","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8170298,"mean":6.9145785001388,"rank":4329668,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2268577,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8170298,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237528,"mean":12.489065116808,"rank":132003,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":83557,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237528,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86,"mean":2.2686588235294,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"NL":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/pyguide\/statuses\/861288922193776644","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19942045],"posted_on":"2017-05-07T18:37:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Data science \u2728","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/850623316331253760\/PEk9_0DQ_normal.jpg","description":"A collection of adventures, thoughts, and random tidbits by @mdavarynejad on #DataScience, #DataAnalytics, #MachineLearning and #BigData","id_on_source":"pyguide","tweeter_id":"734651196263239680","geo":{"lt":52.00667,"ln":4.35556,"country":"NL"},"followers":745},"tweet_id":"861288922193776644"}]}}
