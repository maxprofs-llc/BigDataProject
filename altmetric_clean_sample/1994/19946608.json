On first admission, subjects underwent closed-loop control with SC delivery of a fast-acting insulin analogue for 24\u2009hr. Following the implantation of a DiaPort(\u00ae) IP insulin delivery system, the identical 24\u2009hr trial was performed with IP regular insulin delivery. The clinical protocol included three unannounced meals with 70, 40, and 70\u2009g carbohydrate. Primary endpoint was time blood glucose (BG) spent in 80-140\u2009mg\/dL (4.4-7.7\u2009mmol\/L).\nPercent time spent within 80-140\u2009mg\/dL range was significantly higher for IP delivery than SC delivery: 39.8\u2009\u00b1\u20097.6 vs. 25.6\u2009\u00b1\u200913.1 (p=0.03). Mean BG (mg\/dL) and percent time spent within broader 70-180\u2009mg\/dL range were also significantly better with IP insulin: 151.0\u2009\u00b1\u200911.0 vs. 190.0\u2009\u00b1\u200931.0 (p=0.004) and 65.7\u2009\u00b1\u20099.2 vs. 43.9\u2009\u00b1\u200914.7 (p=0.001), respectively. Superiority of glucose control with IP insulin came from reduced time spent in hyperglycemia (>180\u2009mg\/dL: 32.4\u2009\u00b1\u20098.9 vs. 53.5\u2009\u00b1\u200917.4, p=0.014; >250\u2009mg\/dL: 5.9\u2009\u00b1\u20095.6 vs. 23.0\u2009\u00b1\u200911.3, p=0.0004). Higher daily doses of insulin (IU) were delivered with IP route (43.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1 vs. 32.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1, p<0.001) with no increased percent time spent <70\u2009mg\/dL (IP: 2.5\u2009\u00b1\u20092.9 vs. SC: 4.1\u2009\u00b1\u20095.3, p=0.42).\nGlycemic regulation with fully-automated AP delivering IP insulin was superior to SC insulin delivery. This pilot study provides proof-of-concept for an AP system combining a ZMPC algorithm with IP insulin delivery.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026fc","authors":["Eyal Dassau","Eric Renard","J\u00e9r\u00f4me Place","Anne Farret","Marie-Jos\u00e9 Pelletier","Justin Lee","Lauren M.
