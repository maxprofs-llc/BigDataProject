In this report, we investigate the immunopathologic consequences of exposing dogs twice to aerosols of BeO. Dogs previously exposed to aerosols of 500 or 1000 degrees C calcined BeO to achieve an initial lung burden (ILB) of either 50 or 17 micrograms\/kg body wt were exposed a second time to BeO calcined at 500 degrees C, 2.5 years after the first exposure, to achieve an ILB of about 50 micrograms\/kg body wt. Immune responses of peripheral blood and lung lymphocytes were measured at 0, 14, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 165, 180, and 210 days postexposure (dpe), and dogs were euthanized at 210 dpe. Be-specific immune responses occurred in blood at 30 dpe and again at 150 to 210 dpe. Only sporadic positive responses were seen among lung lymphocytes when cells were cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum. In contrast, samples collected at 165, 180, and 210 dpe and incubated with 10% dog serum showed a large number of positive responses in both blood and lung. Histologic lesions were characterized by perivascular and interstitial infiltrates of lymphocytes and macrophages with progression to patchy granulomatous pneumonia accompanied by focal septal fibrosis. We conclude that Be-induced granulomatous and fibrotic lung lesions are accompanied by Be-specific immune responses within the lung but these changes do not appear to be cumulative if enough time has elapsed between exposures.","ads_id":"1992ER.....59..400H","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027ee","authors":["Haley, P J","Finch, G L","Hoover, M D","Mewhinney, J A","Bice, D E","Muggenburg, B A","Patrick J.
