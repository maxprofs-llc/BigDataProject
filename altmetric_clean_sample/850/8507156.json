The uncomplete knowledge in soil modifications and a lack of clear design practices laid the foundation of this work. The aim of this study was to determine optimal hydraulic loads and to observe the main critical parameters affecting treating performances and hydraulic loads acceptance. For this purpose, a soil rich in clay and backfill was chosen to perform column infiltration tests with TWW. Two loading rates and two loading modes were compared to study the influence of an intermittent feeding. Inlet and outlet waters were periodically analysed and columns were instrumented with balances, tensiometers, O2 and temperature probes. Soil physico-chemical characteristics were also taken into account to better understand the modification of the soil. One of the main expectations of tertiary treatment is to improve phosphate removal. A particular attention was thus given to phosphorus retention. The interest of an intermittent feeding in presence of a soil with high clay content was showed. This study highlighted that an intermittent feeding could make possible the use of a clay-rich soil for water infiltration.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d63cf058f61000114d","authors":["Sara Bisone"],"doi":"10.1080\/09593330.2016.1185165","endpage":"12","first_seen_on":"2016-06-06T09:18:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0959-3330","1479-487X"],"journal":"Environmental Technology","last_mentioned_on":1465204767,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/09593330.2016.1185165"],"pmid":"27255546","pubdate":"2016-06-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Influence of loading rate and modes on infiltration of treated wastewater in soil-based constructed wetland","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-loading-rate-modes-infiltration-treated-wastewater-soilbased-constructed-wetland"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7861897,"mean":6.6582651640212,"rank":3654940,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":4031054,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7861897,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269043,"mean":11.389721010102,"rank":122104,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":138133,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269043,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":370,"mean":1.8261734417344,"rank":126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":236,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":370,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.401875,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
