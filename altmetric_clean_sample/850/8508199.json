Over the last 25 years, molecular mechanisms triggered by natural anticancer compounds were investigated. Emerging research showed that molecules of natural origins are useful for both preventive and therapeutic purposes by targeting essential hallmarks and enabling characteristics described by Hanahan and Weinberg. Moreover, natural compounds were able to change the differentiation status of selected cell types. One of the earliest response of cells treated by pharmacologically active compounds is the change of its morphology leading to ultra-structural perturbations: changes in membrane composition, cytoskeleton integrity, alterations of the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria and of the nucleus lead to formation of morphological alterations that are a characteristic of both compound and cancer type preceding cell death. Apoptosis and autophagy were traditionally considered as the most prominent cell death or cell death-related mechanisms. By now multiple other cell death modalities were described and most likely involved in response to chemotherapeutic treatment. It can be hypothesized that especially necrosis-related phenotypes triggered by various treatments or evolving from apoptotic or autophagic mechanisms, provide a more efficient therapeutic outcome depending on cancer type and genetic phenotype of the patient. In fact, the recent discovery of multiple regulated forms of necrosis and the initial elucidation of the corresponding cell signaling pathways appear nowadays as important tools to clarify the immunogenic potential of non-canonical forms of cell death induction.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f610003507","authors":["Diederich, Marc","Cerella, Claudia"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.semcancer.2016.06.001","first_seen_on":"2016-06-06T10:08:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1096-3650","1044579X"],"journal":"Seminars in Cancer Biology","last_mentioned_on":1465230529,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27262793?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27262793","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Non-canonical programmed cell death mechanisms triggered by natural compounds","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/noncanonical-programmed-cell-death-mechanisms-triggered-natural-compounds-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7861897,"mean":6.6582651640212,"rank":5682249,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1899642,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7861897,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269043,"mean":11.389630875476,"rank":172511,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":80981,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269043,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":298,"mean":3.0166666666667,"rank":178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":96,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":298,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":2.1,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
