Artifacts caused by mechanical problems in the camera or from the patient's media or pupil variations are invisible until the film is developed. Most artifacts, however, can be seen in the viewfinder during the photographic session and can be corrected. When artifactual problems occur, they should be documented in the patient's record, especially if they degrade the quality of the photograph.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a7c","authors":["Landon, S"],"first_seen_on":"2016-06-06T10:12:20+00:00","issns":["0744-7132"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Ophthalmic Nursing & Technology","last_mentioned_on":1465207935,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2625702"],"pmid":"2625702","pubdate":"1989-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["nursing","ophthalmology"],"title":"Artifacts in fundus photographs.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/artifacts-fundus-photographs"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7861897,"mean":6.6582651640212,"rank":1930954,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4846133,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7861897,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269044,"mean":11.389676631616,"rank":85845,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":179286,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269044,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":55.5,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Fundus photography","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=723967693#altmetric_citation_dd2d43a4-9c56-4f0b-bc14-1f79c7a7112f","license":"public","citation_ids":[8508309],"posted_on":"2016-06-06T10:12:15+00:00","summary":"Fundus photography involves capturing a photograph of the back of the eye i.e. fundus.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=13863144","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Rjwilmsi","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Rjwilmsi"}}]}}
