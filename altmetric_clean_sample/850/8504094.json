One diagnostic criterion for PTSD is avoidance of stimuli that are related to the traumatic stress. Using a predator odor stress conditioned place avoidance (CPA) model, rats can be divided into groups based on stress reactivity, as measured by avoidance of the odor-paired context. Avoider rats, which show high stress reactivity, exhibit persistent avoidance of stress-paired context and escalated alcohol drinking. Here, we examined the potential role of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), a neuropeptide that promotes anxiety-like behavior in mediating avoidance and escalated alcohol drinking after stress. CRF is highly expressed in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a region that mediates stress reactivity and alcohol drinking\/seeking. We hypothesized that vmPFC CRF-CRFR1 signaling contributes functionally to stress-induced avoidance and escalated alcohol self-administration. In Experiment 1, adult male Wistar rats were exposed to predator odor stress in a CPA paradigm, indexed for avoidance of odor-paired context, and CRF-immunoreactivity in vmPFC and dmPFC was measured via immunohistochemistry. Avoiders exhibited higher levels of CRF-immunoreactive cells in vmPFC, but not the dmPFC, post-stress. In Experiment 2, rats were tested for avoidance of a context repeatedly paired with intra-vmPFC CRF infusions. In Experiment 3, rats were stressed and indexed, then tested for the effects of intra-vmPFC CRFR1 antagonism on avoidance and alcohol self-administration. Intra-vmPFC CRF infusion produced avoidance of a paired context, and intra-vmPFC CRFR1 antagonism reversed avoidance of a stress-paired context, but did not alter post-stress alcohol self-administration. These findings suggest that vmPFC CRF-CRFR1 signaling mediates avoidance of stimuli paired with traumatic stress.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031a0","authors":["Schreiber, Allyson L","Lu, Yi-Ling","Baynes, Brittni B","Richardson, Heather N","Gilpin, Nicholas W"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neuropharm.2016.05.008","first_seen_on":"2016-06-06T06:49:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-7064","00283908"],"issue":"Pt A","journal":"Neuropharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1464978043,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.neuropharm.2016.05.008","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27235163"],"pmid":"27235163","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology","pharmacology"],"title":"Corticotropin-releasing factor in ventromedial prefrontal cortex mediates avoidance of a traumatic stress-paired context","type":"article","volume":"113","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/corticotropinreleasing-factor-ventromedial-prefrontal-cortex-mediates-avoidance-traumatic-stresspair"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7849747,"mean":6.6509658923939,"rank":6799105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7849747,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268909,"mean":11.390430548737,"rank":224134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268909,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1942,"mean":5.0066264811953,"rank":1648,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1942,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":4.2025066666667,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
