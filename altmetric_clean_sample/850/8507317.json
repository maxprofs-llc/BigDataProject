In humans, research suggests disrupted sleep impairs consolidation of extinction, though no studies have examined this experimentally using total sleep deprivation.\nSeventy-one healthy controls underwent a paradigm to acquire conditioned fear to a visual cue. Twenty-four hours after fear conditioning, participants underwent extinction learning. Twenty-four hours after extinction learning, participants underwent extinction recall. Participants were randomized to three groups: 1) well-rested throughout testing (\"normal sleep\"; n = 21); 2) 36 hours total sleep deprivation before extinction learning (\"pre-extinction deprivation\"; n = 25); or 3) 36 hours total sleep deprivation after extinction learning and before extinction recall (\"post-extinction deprivation\"; n = 25). The groups were compared on blink EMG reactivity to the condition stimulus during extinction learning and recall.\nThere were no differences among the three groups during extinction learning. During extinction recall, the pre-extinction deprivation group demonstrated significantly less extinction recall than the normal sleep group. There was no significant difference between the normal sleep and post-extinction deprivation group during extinction recall. Results indicated sleep deprivation prior to extinction training significantly disrupts extinction recall.\nThese findings suggest that (1) sleep deprivation in the immediate aftermath of trauma could be a potential contributor to PTSD development and maintenance via interference with natural extinction processes and (2) management of sleep symptoms should be considered during extinction-based therapy.","altmetric_jid":"567962162a83ee58358b4572","authors":["Laura D.
