In this study we explored the anti-inflammatory activities of the methanolic extract of shea butter (SBE) using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced murine macrophage cell line J774. It was observed that SBE significantly reduced the levels of LPS-induced nitric oxide, Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukins, 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), and -12 (IL-12) in the culture supernatants in a dose dependent manner. Expression of pro-inflammatory enzymes, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were also inhibited by SBE. These anti-inflammatory effects were due to an inhibitory action of SBE on LPS-induced iNOS, COX-2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-12 mRNA expressions. Moreover, SBE efficiently suppressed I\u03baB phosphorylation and NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation induced by LPS. These findings explain the molecular bases of shea butter's bioactivity against various inflammatory conditions and substantiate it as a latent source of novel therapeutic agents.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007c05","authors":["Verma N","Chakrabarti R","Das RH","Gautam HK","Nandini Verma","Rina Chakrabarti","Rakha H.
