Zinc diethyldithiocarbamate was classified as a mild irritant by the Draize eye irritation test. When ZDEC-SRM coated contact lenses were applied to rabbit eyes, Draize scores increased in proportion to both the ZDEC and PU concentrations used for coating. Furthermore, correlation with the cytotoxic potential (gamma = -0.93) was better than with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities of tears from rabbit eyes wearing these coated lenses (gamma = 0.78). In conclusion, in vivo eye irritancy induced by wearing lenses could be estimated quantitatively with the cytotoxic potentials using a colony assay. Furthermore, we could compare different sensitivities caused by the same set of SRMs among three different sites of tissue. As a result, the order of sensitivity was eye > muscle > skin.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6213cf058f610007b99","authors":["T Tsuchiya","T Arai","J Ohhashi","K Imai","H Kojima","S Miyamoto","H Hata","Y Ikarashi","K Toyoda","M Takahashi"],"doi":"10.1002\/jbm.820270707","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T20:36:07+00:00","issns":["0021-9304"],"issue":"7","journal":"Journal of Biomedical Materials Research","last_mentioned_on":1392152272,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8395531"],"pmid":"8395531","pubdate":"1993-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"JOHN WILEY & SONS INC","subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Rabbit eye irritation caused by wearing toxic contact lenses and their cytotoxicities: in vivo\/in vitro correlation study using standard reference materials.","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rabbit-eye-irritation-caused-wearing-toxic-contact-lenses-cytotoxicities-vivoin-vitro-correlation-st"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5098410,"mean":6.041212277793,"rank":2693748,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1740186,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5098410,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125644,"mean":8.1451475211513,"rank":62409,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":47368,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125644,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":2.0161016949153,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"PT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SalHelder\/status\/433344155524141056","license":"public","citation_ids":[2254891],"posted_on":"2014-02-11T20:57:52+00:00","author":{"name":"H\u00e9lder Salgueiro","url":"http:\/\/chatos-do-democrito.blogs.sapo.pt\/","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/530413072951701504\/gdOjCtsV_normal.png","description":"socialista democr\u00e1tico | laicista | extremo-esquerdista assumido | progressista | cin\u00e9filo | prog-rock | snob amador acompanhado de vinagre","id_on_source":"SalHelder","tweeter_id":"93847902","geo":{"lt":"40.033265","ln":"-7.8896263","country":"PT"},"followers":635},"tweet_id":"433344155524141056"}]}}
