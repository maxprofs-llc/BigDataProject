Studies on the role of NRs in thyroid cancer are limited. Objective: The objective of the study was to examine systematically the expression of the 48 human NRs in a series of benign and malignant thyroid tissues. Within the papillary carcinoma cohort, we sought to determine if NR expression differed significantly by BRAF mutation status. Patients and methods: RNA was isolated from multinodular goiter (MNG; n=6), papillary carcinoma (PTC, n=14), follicular carcinoma (FC; n=5), and H\u00fcrthle cell carcinoma (HCC; n=7). The 48 human NRs were profiled in this panel by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. Protein expression for selected NRs (Rev-erb\u03b1 and LXR-\u03b2) was examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on tissue microarrays comprising benign and malignant thyroid tissues. Results: Across all groups of benign and malignant thyroid tissue, there was prominent expression of LXR-\u03b2 and ROR-\u03b3. Key findings in PTC were marked overexpression of RXR-\u03b3 and Rev-erb\u03b1 compared to MNG. Within the PTC cohort, when BRAF(V600E) tumors were compared with wild type BRAF, there was relative upregulation of RXR-\u03b3 and Rev-erb\u03b1 and downregulation of AR, ERR-\u03b3, and ROR-\u03b3. In FC, EAR-2 was overexpressed, while PPAR-\u03b1 and PPAR-\u03b4 were underexpressed compared to MNG. The NR expression profile of HCC was distinct, characterized by significant downregulation of a wide range of NRs. IHC for Rev-erb\u03b1 and LXR-\u03b2 localized protein expression to the tumor cells. Moderate to strong Rev-erb\u03b1 immunostaining was seen in 22 out of 23 PTC, and, overall, staining was stronger than in the benign group. Conclusions: These results represent the first systematic examination of NR expression in thyroid cancer. Our finding of tumor-specific patterns of NR expression, as well as significant differences in NR expression between BRAF(V600E) and wild type BRAF PTC, provides a basis for further mechanistic studies and highlights potential novel therapeutic targets for this malignancy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003667","authors":["Mond M","Alexiadis M","Eriksson N","Davis M","Muscat G","Fuller P","Gilfillan C"],"doi":"10.1089\/thy.2013.0509","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T19:50:02+00:00","issns":["1050-7256"],"issue":"","journal":"Thyroid","last_mentioned_on":1393603462,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24559275"],"pmid":"24559275","pubdate":"2014-02-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Nuclear receptor expression in human differentiated thyroid tumors.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nuclear-receptor-expression-human-differentiated-thyroid-tumors-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633425,"mean":4.921826751301,"rank":2015222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":946662,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633425,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93018,"mean":7.0236569659311,"rank":48106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":24305,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93018,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":580,"mean":2.8541139896373,"rank":290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":189,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":580,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.3958333333333,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
