Next-generation sequencing provides a unique opportunity to explore gut microbial communities and their interactions with hosts. However, studies on gut microbiomes have been conducted predominantly in humans and land animals. Not much is known on gut microbiomes of aquatic animals and their changes under changing environmental conditions. To address this shortcoming, we determined the microbial gene catalogue, and investigated changes in the microbial composition and host-microbe interactions in the intestine of Asian seabass in response to starvation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b9","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2164-15-266","first_seen_on":"2014-04-06T17:56:07+00:00","issns":["1471-2164"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1416396486,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/15\/266\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24708260?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/15\/266","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24708260?dopt..","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24708260?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2164-15-266.pdf","pmid":"24708260","pubdate":"2014-04-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"266","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"The intestinal microbiome of fish under starvation.","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intestinal-microbiome-fish-under-starvation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4527185,"mean":5.2867864119486,"rank":812299,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":3710005,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4527185,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107285,"mean":8.0437011856382,"rank":22417,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":84721,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107285,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4162,"mean":3.6244128815189,"rank":744,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":3408,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4162,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":225,"mean":3.1027142857143,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":225,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":4,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":42,"Student  > Doctoral Student":10,"Student  > Ph.
