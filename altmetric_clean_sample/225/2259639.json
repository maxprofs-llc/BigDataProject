Furthermore, most have focused on a dichotomous measure of transition to psychosis rather than a continuous measure of functional outcome. We aimed to investigate the relative value of neurocognitive and clinical variables for predicting both transition to psychosis and functional outcome.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Tim Ziermans","Sanne de Wit","Patricia Schothorst","Mirjam Sprong","Herman van Engeland","Ren\u00e9 Kahn","Sarah Durston"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0093994","first_seen_on":"2014-04-06T20:02:38+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"4","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1398241503,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0093994"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0093994.pdf","pmid":"24705808","pubdate":"2014-04-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e93994","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Neurocognitive and Clinical Predictors of Long-Term Outcome in Adolescents at Ultra-High Risk for Psychosis: A 6-Year Follow-Up","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neurocognitive-clinical-predictors-longterm-outcome-adolescents-ultrahigh-risk-psychosis-6year-follo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7869754,"mean":6.6657815725544,"rank":3115352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4730294,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7869754,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176442,"mean":7.3581386979219,"rank":54214,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":121488,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176442,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110741,"mean":10.312491385227,"rank":41095,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":69128,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110741,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4410,"mean":12.433507371286,"rank":1715,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":2680,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4410,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
