Recently, chemically standardized alcoholic extract of Bacopa monniera (BM) has been developed and currently available as over the counter herbal remedy for memory enhancement in children and adults. However, the consumption of herbal drugs has been reported to alter the expression of drug metabolizing enzymes and membrane transporters. Present study in male Sprague-Dawley rat was performed to evaluate the effect of memory enhancing standardized extract of BM on hepatic and intestinal cytochrome P450 3A and P-glycoprotein expression and activity. The BM (31 mg\/kg\/day) was orally administered for one week in BM pre-treated group while the control group received the same amount of vehicle for the same time period. The BM treatment decreased the cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) mediated testosterone 6\u03b2-hydroxylation activity of the liver and intestine by 2 and 1.5 fold, respectively compared to vehicle treated control. Similarly pretreatment with BM extract decreased the expression of intestinal P-glycoprotein (Pgp) as confirmed by Western blot analysis but did not alter the expression of hepatic Pgp. To investigate whether this BM pretreatment mediated decrease in activity of CYP3A and Pgp would account for the alteration of respective substrate or not, pharmacokinetic study with carbamazepine and digoxin was performed in BM pre-treated rats and vehicle treated rats. Carbamazepine and digoxin were used as CYP3A and Pgp probe drugs, respectively. Significant increase in AUC and Cmax of carbamazepine (4 and 1.8 fold) and digoxin (1.3 and 1.2 fold), respectively following the BM pre-treatment confirmed the down regulation of CYP3A and Pgp.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Rajbir Singh","Jagadeesh Panduri","Devendra Kumar","Deepak Kumar","Hardik Chandsana","Rachumallu Ramakrishna","Rabi Sankar Bhatta"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0072517","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T20:54:48+00:00","issns":[""],"issue":"8","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1391694039,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3756011\/"],"pmcid":"PMC3756011","pmid":"24015255","pubdate":"2014-04-04T20:13:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Evaluation of Memory Enhancing Clinically Available Standardized Extract of Bacopa monniera on P-Glycoprotein and Cytochrome P450 3A in Sprague-Dawley Rats","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-memory-enhancing-clinically-available-standardized-extract-bacopa-monniera-pglycoprotein"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626012,"mean":4.9497445252532,"rank":2018882,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":930379,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626012,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92455,"mean":7.0472400328813,"rank":48057,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":23791,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92455,"percentile":25},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64063,"mean":8.3162897193344,"rank":35564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":19384,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64063,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4025,"mean":9.7527723658052,"rank":2483,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":751,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4025,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
