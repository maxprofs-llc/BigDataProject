Here we introduce a genetically-encoded FRET sensor for pyruvate, and methods for quantitative measurement of pyruvate transport, pyruvate production and mitochondrial pyruvate consumption in intact individual cells at high temporal resolution. In HEK293 cells, neurons and astrocytes, mitochondrial pyruvate uptake was saturated at physiological levels, showing that the metabolic rate is determined by intrinsic properties of the organelle and not by substrate availability. The potential of the sensor was further demonstrated in neurons, where mitochondrial flux was found to rise by 300% within seconds of a calcium transient triggered by a short theta burst, while glucose levels remained unaltered. In contrast, astrocytic mitochondria were insensitive to a similar calcium transient elicited by extracellular ATP. We expect the improved resolution provided by the pyruvate sensor will be of practical interest for basic and applied researchers interested in mitochondrial function.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["San Mart\u00edn A","Ceballo S","Baeza-Lehnert F","Lerchundi R","Valdebenito R","Contreras-Baeza Y","Alegr\u00eda K","Barros LF"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0085780","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T21:08:32+00:00","issns":[""],"issue":"1","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1391335917,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24465702"],"pmcid":"PMC3897509","pmid":"24465702","pubdate":"2014-01-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Imaging Mitochondrial Flux in Single Cells with a FRET Sensor for Pyruvate.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/imaging-mitochondrial-flux-single-cells-fret-sensor-pyruvate"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3060518,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":939812,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107083,"mean":7.9444529239277,"rank":72669,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":22691,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107083,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80038,"mean":8.3626837087848,"rank":55935,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":15288,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80038,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4106,"mean":10.858856029233,"rank":3259,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":573,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4106,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":32,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
