The present study was aimed at clarifying the effect of PR on the type 2 diabetes mellitus. We employed Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats as a model of type-2 diabetes mellitus. OLETF rats were fed on either PR or white rice (WR) from the age of 4 to 35 wk. Age-matched male Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats as a non-diabetic control were also fed on WR. The HbA(1c) level in OLETF rats was significantly higher than that in LETO rats. However, the level was lower in PR-fed OLETF rats than in WR-fed OLETF rats. The plasma concentrations of TNF-\u03b1 and PAI-1 in OLETF rats were higher than those in LETO rats. However, both elevated levels were decreased by the PR-feeding, but not by the WR-feeding. On the other hand, the plasma adiponectin concentration in OLETF rats was lower than that in LETO rats. The decrease in adiponectin level of OLETF rats was ameliorated by PR-feeding. The size of adipocytes in PR-fed OLETF rats was smaller than that in WR-fed OLETF rats. In summary, intake of PR instead of WR ameliorates both insulin resistance and imbalance of the levels of plasma adipocytokines leading to diabetic complications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa67d3cf058f6100097fa","authors":["Torimitsu M","Nagase R","Yanagi M","Homma M","Sasai Y","Ito Y","Hayamizu K","Nonaka S","Hosono T","Kise M","Seki T","Ariga T"],"first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T20:39:56+00:00","issns":["0301-4800"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Nutritional Science & Vitaminology","last_mentioned_on":1392062793,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21228498"],"pmid":"21228498","pubdate":"2011-01-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Replacing white rice with pre-germinated brown rice mildly ameliorates hyperglycemia and imbalance of adipocytokine levels in type 2 diabetes model rats.","type":"article","volume":"56","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/replacing-white-rice-pregerminated-brown-rice-mildly-ameliorates-hyperglycemia-imbalance-adipocytoki"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3565818,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":137872,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107083,"mean":7.9350244298764,"rank":84163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":735,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107083,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":247,"mean":2.7993658536585,"rank":172,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":247,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":6.5333333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
