This article is a review of the studies on this topic published since 1970. All those studies that dealt with residents' moods and attitudes demonstrated deleterious effects of sleep deprivation and fatigue. The implications of this finding for patient care deserve exploration. Residents' acuity on performance tests requiring prolonged vigilance tended to deteriorate with acute sleep loss, while their performances on most brief psychomotor tests measuring manual dexterity, reaction times, and short-term recall were not adversely affected. The data presently available suggest that sleep-deprived or fatigued house officers can compensate for sleep loss in crises or other novel situations. However, sleep-deprived residents may be more prone to errors on routine, repetitive tasks and tasks that require sustained vigilance, which form a substantial portion of residents' workload. The authors concur with the recommendation of the Executive Council of the Association of American Medical Colleges that the total working hours for residents should not exceed 80 hours per week averaged over four weeks.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f6100056af","authors":["J S Samkoff","C H Jacques"],"first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T19:12:19+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1040-2446"],"issue":"11","journal":"Academic medicine","last_mentioned_on":1394815878,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1747181"],"pmid":"1747181","pubdate":"1991-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["education"],"title":"A review of studies concerning effects of sleep deprivation and fatigue on residents' performance.","type":"article","volume":"66","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/review-studies-concerning-effects-sleep-deprivation-fatigue-residents-performance"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3060744,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":940029,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107083,"mean":7.9441223361538,"rank":72757,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":22692,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107083,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1996,"mean":7.1069413533835,"rank":1674,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":164,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1996,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":11.49575,"rank":78,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":8}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
