The effects of male substances include the inhibition of subsequent female mating behavior, stimulation of oviposition and preoviposition behaviors, and the inhibition of host-seeking behavior. The circadian rhythmicity of females can also be altered and their metabolic priorities restructured, making them more likely to reproduce. The specific components that affect the female have yet to be completely identified, but the published reports are summarized.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6a03cf058f610009a0b","authors":["M J Klowden"],"first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T19:10:20+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["8756-971X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association","last_mentioned_on":1394881763,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10412116"],"pmid":"10412116","pubdate":"1999-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"The check is in the male: male mosquitoes affect female physiology and behavior.","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/check-male-male-mosquitoes-affect-female-physiology-behavior"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":2669399,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1696769,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123625,"mean":8.1517194234132,"rank":61599,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":45836,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123625,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185,"mean":4.5069891304348,"rank":113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":6.4375,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
