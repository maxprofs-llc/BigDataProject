[Subjects] Fifteen type 1 DM children (all boys; 13.0\u00b11.0\u2005years of age) were enrolled in the study. [Methods] The subjects received exercise training three times a week in a 12-week program. Each child was asked to walk on a treadmill to achieve an exercise intensity of VO2max 60%. ANS activity was measured by power spectral analysis of the electrocardiogram (ECG). Blood samples were obtained for serum lipid profiles. To evaluate Doppler-shifted Fourier pulsatility index (PI) analysis, a 5-MHz continuous wave Doppler (VASCULAB D10) set was used to measure forward blood flow velocity (FLOW) in the radial artery. [Results] Total and low-frequency (LF) power of heart rate variability increased significantly after exercise intervention. Total cholesterol (TC) levels were significant lower after exercise intervention. Total and high-frequency (HF) power were significantly correlated with higher TC levels, but diastolic blood pressure and HF was significantly correlated with lower TC levels. [Conclusion] Regular exercise intervention should be prescribed for children with type 1 DM.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a8f","authors":["Shin KO","Moritani T","Woo J","Jang KS","Bae JY","Yoo J","Kang S"],"doi":"10.1589\/jpts.26.111","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T19:34:52+00:00","issns":["0915-5287"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Physical Therapy Science","last_mentioned_on":1394044374,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24567687"],"pmid":"24567687","pubdate":"2014-02-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"title":"Exercise training improves cardiac autonomic nervous system activity in type 1 diabetic children.","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exercise-training-improves-cardiac-autonomic-nervous-system-activity-type-1-diabetic-children-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4738881,"mean":5.6916941821725,"rank":3359380,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":771085,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4738881,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113222,"mean":8.2058128439072,"rank":76512,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":20938,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113222,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":503,"mean":2.6976414342629,"rank":354,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":96,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":503,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":5.1862962962963,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
