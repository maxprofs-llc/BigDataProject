Although PC2 may contribute to Ca(2+) transport in human term placenta, the regulatory mechanisms associated with Ca(2+) handling in this tissue are largely unknown. In this work we assessed the regulation by Ca(2+) of PC2 channel function from a preparation of apical membranes of human syncytiotrophoblast (PC2hst) reconstituted in a lipid bilayer system. Addition of either EGTA or BAPTA to the cis hemi-chamber, representing the cytoplasmic domain of the channel, and lowering Ca(2+) to \u223c0.6-0.8 nM, inhibited spontaneous PC2hst channel activity, with a time response dependent on the chelator tested. EGTA reduced PC2hst channel currents by 86%, with a t1\/2 = 3.6 min, whereas BAPTA rapidly and completely (100%) eliminated channel activity with a t1\/2 = 0.8 min. Subsequent titration with Ca(2+) reversed the inhibition, which followed a Hill-type function with apparent dissociation constants of 1-5 nM, and 4 Ca(2+) binding sites. The degree of inhibition by the cis Ca(2+) chelator largely depended on increasing trans Ca(2+). This was consistent with measurable Ca(2+) transport through the channel, feeding the regulatory sites in the cytoplasmic domain. Interestingly, the reconstituted in vitro translated PC2 (PC2iv) was completely insensitive to Ca(2+) regulation, suggesting that the regulatory sites are not intrinsic to the channel protein. Our findings demonstrate the presence of a Ca(2+) microdomain largely accessible through the channel that controls PC2 function in human syncytiotrophoblast of term placenta.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c89","authors":["Cantero Mdel R","Cantiello HF"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bpj.2013.05.058","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T20:48:18+00:00","issns":["0006-3495"],"issue":"2","journal":"Biophysical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1391799813,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23870258"],"pmcid":"PMC3714927","pmid":"23870258","pubdate":"2013-07-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics"],"title":"Calcium Transport and Local Pool Regulate Polycystin-2 (TRPP2) Function in Human Syncytiotrophoblast.","type":"article","volume":"105","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/calcium-transport-local-pool-regulate-polycystin2-trpp2-function-human-syncytiotrophoblast"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3567692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":138128,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107083,"mean":7.944355335164,"rank":84392,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":779,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107083,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2060,"mean":2.7136522583779,"rank":1598,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2060,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":2.9691612903226,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
