Bayer. Staatssaml. Pal\u00e4ont. hist. Geol., 20, 51-77). He listed 34 continental gastropod species, which were neither figured nor properly described in many cases. Here a revision of his identifications is presented, with a full description of the material and illustration of the best preserved specimens. Following this revision, 20 species are listed for G\u00fcndlkofen. Unfortunately, part of the original material was missing and the record of a few species could not be confirmed. The depositional environment seems to have been a temporary water body, like an oxbow lake, surrounded by a humid and warm forest and scrubland.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008daf","authors":["RODRIGO B.
