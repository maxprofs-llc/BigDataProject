Here, we describe an outbreak caused by an ertapenem-resistant, CTX-M-15-producing clonal K. pneumoniae strain expressing an OmpK36 porin variant. From May 2012 to November 2012, 37 ertapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates phenotypically negative for carbapenemase production were recovered from 19 patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit of a Greek hospital. The isolates were either susceptible or intermediate to other carbapenems and resistant to all remaining \u03b2-lactams but cefotetan. Phenotypic and molecular analysis revealed the presence in all isolates of the blaCTX-M-15 gene on a conjugative 100-kb plasmid, disruption in the expression of the ompK35 gene, and the production of an Ompk36 porin variant. The index case was a patient admitted from another hospital. Active surveillance upon admission and on a weekly basis was immediately initiated; environmental samples were also periodically tested. Molecular typing showed that all clinical isolates as well as two ertapenem-resistant environmental K. pneumoniae isolates belonged to the same clonal type and were assigned to multilocus sequence typing (MLST) sequence type 101 (ST101). As all colonized\/infected patients were hospitalized during overlapping periods, cross-infection was considered the main route for the dissemination of the outbreak strain. Despite reinforcement of infection control measures and active surveillance, the outbreak lasted approximately 7 months. Identification of hidden carriers upon admission and by screening on a weekly basis was found valuable for early recognition and subsequent successful management of the outbreak.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be9","authors":["Aggeliki Poulou","Evangelia Voulgari","Georgia Vrioni","Vasiliki Koumaki","Grigorios Xidopoulos","Vasiliki Chatzipantazi","Fani Markou","Athanassios Tsakris"],"doi":"10.1128\/jcm.01244-13","first_seen_on":"2014-04-05T16:47:50+00:00","issns":["1098-660X"],"journal":"Journal of Clinical Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1396717397,"links":["http:\/\/jcm.asm.org\/content\/51\/10\/3176.short"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jcm.asm.org\/content\/51\/10\/3176.full.pdf","pmid":"23850951","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Outbreak Caused by an Ertapenem-Resistant, CTX-M-15-Producing Klebsiella pneumoniae Sequence Type 101 Clone Carrying an OmpK36 Porin Variant","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/outbreak-caused-ertapenemresistant-ctxm15producing-klebsiella-pneumoniae-sequence-type-101-clone-car"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":3554173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":836150,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123916,"mean":8.1054711536136,"rank":83074,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":22731,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123916,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3110,"mean":3.0784618848504,"rank":2272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":472,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3110,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":3.5102,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
