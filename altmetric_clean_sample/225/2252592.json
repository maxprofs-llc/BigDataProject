The embryonic hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs) from five pregnant rats in each group were collected on day 14 and cultured in vitro to determine the cell viability, apoptosis, and differentiation of NSCs using cell counting kit 8 assay, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence staining, respectively. In total, 20 male offspring on postnatal day 25 from each group were chosen to evaluate learning ability using a Morris water navigation task assay.Results:The data showed that prenatal exposure to BDE-209 decreased cell viability and differentiation of NSCs but promoted apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Prenatal BDE-209 exposure also impaired rat-learning acquisition in a dose-dependent manner.Conclusions:Prenatal BDE-209 exposure impairs rat-learning acquisition, possibly by affecting neurogenesis in the hippocampus during embryonic development.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002a05","authors":["Chen YH","Li ZH","Tan Y","Zhang CF","Chen JS","He F","Yu YH","Chen DJ"],"doi":"10.1177\/0960327113509661","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T19:56:12+00:00","issns":["0960-3271"],"issue":"","journal":"Human & Experimental Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1393432973,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24567298"],"pmid":"24567298","pubdate":"2014-02-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Prenatal exposure to decabrominated diphenyl ether impairs learning ability by altering neural stem cell viability, apoptosis, and differentiation in rat hippocampus.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prenatal-exposure-decabrominated-diphenyl-ether-impairs-learning-ability-altering-neural-stem-cell-v"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3567577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":138119,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107082,"mean":7.9445546642264,"rank":84401,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":779,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107082,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":325,"mean":6.6112222222222,"rank":247,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":325,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.5,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
