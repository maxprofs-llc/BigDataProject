Addressing these challenges requires an intervention that elicits motivation to engage in this activity, minimizes the direct relationship between unwanted internal experiences and inaction, and is also in itself accessible and convenient. Accordingly, this study investigated the efficacy of a self-managed Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) intervention delivered via DVD and tailored for physical activity initiation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002447","authors":["Moffitt, Robyn","Mohr, Philip","Robyn Moffitt","Philip Mohr"],"doi":"10.1111\/bjhp.12098","endpage":"129","first_seen_on":"2014-04-05T03:59:07+00:00","handle":"2440\/94965","handles":["2440\/94965"],"isbns":[],"issns":["2044-8287","1359-107X","1359107X"],"issue":"1","journal":"British Journal of Health Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1475600485,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/bjhp.12098\/abstract;jsessionid=1C97791D496A2BC4F6667E46F29259D7.f03t03","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/bjhp.12098\/abstract;jsessionid=3E6335D4317594DAFEF70882B8586B81.f02t01","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/bjhp.12098\/abstract;jsessionid=DA272FC0DE58E9F877607B0AD554896F.f01t04?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&userIsAuthenticated=false","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/bjhp.12098\/abstract;jsessionid=C3D4C9751E7D5438D5B3EF74F1989166.f03t01","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/bjhp.12098\/pdf","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/bjhp.12098\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/bjhp.12098\/abstract?hootPostID=02097f5f3363abcb78046c4dd4d52bd1","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1111\/bjhp.12098"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/bjhp.12098\/pdf","pmid":"24698135","pubdate":"2015-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Sociology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"115","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"The efficacy of a self\u2010managed Acceptance and Commitment Therapy intervention DVD for physical activity initiation","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/bjhp.12098","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/efficacy-selfmanaged-acceptance-commitment-therapy-intervention-dvd-physical-activity-initiation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":54.256,"score_history":{"1y":22.33,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":54.256},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8073544,"mean":6.8525437944593,"rank":160729,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":7912901,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8073544,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178210,"mean":7.4933578214346,"rank":4587,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":173623,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178210,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":415,"mean":10.622019323671,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":403,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":415,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":7.9083333333333,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":6,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Ph.
