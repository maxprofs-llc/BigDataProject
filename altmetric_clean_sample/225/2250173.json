How can we frame and report on telehealth studies? What are the health services elements to select based on the application needs? What are the appropriate terms to use to refer to such elements? Various frameworks have been proposed in the literature to answer these questions, and each framework is defined by a set of properties covering different aspects of telehealth systems. The most common properties include application, technology, and functionality. With the proliferation of telehealth, it is important not only to understand these properties, but also to define new properties to account for a wider range of context of use and evaluation outcomes. This article presents a comprehensive framework for delivery design, implementation, and evaluation of telehealth services. We first survey existing frameworks proposed in the literature and then present our proposed comprehensive multidimensional framework for telehealth. Six key dimensions of the proposed framework include health domains, health services, delivery technologies, communication infrastructure, environment setting, and socioeconomic analysis. We define a set of example properties for each dimension. We then demonstrate how we have used our framework to evaluate telehealth programs in rural and remote Australia. A few major international studies have been also mapped to demonstrate the feasibility of the framework. The key characteristics of the framework are as follows: (a) loosely coupled and hence easy to use, (b) provides a basis for describing a wide range of telehealth programs, and (c) extensible to future developments and needs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008aff","authors":["Nepal S","Li J","Jang-Jaccard J","Alem L","Surya Nepal","Jane Li","Julian Jang-Jaccard","Leila Alem","Nepal, Surya","Li, Jane","Jang-Jaccard, Julian","Alem, Leila"],"doi":"10.1089\/tmj.2013.0093","endpage":"404","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T19:09:14+00:00","issns":["1530-5627","1556-3669"],"issue":"4","journal":"Telemedicine Journal (now called Telemedicine Journal and e-Health)","last_mentioned_on":1397050306,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24621384","http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/pdfplus\/10.1089\/tmj.2013.0093"],"pmid":"24621384","pubdate":"2014-03-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Mary Ann Liebert Inc","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Library And Information Studies","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"393","subjects":["healthservices","medicalinformatics"],"title":"A Framework for Telehealth Program Evaluation.","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/framework-telehealth-program-evaluation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.55,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":804376,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":3699233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107082,"mean":7.9447059515697,"rank":22678,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":84262,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107082,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":618,"mean":3.5311507293355,"rank":110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":507,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":618,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":5.2422666666667,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
