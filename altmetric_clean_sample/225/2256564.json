In this report, we establish the utility of Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system for identifying the factors that contribute to bacterial persistence and for host control of gut luminal populations. We found that for N2 worms grown on mixed lawns of bacteria, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium substantially outcompeted Escherichia coli, even when E. coli was initially present at 100-fold-higher concentrations. To address whether innate immunity affects the competition, the daf-2 and daf-16 mutants were studied; their total gut bacterial levels reflect overall capacity for colonization, but Salmonella outcompeted E. coli to an extent similar to wild-type worms. To address the role of virulence properties, Salmonella \u0394spi-1 \u0394spi-2 was used to compete with E. coli. The net differential was significantly less than that for wild-type Salmonella; thus, spi-1 spi-2 encodes C. elegans colonization factors. An E. coli strain with repeated in vivo passage had an enhanced ability to compete against an in vitro-passed E. coli strain and against Salmonella. Our data provide evidence of active competition for colonization niches in the C. elegans gut, as determined by bacterial factors and subject to in vivo selection.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f610007771","authors":["Portal-Celhay C","Blaser MJ"],"doi":"10.1128\/iai.05522-11","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T21:09:23+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["0019-9567"],"issue":"","journal":"Infection and Immunity","last_mentioned_on":1391346623,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/22184417\/"],"pmid":"22184417","pubdate":"2011-12-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["communicablediseases","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Competition and resilience between founder and introduced bacteria in the Caenorhabditis elegans gut.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/competition-resilience-between-founder-introduced-bacteria-caenorhabditis-elegans-gut"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628496,"mean":4.94108381299,"rank":2017247,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":936091,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628496,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92681,"mean":7.0532371385414,"rank":48087,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":23973,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92681,"percentile":25},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1725,"mean":3.1933758700696,"rank":824,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":502,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1725,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":1.2722777777778,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":26,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
