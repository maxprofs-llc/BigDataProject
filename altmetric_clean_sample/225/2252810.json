(Asteraceae) growing in Iran were obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC and GC\/MS. The oil of flower was characterized by higher amount of limonene (21.2%), alpha-cadinol (18.2%), borneol (11.9%), delta-cadinene (9.0%), bornyl acetate (8.0%) and alpha-humulene (7.3%). Twenty one constituents representing 96.2% of the chromatographical leaf oil were identified of which limonene (29.2%), alpha-pinene (14.4%), caryophyllene oxide (6.5%), alpha-gurjunene (6.3%), bornyl acetate (5.5%) and torreyol (5.2%) were the major components. The main components of the stem oil were limonene (23.6%), alpha-pinene (13.4%), spathulenol (6.4%), alpha-gurjunene (6.3%), caryophyllene oxide (5.3%), bornyl acetate (5.2%), beta-cubebene (4.8%) and delta-cadinene (4.3%). The composition of the oils is different, although the most abundant components are identical in leaf oil (96.2%). The antimicrobial effect of flower, leaf and stem essential oils from Helichrysum armenium was studied according to the agar diffusion cup method. The essential oils had a moderate effect on the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and had a substantial fungicidal effect on the fungi under study.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9283cf058f61000dd23","authors":["Oji KA","Shafaghat A"],"first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T20:00:37+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"5","journal":"Natural product communications","last_mentioned_on":1393319944,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22799105"],"pmid":"22799105","pubdate":"2012-07-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","botany","pharmacology"],"title":"Constituents and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils from flower, leaf and stem of Helichrysum armenium.","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/constituents-antimicrobial-activity-essential-oils-flower-leaf-stem-helichrysum-armenium"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627387,"mean":4.9489064262842,"rank":2018345,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":932477,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627387,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92573,"mean":7.0486223912199,"rank":48086,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":23866,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92573,"percentile":25},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207,"mean":1.9933689320388,"rank":54,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":98,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":0.92083333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
