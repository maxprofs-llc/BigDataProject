Taking lateral skid into account, this paper presents a rough terrain model and nonholonomic kinematics model for planetary rovers. An approach is proposed in which the reference path is generated according to the planned path by combining look-ahead distance and path updating distance on the basis of the carrot following method. A path-following strategy for wheeled planetary exploration robots incorporating slip compensation is designed. Simulation results of a four-wheeled robot on deformable rough terrain verify that it can be controlled to follow a planned path with good precision, despite the fact that the wheels will obviously skid and slip.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f6100088c9","authors":["Ding, Liang"],"doi":"10.1155\/2014\/793526","first_seen_on":"2014-04-05T16:58:52+00:00","issns":["","2356-6140"],"journal":"The Scientific World Journal","last_mentioned_on":1396728959,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/tswj\/2014\/793526\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/tswj\/2014\/793526.pdf","pmid":"24790582","pubdate":"2014-03-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Path-Following Control of Wheeled Planetary Exploration Robots Moving on Deformable Rough Terrain","type":"article","volume":"2014","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pathfollowing-control-wheeled-planetary-exploration-robots-moving-deformable-rough-terrain"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8251482,"mean":6.9709860004461,"rank":3533340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4682096,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8251482,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178943,"mean":7.5595194308773,"rank":61945,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":116025,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178943,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1591,"mean":2.7078943396226,"rank":425,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":1161,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1591,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99,"mean":1.6934081632653,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":83,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GW":1,"GB":1,"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BeyondMatter\/status\/452490407033597952","license":"public","citation_ids":[2258074],"posted_on":"2014-04-05T16:58:14+00:00","author":{"name":"Beyond The Matter","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/641227217511542785\/p1ZvPptS_normal.jpg","description":"Curiosity is the ego of the Universe, by contemplating itself ...
