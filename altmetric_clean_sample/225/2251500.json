Here we used mass spectrometry analysis of hydrogen-deuterium exchange to examine brain-derived PrP(Sc). Our data indicate that, contrary to popular models, prion-protein conversion involves refolding of the entire region from residue ~80-90 to the C-terminus, which in PrP(Sc) consists of \u03b2-strands and relatively short turns and\/or loops, with no native \u03b1-helices present.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f61000316f","authors":["Vytautas Smirnovas","Gerald S.
