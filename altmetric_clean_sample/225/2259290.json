The study was conducted in two phases. In phase I, 12 patients with active RA SSII and 12 with active RA non-SSII were consecutively enrolled. Each completed an Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire and underwent a full eye exam and in\u00a0vivo confocal microscopy examination of the cornea. Tear fluid samples were collected in sponges and analyzed for IL-1\u03b1, -6, and -8, and TNF-\u03b1. When RA activity was suppressed by systemic treatment the patients entered phase II of the study in which all of the phase I examinations were repeated. In RA SSII patients, OSDI, fluorescein staining dendritic cell density, and concentrations of IL-1\u03b1 and IL-6 decreased significantly (P\u2009<\u20090.01) between phases I and II. Tear breakup time scores increased significantly. For RA non-SSII patients, there were no significant differences between phases I and II. Differences in the clinical, cellular and cytokine responsiveness to systemic RA treatments show that the ocular surface pathology is dissimilar for RA SSII and RA non-SSII patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d79","authors":["Villani E","Galimberti D","Del Papa N","Nucci P","Ratiglia R"],"doi":"10.1177\/1753425912471692","first_seen_on":"2014-04-06T13:37:48+00:00","issns":["1753-4259"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Endotoxin Research","last_mentioned_on":1396942970,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23339928"],"pmid":"23339928","pubdate":"2013-01-25T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["bacteriology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Inflammation in dry eye associated with rheumatoid arthritis: Cytokine and in vivo confocal microscopy study.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inflammation-dry-eye-associated-rheumatoid-arthritis-cytokine-iinvivoi-confocal-microscopy-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5485384,"mean":6.3704076287846,"rank":2506532,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2951796,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5485384,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132900,"mean":8.1659407820979,"rank":55320,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":76782,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132900,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192,"mean":1.0413507853403,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":161,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.0090909090909,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"NL":1,"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SjogrensForum\/status\/452923386868420609","license":"public","rt":["SjogrensCa"],"citation_ids":[2259290],"posted_on":"2014-04-06T21:38:45+00:00","author":{"name":"Sj\u00f6grens Forum","url":"http:\/\/www.sjogrensforum.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1083947731\/birds_normal.jpg","description":"Living Well With Sj\u00f6gren's Syndrome.","id_on_source":"SjogrensForum","tweeter_id":"169679081","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":3089},"tweet_id":"452923386868420609"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SjogrenSyndroom\/status\/453437798251778048","license":"datasift","rt":["SjogrensCa"],"citation_ids":[2259290],"posted_on":"2014-04-08T07:42:50+00:00","author":{"name":"Syndroom van Sj\u00f6gren","url":"http:\/\/www.nvsp.nl","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2520348561\/zd86ibynoene96iy8hzp_normal.jpeg","description":"Sj\u00f6gren is een chronische ontsteking van de traan- en speekselklieren.
