There is specific evidence that insulin may work to stimulate osteoblast differentiation, which in turn would enhance production of osteocalcin, the osteoblast-produced peptide that can stimulate pancreatic \u03b2 cell proliferation and skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity. It is uncertain whether insulin stimulates bone directly or indirectly by increasing muscle work and therefore skeletal loading. We raise the question of the sequence of events that occurs with insulin resistance, such as type 2 diabetes. Evidence to date suggests that these patients have lower serum concentrations of osteocalcin, perhaps reduced skeletal loading, and reduced bone strength as evidenced by micro-indentation studies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc8f","authors":["Klein GL","Gordon L Klein"],"doi":"10.4239\/wjd.v5.i1.14","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T19:40:54+00:00","issns":["","1948-9358"],"issue":"1","journal":"World Journal of Diabetes","last_mentioned_on":1504710048,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24567798","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3932424\/"],"pmid":"24567798","pubdate":"2014-02-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Baishideng Publishing Group Inc","startpage":"14","title":"Insulin and bone: Recent developments.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/insulin-bone-recent-developments"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8373007,"mean":7.0576589951014,"rank":3972909,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4214415,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8373007,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179171,"mean":7.6068974828378,"rank":72396,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":101317,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179171,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207,"mean":4.0582912621359,"rank":96,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":6.5,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
