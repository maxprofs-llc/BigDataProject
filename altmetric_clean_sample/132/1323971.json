It was found that chicken Lpin1-\u03b1 and Lpin1-\u03b2 exhibited distinct tissue expression profiling, with prominent expression in the ovary and muscle tissues respectively. Chicken Lpin1 presented a tissue-specific temporal expression pattern in postnatal development (0-16 weeks). Energy restriction significantly elevated the mRNA level of total Lpin1 by increasing the expression of Lpin1-\u03b1 and Lpin1-\u03b2 in a nearly same magnitude. Eight variants\/four haplotypes among six breeds were detected from the 5' flanking region of chicken Lpin1, one multiple-nucleotide length polymorphism (g.258M>N) was found and predicted causing the change of 31 transcription factor binding sites including MyoD et al. Both g.258M>N and g. 65C>T variants showed significant association with muscle fiber traits, which suggested one novel role of Lpin1 on muscle fiber development.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002932","authors":["Li S","Chen W","Kang X","Han R","Sun G","Huang Y"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.gene.2012.11.075","first_seen_on":"2013-03-27T10:11:44+00:00","issns":["0378-1119"],"issue":"","journal":"Gene","last_mentioned_on":1364378981,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23266642?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23266642","pubdate":"2012-12-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Distinct tissue expression profiles of chicken Lpin1-\u03b1\/\u03b2 isoforms and the effect of the variation on muscle fiber traits.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/distinct-tissue-expression-profiles-chicken-lpin1-isoforms-effect-variation-muscle-fiber-traits"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627536,"mean":4.9480380313392,"rank":2906050,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":74300,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627536,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85651,"mean":6.3794284413311,"rank":66015,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85651,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3486,"mean":2.3524631276901,"rank":2746,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3486,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":0.99589655172414,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"MX":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/libroazuln\/statuses\/316854532019728384","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1323971],"posted_on":"2013-03-27T10:09:41+00:00","author":{"name":"Libro Azul","url":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Libro-Azul\/279667772085894?sk=app_190322544333196","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1733482297\/Bright_512x512_normal.png","description":"La desnutrici\u00f3n es un factor que se asocia con mal pron\u00f3stico en pacientes hospitalizados y ambulatorios","id_on_source":"libroazuln","tweeter_id":"454601506","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":161},"tweet_id":"316854532019728384"}]}}
