Other smoking phenotypes have been tested, but the results are less consistent. The tendency to relapse versus the ability to maintain long-term abstinence has received little attention in genetic studies; thus, our aim was to provide a better biological understanding of this phenotype through the identification of genetic loci associated with smoking relapse.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f610008656","authors":["Tozzi F","Teumer A","Munaf\u00f2 M","Rawal R","Kazeem G","Gerbaulet M","McArdle W","Chilcoat H","D\u00f6ring A","Dahmen N","Mooser V","Nauck M","Ring SM","Rubio JP","Vollenweider P","Waeber G","John U","V\u00f6lzke H","Homuth G","Freyberger HJ","V\u00f6lker U","Davey-Smith G","Gieger C","Preisig M","Grabe HJ","Federica Tozzi","Alexander Teumer","Marcus Munaf\u00f2","Rajesh Rawal","Gbenga Kazeem","Marcel Gerbaulet","Wendy McArdle","Howard Chilcoat","Angela D\u00f6ring","Norbert Dahmen","Vincent Mooser","Matthias Nauck","Susan M Ring","Justin P.
