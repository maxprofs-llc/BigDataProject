To date, several antipoliovirus (PV) compounds similar to enviroxime that are associated with a common resistance mutation in viral protein 3A (a G5318A [3A-Ala70Thr] mutation in PV) have been identified. Most of these compounds have a direct inhibitory effect on PI4KB activity, as well as enviroxime (designated major enviroxime-like compounds). However, one of the compounds, AN-12-H5, showed no inhibitory effect on PI4KB and was considered to belong to another group of enviroxime-like compounds (designated minor enviroxime-like compounds). In the present study, we performed a small interfering RNA (siRNA) sensitization assay targeting PI4KB-related genes and identified oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) as a target of minor enviroxime-like compounds. Knockdown of OSBP and OSBP2 increased the anti-PV activities of AN-12-H5 and a newly identified minor enviroxime-like compound, T-00127-HEV2, and also to T-00127-HEV1 to a minor extent, in the cells. A ligand of OSBP, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC), acted as a minor enviroxime-like compound. Minor enviroxime-like compounds induced relocalization of OSBP to the Golgi apparatus in cells. Treatment of the cells with major or minor enviroxime-like compounds suppressed the expression of genes (HMGCS1 and SQLE) in the SREBP\/SCAP regulatory pathway and diminished endogenous phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) at the Golgi apparatus. Our results suggested that minor enviroxime-like compounds are phenotypically identical to 25-HC and that major and minor enviroxime-like compounds suppress the production and\/or accumulation of PI4P in PV-infected cells by targeting PI4KB and OSBP family I activities, respectively.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f92","authors":["Minetaro Arita","Hirotatsu Kojima","Tetsuo Nagano","Takayoshi Okabe","Takaji Wakita","Hiroyuki Shimizu"],"doi":"10.1128\/jvi.03546-12","first_seen_on":"2013-03-25T15:44:59+00:00","issns":["1098-5514"],"journal":"Journal of Virology","last_mentioned_on":1364226190,"links":["http:\/\/jvi.asm.org\/content\/87\/8\/4252.short?rss=1&buffer_share=47d7e"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jvi.asm.org\/content\/87\/8\/4252.full.pdf","pmid":"23365445","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Oxysterol-Binding Protein Family I Is the Target of Minor Enviroxime-Like Compounds","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/oxysterolbinding-protein-family-i-target-minor-enviroximelike-compounds"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":3078395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":957851,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89314,"mean":6.61303507888,"rank":60188,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":19137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89314,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5119,"mean":3.0826975381008,"rank":3577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1146,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5119,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":3.6876333333333,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
