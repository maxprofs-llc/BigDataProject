Both a precursor of dopamine (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine: DOPA) and a precursor of octopamine (tyramine) in the brain decreased in an age-dependent fashion before sexual maturation (i.e. 8days of age), whereas the levels of brain dopamine, dopamine metabolites (N-acetyldopamine and norepinephrine) and octopamine were increased. These age-dependent increases of dopamine and octopamine were also detected in the meso-metathoracic ganglia. Injection of either dopamine or octopamine into 7-8-day-old males shortened the duration for flight-initiation and increased the duration of wing vibration, indicating that both dopamine and octopamine enhance the flight-initiation and -sustaining activities in males. Applications of a juvenile hormone analog (methoprene) enhanced the levels of dopamine in the brains of 4-day-old males, but this enhancement was not detected in either brain octopamine or meso-metathoracic dopamine and octopamine. Thus, we found that both dopamine and octopamine in the brain and meso-metathoracic ganglia increase until sexual maturation and could enhance the activities of mating flight independently; in addition, the increase in levels of dopamine in the brain could be selectively regulated by juvenile hormone. The regulatory systems of dopamine and octopamine in honey bee males might be 'classical' and similar to those of primitively eusocial hymenopterans, and partly adapt to the short lifespan with a single mating system in the males.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002936","doi":"10.1016\/j.ygcen.2013.02.039","first_seen_on":"2013-03-26T00:25:43+00:00","issns":["1095-6840"],"journal":"General & Comparative Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1363897105,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23510859?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23510859","pubdate":"2013-03-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Neuroendocrine mechanisms underlying regulation of mating flight behaviors in male honey bees (Apis mellifera L.).","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neuroendocrine-mechanisms-underlying-regulation-mating-flight-behaviors-male-honey-bees-apis-mellife"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628445,"mean":4.9414395978041,"rank":2903604,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75996,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628445,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85557,"mean":6.3778772499884,"rank":65853,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":276,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85557,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":380,"mean":1.6065963060686,"rank":225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":380,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":2.695,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
