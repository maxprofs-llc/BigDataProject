Electromechanical wave imaging (EWI) is an ultrasound-based method that has previously been shown to be capable of noninvasively and transmurally mapping the activation sequence of the heart in animal studies by estimating and imaging the electromechanical wave, that is, the transient strains occurring in response to the electrical activation, at both high temporal and spatial resolutions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61a3cf058f610007602","authors":["Provost J","Gambhir A","Vest J","Garan H","Konofagou EE"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.hrthm.2013.02.028","first_seen_on":"2013-03-29T21:07:58+00:00","funders":["nhlbi"],"issns":["1547-5271"],"issue":"","journal":"Heart Rhythm","last_mentioned_on":1364565346,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23454060"],"pmid":"23454060","pubdate":"2013-03-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"A Clinical Feasibility Study of Atrial and Ventricular Electromechanical Wave Imaging.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-feasibility-study-atrial-ventricular-electromechanical-wave-imaging-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627916,"mean":4.9454584244709,"rank":2017872,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":933910,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627916,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85554,"mean":6.3975392096128,"rank":43581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":26677,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85554,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":390,"mean":4.4761079691517,"rank":191,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":72,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":390,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":5.3316,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
