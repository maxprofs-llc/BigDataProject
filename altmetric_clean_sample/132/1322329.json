In developing countries, increased resistance to antibiotics and its cost make eradication more difficult. Probiotics can reduce adverse effects and improve the infection treatment efficacy.If the first-line therapy fails a second-line treatment using tetracycline, furazolidone and proton-pump inhibitors has been effective and low cost in Brazil; however it implies in a lot of adverse effects. The aim of this study was to minimize the adverse effects and increase the eradication rate applying the association of a probiotic compound to second-line therapy regimen.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b7","doi":"10.1186\/1471-230x-13-56","first_seen_on":"2013-03-26T15:05:49+00:00","issns":["1471-230X"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Gastroenterology","last_mentioned_on":1364421130,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-230X\/13\/56\/abstract"],"pmid":"23530767","pubdate":"2013-03-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Gastroenterology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"56","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Association of a probiotic to a Helicobacter pylori eradication regimen does not increase efficacy or decreases the adverse effects of the treatment: a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-probiotic-helicobacter-pylori-eradication-regimen-not-increase-efficacy-decreases-advers-6"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6228821,"mean":5.9651376482241,"rank":2294667,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":3843440,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6228821,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98462,"mean":6.8658039223652,"rank":34925,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":61606,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98462,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":645,"mean":3.3171801242236,"rank":205,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":418,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":645,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":7.5558571428571,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"CA":1},"mendeley":{"CO":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/LoveThatBug\/statuses\/316566186852761600","license":"public","citation_ids":[1322329],"posted_on":"2013-03-26T15:03:55+00:00","author":{"name":"Dawn Rotarangi","url":"http:\/\/www.probiotics-lovethatbug.com","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/959085524\/friendly-probiotic-bacteria_normal.jpg","description":"Lover of probiotics, fermented foods and all things buggy!\r\nAuthor. \r\nFollow back.","id_on_source":"LoveThatBug","tweeter_id":"110322196","geo":{"lt":"54.7023545","ln":"-3.2765753","country":"GB"},"followers":7160},"tweet_id":"316566186852761600"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bykriscampbell\/status\/317031316757544960","license":"public","citation_ids":[1322329],"posted_on":"2013-03-27T21:52:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Kristina Campbell","url":"https:\/\/www.bykriscampbell.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/777921297892282368\/zbetiUrc_normal.jpg","description":"I talk to scientists and write about the #microbiome & #diet & #health.
