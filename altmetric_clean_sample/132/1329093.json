PM"],"citation":{"abstract":"Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive lymphoma subtype with dismal prognosis. New treatments are needed to improve outcome of relapsed\/ refractory disease. Recently, several drugs targeting at least partially the process of angiogenesis have been successfully tested in the therapy of MCL. Molecular mechanisms that regulate MCL-induced angiogenesis and that might represent potential new druggable targets remain, however, incompletely understood. We established two mouse models of human MCL by subcutaneous xenotransplantation of JEKO-1 and HBL-2 cell lines into immunodeficient mice. Histological analyses of xenografts confirmed their neovascularization. The growth of xenografts was significantly suppressed by single-agent therapy with bevacizumab, monoclonal antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Subsequently, we analysed expression of 94 angiogenesis related genes in ex vivo isolated JEKO-1 and HBL-2 cells compared to in vitro growing cells using TaqMan low-density arrays. The most up-regulated genes in both JEKO-1 and HBL-2 xenografts were genes encoding platelet\/endothelial cell-adhesion molecule (CD31\/PECAM1), VEGF receptor 1 (FLT1), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), angiogenin (ANG) and transcription factor PROX1. The most downregulated genes in both JEKO-1 and HBL-2 xenografts were midkine (MDK) and ephrine B2 (EPHB2). In summary, our results demonstrate an important role of angiogenesis in the biology of MCL and provide preclinical evidence of potent anti-MCL activity of bevacizumab. In addition, gene expression profiling of 94 angiogenesis-related targets revealed several in vivo up-regulated and down-regulated transcripts. The most differentially expressed target in both MCL tumours was CD31\/PECAM1. Whether any of these molecules might represent a potential druggable target in MCL patients remains to be elucidated.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6183cf058f610007450","first_seen_on":"2013-03-30T11:01:59+00:00","issns":["0015-5500"],"issue":"1","journal":"Folia Biologica","last_mentioned_on":1364641184,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23537525?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23537525","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"In Vivo Growth of Mantle Cell Lymphoma Xenografts in Immunodeficient Mice Is Positively Regulated by VEGF and Associated with Significant Up-regulation of CD31\/PECAM1.","type":"article","volume":"59","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vivo-growth-mantle-cell-lymphoma-xenografts-immunodeficient-mice-positively-regulated-vegf-associate"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":4203486,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93962,"mean":6.8132384925662,"rank":76631,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93962,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":1.7904390243902,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
