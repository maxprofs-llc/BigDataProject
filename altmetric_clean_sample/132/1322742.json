Developed since 1996, CoCoMac comprises approximately 40,000 experimental findings on anatomical connections in the macaque brain, as derived from neuroanatomical tract tracing studies. In this historical review, I describe the origin and the history of CoCoMac from a personal perspective, illustrate the principles of its structure and outline the impact it has had on systems neuroscience, in particular as a prelude to the \"Human Connectome\" research programme.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f610003196","doi":"10.1016\/j.neuroimage.2013.03.016","first_seen_on":"2013-03-26T17:50:12+00:00","funders":["wellcome"],"issns":["1095-9572"],"journal":"NeuroImage","last_mentioned_on":1365104289,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23523808?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23523808","pubdate":"2013-03-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["diagnosticimaging"],"title":"The history of CoCoMac.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/history-cocomac"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.45,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":941105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":3560509,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89386,"mean":6.6295181518153,"rank":21582,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":67614,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89386,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3747,"mean":5.5216636412173,"rank":1233,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2502,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3747,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170,"mean":6.005124260355,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":13,"Researcher":35,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
