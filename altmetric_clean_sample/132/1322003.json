By using a microRNA microarray approach, we have identified that miRNA-32-5p expression is significantly reduced under hyperglycemic conditions in rat bone marrow-derived MSCs. Expression of miRNA-32-5p targets the 3'-untranslated region of the mRNA encoding phosphatase and tensin homologs deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), a negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)\/Akt signaling pathway. Exposure to high glucose levels reduced miR-32-5p expression, induced PTEN expression, and inhibited activation of the PI3K\/Akt signaling pathway of MSCs. Conversely, overexpression of miR-32-5p inhibited the expression of PTEN, ameliorated the inhibitory effect of high glucose levels on the PI3K\/Akt signaling pathway, and promoted cell cycle progression from G0\/G1 to G2\/M and S phases. Our study indicates that exposure of MSCs to hyperglycemic conditions reduces miR-32-5p expression and disturbs cell cycle progression through a PTEN-mediated inhibitory effect on the PI3K\/Akt signaling pathway. In summary, MiR-32-5p is a potentially important therapeutic agent for preventing MSC dysfunction under hyperglycemic conditions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","authors":["Guiying Zhu","Jiake Chai","Li Ma","Hongjie Duan","Haijun Zhang"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbrc.2013.03.018","first_seen_on":"2013-03-26T12:42:56+00:00","issns":["0006291X"],"journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1364301659,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0006291X13004312"],"pmid":"23524257","pubdate":"2013-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Downregulated microRNA-32 expression induced by high glucose inhibits cell cycle progression via PTEN upregulation and Akt inactivation in bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/downregulated-microrna32-expression-induced-high-glucose-inhibits-cell-cycle-progression-via-pten-up"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5028115,"mean":5.9640561526634,"rank":3320189,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1499101,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5028115,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93680,"mean":6.7968800691725,"rank":57781,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":31451,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93680,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6940,"mean":2.474298602104,"rank":5362,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":1432,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6940,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77,"mean":1.1766315789474,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
