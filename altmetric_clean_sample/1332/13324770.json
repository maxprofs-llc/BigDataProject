How these very diverse functions are regulated remains unknown. This study, using the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, showed that a subset of CD169(+) macrophages in murine spleen and lymph nodes produced high amounts of IFN-I upon infection. Absence of CD169(+) macrophages led to insufficient production of IFN-I, lower antiviral activity and persistence of virus. Lack of CD169(+) macrophages also limited the IFN-I-dependent expression of PD-L1. Enhanced viral replication in the absence of PD-L1 led to persistence of virus and prevented CD8(+) T-cell exhaustion. As a consequence, mice exhibited severe immunopathology and died quickly after infection. Therefore, CD169(+) macrophages are important contributors to the IFN-I response and thereby influence antiviral activity, CD8(+) T-cell exhaustion and immunopathology.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e18","authors":["Namir Shaabani","Vikas Duhan","Vishal Khairnar","Asmae Gassa","Rita Ferrer-Tur","Dieter H\u00e4ussinger","Mike Recher","Gennadiy Zelinskyy","Jia Liu","Ulf Dittmer","Mirko Trilling","Stefanie Scheu","Cornelia Hardt","Philipp A Lang","Nadine Honke","Karl S Lang"],"doi":"10.1038\/cddis.2016.350","first_seen_on":"2016-11-04T03:37:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["false","2041-4889"],"issue":"11","journal":"Cell Death & Disease","last_mentioned_on":1504004172,"links":["http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/cddis\/rss\/current\/~3\/PWJcXQrSOdQ\/cddis.2016.350","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27809306?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27809306","pubdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","startpage":"e2446","subjects":["cellbiology","internalmedicine"],"title":"CD169+ macrophages regulate PD-L1 expression via type I interferon and thereby prevent severe immunopathology after LCMV infection","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cd169-macrophages-regulate-pdl1-expression-via-type-i-interferon-thereby-prevent-severe-immunopathol"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.25,"score_history":{"1y":9.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":958498,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7475277,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245545,"mean":13.08143698889,"rank":43767,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":201024,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245545,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1580,"mean":5.4943242558581,"rank":402,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":1073,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1580,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82,"mean":7.4907407407407,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":44,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
