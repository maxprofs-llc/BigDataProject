In an attempt to describe the nature of ageing in diverse organisms, the intimate links between the origins of life and ageing are examined. Departing from Leslie Orgel's initial ideas on why organisms age, it is then discussed how the potentially detrimental events characteristic of ageing are continuous, cell-autonomous and universal to all organisms. The manifestation of these alterations relies on the balance between their production and cellular renewal. Renewal is achieved not only by repair and maintenance mechanisms but, importantly, by the process of cell division such that every time cells divide ageing-associated effects are diluted.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f6100021a8","authors":["Antonio Currais","Currais, Antonio"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.arr.2016.10.007","first_seen_on":"2016-11-03T22:28:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["15681637","1872-9649"],"journal":"Ageing Research Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1491750444,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S1568163716302288&_version=1&md5=998c6fd766ca4cd468afcc8ce0e96e69","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1568163716302288"],"pmid":"27818249","pubdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"The Origin of Life at the Origin of Ageing?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/origin-life-origin-ageing"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":2.25,"6m":0.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8233879,"mean":6.9714785601567,"rank":3462838,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4719476,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8233879,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242432,"mean":13.008777186086,"rank":97923,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":142296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242432,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":465,"mean":8.7963189655172,"rank":264,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":197,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":465,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":15.876222222222,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Business, Management and Accounting":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/humanageing\/statuses\/794300140722929664","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13320354],"posted_on":"2016-11-03T22:08:05+00:00","author":{"name":"TheHumanAgingProject","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/514754202417901569\/7H27ZBby_normal.jpeg","description":"Streaming freshly published papers about aging from all important journals.
