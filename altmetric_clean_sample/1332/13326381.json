For each area, six EM chief residents identify 3-5 advanced clinical questions. Using FOAMsearch.net to search blogs and podcasts, relevant posts are scored by eight reviewers from the AIR-Pro Board, which is comprised of EM faculty and chief residents at various institutions. The scoring instrument contains five measurement outcomes based on 7-point Likert scales: recency, accuracy, educational utility, evidence based, and references. The AIR-Pro label is awarded to posts with a score of \u226526 (out of 35) points. An \"Honorable Mention\" label is awarded if Board members collectively felt that the posts were valuable and the scores were > 20.\nWe included a total of 41 blog posts and podcasts. Key educational pearls from the 10 high quality AIR-Pro posts and four Honorable Mentions are summarized.\nThe WestJEM ALiEM Blog and Podcast Watch series is based on the AIR and AIR-Pro series, which attempts to identify high quality educational content on open-access blogs and podcasts. Until more objective quality indicators are developed for learners and educators, this series provides an expert-based, crowdsourced approach towards critically appraising educational social media content for EM clinicians.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008cc9","authors":["Zaver, Fareen","Hansen, Michael","Leibner, Evan","Little, Andrew","Lin, Michelle","Fareen Zaver","Michael Hansen","Evan Leibner","Andrew Little","Michelle Lin"],"doi":"10.5811\/westjem.2016.6.30193","endpage":"518","first_seen_on":"2016-11-04T06:56:29+00:00","issns":["1936-9018","1936900X","19369018"],"issue":"5","journal":"The Western Journal of Emergency Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1481189643,"links":["http:\/\/westjem.com\/articles\/blog-and-podcast-watch-pediatric-emergency-medicine.html","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5017833\/"],"pmid":"27625713","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"California Chapter of the American Academy of Emergency Medicine (Cal\/AAEM)","startpage":"513","title":"Blog and Podcast Watch: Pediatric Emergency Medicine.","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/blog-podcast-watch-pediatric-emergency-medicine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":2.1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7861897,"mean":6.6582651640212,"rank":3305958,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4521693,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7861897,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236638,"mean":12.890133994261,"rank":97409,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":137448,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236638,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":676,"mean":7.8634192592593,"rank":378,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":293,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":676,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":7.8445833333333,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
