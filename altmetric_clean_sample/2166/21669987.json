However, current standard techniques rely on cell labeling, a process which imposes significant limitations. Here we present three-dimensional (3D) optical measurements and the label-free characterization of mouse WBCs using optical diffraction tomography. 3D refractive index (RI) tomograms of individual WBCs are constructed from multiple two-dimensional quantitative phase images of samples illuminated at various angles of incidence. Measurements of the 3D RI tomogram of WBCs enable the separation of heterogeneous populations of WBCs using quantitative morphological and biochemical information. Time-lapse tomographic measurements also provide the 3D trajectory of micrometer-sized beads ingested by WBCs. These results demonstrate that optical diffraction tomography can be a useful and versatile tool for the study of WBCs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c7b","authors":["Chulhee Choi","HyunJoo Park","Jonghee Yoon","Kyoohyun Kim","Seongsoo Jang","YongKeun Park","Jonghee Yoon","Kyoohyun Kim","HyunJoo Park","Chulhee Choi","Seongsoo Jang","YongKeun Park"],"doi":"10.1364\/boe.6.003865","first_seen_on":"2017-07-09T04:30:17+00:00","issns":["2156-7085"],"issue":"10","journal":"Biomedical Optics Express","last_mentioned_on":1497477697,"links":["https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1364\/BOE.6.003865"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.osapublishing.org\/viewmedia.cfm?uri=boe-6-10-3865&seq=0","pmid":"26504637","pubdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Optical Society of America","title":"Label-free characterization of white blood cells by measuring 3D refractive index maps","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/labelfree-characterization-white-blood-cells-measuring-3d-refractive-index-maps"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366012,"mean":7.0543497525808,"rank":7232096,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366012,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228570,"mean":12.782993555556,"rank":187689,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228570,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":585,"mean":9.6224726027397,"rank":376,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":585,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":4.5376666666667,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
