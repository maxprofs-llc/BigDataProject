This retrospective, comparative case series study aimed to analyze the rotational deviation, or cyclotorsion, of three corneal marking methods: VERION digital marker (VDM; reference), horizontal slit beam marking (HSBM), and subjective direct visual marking (SDVM) on the table (using a bevel knife tip). Subjects included 81 eyes of 61 patients (mean age: 65.70\u00b113.14 years; range: 32-91 years) undergoing scheduled cataract surgery. A preoperative reference image was taken of each eye. Subsequently, a slit lamp with the light beam turned to the horizontal meridian was used to align the seated patient's head, and two reference marks were placed at the 3- and 9-o'clock positions of the corneal limbus using a 27-gauge needle and marking pen (HSBM). Upon transfer to the surgical table, the VDM was used to display a real-time dial scale on the patient's eye, with the entrance of the temporal clear corneal incision (CCI) at 0\u00b0 (horizontal meridian). Simultaneously, a bevel knife tip was used to create a marker based on the surgeon's visual determination of the temporal 0\u00b0 point (SDVM). We used the VDM to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of axis alignment via deviation from the horizontal reference meridian. Compared with the reference meridian, the SDVM (-3.46\u00b0\u00b17.32\u00b0, range: -18\u00b0 to 13\u00b0) exhibited greater average relative cyclotorsion versus the HSBM (0.41\u00b0\u00b14.92\u00b0, range: -10\u00b0 to 10\u00b0). Furthermore, the mean average misalignment was significantly less in the HSBM group versus the SDVM group (t=4.179, P<0.001). The VDM is likely a reliable marking method, similar to the HSBM. In contrast, the SDVM is not entirely reliable. The VDM usage may prevent inaccurate preoperative manual marking during toric IOL implantation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f15","authors":["Hung-Yuan Lin","Yi-Ting Fang","Ya-Jung Chuang","Justin N.
