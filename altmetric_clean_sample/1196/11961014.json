Responsible training and education is required to ensure healthcare providers are confident and skilled in the delivery of this care in both the rural and the urban setting. The Tropical Health and Education Trust (THET), a UK-based specialist global health organisation, is working with health training institutions, health professionals, Ministries of Health and Health Partnerships or 'links' between healthcare institutions in the UK and low- or middle-income country (LMIC) counterparts. These institutions may be hospitals, professional associations or universities whose primary focus is delivery of health services or the training and education of health workers. Since 2011, THET has been delivering the Health Partnership Scheme (HPS), a UK government-funded programme that provides grants and guidance to health partnerships and promotes the voluntary engagement of UK health professionals overseas. To date, the \u00a330 million Scheme has supported peer-to-peer collaborations involving more than 200 UK and overseas hospitals, universities and professional associations across 25 countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East.\nIn this paper, we focus on four partnerships that are undertaking training initiatives focused on building capacity for surgery and anaesthesia. In order to do so, we discuss their role as a responsible and effective approach to harnessing the expertise available in the UK in order to increase surgical and anaesthesia capacity in LMICs. Specifically, how well they: (1) respond to locally identified needs; (2) are appropriate to the local context and are of high quality; and (3) have an overarching goal of making a sustainable contribution to the development of the health workforce through education and training.\nThe HPS has now supported 24 training initiatives focused on building capacity for surgery and anaesthesia in 16 countries across sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and the Middle East. THET argues that these initiatives are both responsible and effective. The four partnerships featured in this paper have demonstrated not only their effectiveness in increasing health worker skills and knowledge, but have done so across a variety of surgical and anaesthesia disciplines and within different contexts. This wide reach and applicability of partnership initiatives adds even greater value to their use as responsible training interventions. One challenge that has faced these partnerships has been the capture of improvements to patient outcomes as a result of improved practice. To counteract the problems of data collection, partnerships are collecting anecdotal evidence of improvements at the patient outcome level.\nThe interventions supported by THET have been able to demonstrate success in improving health worker skills and knowledge, and albeit to a lesser extent, in improving patient outcomes. The implementing partners are achieving these successes by training responsibly: responding to locally identified need, implementing projects that are appropriate to the local context and are of high quality, and establishing mechanisms that ensure self-sufficiency of the health worker training and education that is delivered. Greater investment in responsible training initiatives such as these are required to address the significant lack of access to appropriate and safe surgical and anaesthesia interventions when needed and the growing burden of disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008c08","authors":["Laura Macpherson","Maggie Collins"],"doi":"10.1177\/0049475516665999","first_seen_on":"2016-09-12T12:38:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1758-1133","0049-4755"],"journal":"Tropical Doctor","last_mentioned_on":1493373668,"links":["http:\/\/tdo.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2016\/08\/30\/0049475516665999.full.pdf?ijkey=OgP0tOhM1NKbMvF&keytype=finite","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27578856?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/tdo.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2016\/08\/30\/0049475516665999.full.pdf","pmid":"27578856","pubdate":"2016-08-30T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Training responsibly to improve global surgical and anaesthesia capacity through institutional health partnerships: a case study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/training-responsibly-improve-global-surgical-anaesthesia-capacity-through-institutional-health-partn"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.8,"score_history":{"1y":3.8,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8137857,"mean":6.8794880300098,"rank":1847474,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":6286205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8137857,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249290,"mean":12.444661224522,"rank":75095,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":173963,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249290,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":311,"mean":2.8707225806452,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":282,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":311,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
