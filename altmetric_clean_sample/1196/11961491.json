These technologies are very promising in several fields such as environmental monitoring, precision agriculture, cold chain control or traceability. The paper focuses on WSN (Wireless Sensor Networks) and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification), presenting the different systems available, recent developments and examples of applications, including ZigBee based WSN and passive, semi-passive and active RFID. Future trends of wireless communications in agriculture and food industry are also discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5333cf058f6100045ba","authors":["Luis Ruiz-Garcia","Loredana Lunadei","Pilar Barreiro","Jose Ignacio Robla"],"doi":"10.3390\/s90604728","endpage":"4750","first_seen_on":"2016-09-12T13:21:50+00:00","issns":["1424-8220"],"issue":"6","journal":"Sensors (14248220)","last_mentioned_on":1473686490,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3291936\/"],"pmcid":"PMC3291936","pmid":"22408551","pubdate":"2016-09-12T20:09:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"4728","subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"A Review of Wireless Sensor Technologies and Applications in Agriculture and Food Industry: State of the Art and Current Trends","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/review-wireless-sensor-technologies-applications-agriculture-food-industry-state-art-current-trends-11"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366012,"mean":7.0543497525808,"rank":6348628,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1134110,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366012,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252579,"mean":12.460313107238,"rank":178080,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":42701,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252579,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3453,"mean":1.9826077636153,"rank":1891,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":961,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3453,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194,"mean":1.310621761658,"rank":87,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":61,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
