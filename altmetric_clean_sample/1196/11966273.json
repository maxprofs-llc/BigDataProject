Moreover, understanding the endoscopic appearances of gastritis is important for diagnosing gastric cancer due to the superficial mucosal lesions that mimic gastritis (gastritis-like lesions) are very difficult to detect even with optimum preparation and the best technique, and in such cases the tissue biopsy is often not very accurate for the diagnosis of gastric epithelial neoplasia. Magnifying endoscopy is a highly accurate technique for the detection of EGC (early gastric cancer). The aim of this review is to discuss how to evaluate high risk group for gastric cancer by endoscopy, and detect the signs of suspicious lesions by the conventional white light imaging (C-WLI) or chromoendoscopy (CE) effictively, and furthermore characterize the suspicious lesions using ME-IEE (magnifying endoscopy with image enhanced system) by the criteria and classification of EGC based upon VSCS (vessels and surface classification system). Moreover, recent reports have described various novel endoscopic markers which visualized by ME-IEE can predict specific histopathological findings. Diagnosis using ME-IEE with VSCS may provide excellent diagnostic performance with high confidence and good reproducibility to the endoscopist if it is performed under consistent conditions, including observation under maximal magnification.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d55","authors":["Soma, Nei"],"doi":"10.1111\/1751-2980.12404","first_seen_on":"2016-09-12T20:15:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1751-2980"],"journal":"Journal of Digestive Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1473711307,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1751-2980.12404\/pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1751-2980.12404\/pdf","pmid":"27577845","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"\n              Diagnosis of\n              Helicobacter pylori-\n              related chronic gastritis, gastric adenoma and early gastric cancer by magnifying endoscopy\n            ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diagnosis-helicobacter-pylorirelated-chronic-gastritis-gastric-adenoma-early-gastric-cancer-magnifyi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366012,"mean":7.0543497525808,"rank":1223925,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":7066539,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366012,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252580,"mean":12.460147375672,"rank":53681,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":195591,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252580,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261,"mean":2.7016615384615,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Magnifying Endoscopy With Enhanced Imaging IDs Gastric CA","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=27933626505&p=1pl&v=1&x=jjmhwKhdsXmOFmUyqH6cjA","license":"public","citation_ids":[11966273,11966273],"posted_on":"2016-09-12T20:15:07+00:00","summary":"MONDAY, Sept. 12, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Magnifying endoscopy with image-enhanced endoscopy (ME-IEE) may provide better diagnostic performance than conventional white light imaging (C-WLI) for early gastric cancer, according to an article\u2026","author":{"name":"Physician's Briefing","url":"http:\/\/www.physiciansbriefing.com","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/001\/372\/normal\/logo.png?1436525474"}}]}}
