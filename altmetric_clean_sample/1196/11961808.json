A cervical length of 25\u2009mm or less was defined as a shortened cervical length. The therapies prescribed include vaginal micronized progesterone capsules (200\u2009mg each night) or bed rest from 20 to 34 weeks of gestation. The primary outcome was spontaneous delivery before 33 weeks.\n(1) One hundred fourteen women had a cervical length of\u2009\u226425\u2009mm (0.45%). (2) Twenty-nine of which with previous spontaneous preterm delivery or late pregnancy loss had cervical cerclage, the remaining 85 women by the use of vaginal progesterone or simply resting activity restriction to prevent preterm birth. (3) In 85 nulliparous women treated by progesterone or bed rest, progesterone use in cervical length between 10 and 20\u2009mm was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of preterm birth at <33 weeks of gestation (9.5% versus 45.5%, p\u2009=\u20090.02) compared with bed rest. There were no significant differences in cervical length between 20 and 25\u2009mm in their rates of spontaneous preterm delivery at <33 (5.3% versus 3.2%, p\u2009=\u20090.72), <37 (33.3% versus 54.5%, p\u2009=\u20090.25), or <35 weeks (14.3% versus 45.5, p\u2009=\u20090.06) of gestation between vaginal progesterone and bed rest.\nThe rate of short cervical length was less than expected. Vaginal progesterone is efficacious for the prolonging of gestation in women with a cervical length of 10-20\u2009mm in the mid-trimester for a singleton gestation and nulliparous women. For a cervical length of 20-25\u2009mm in the mid trimester, vaginal progesterone compared with bed rest did not prolong pregnancy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610004043","authors":["Maerdan, Malipati","Shi, Chunyan","Zhang, Xiaoxiao","Fan, Lixin"],"doi":"10.1080\/14767058.2016.1220528","endpage":"4","first_seen_on":"2016-09-12T13:53:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1476-4954","1476-7058"],"journal":"Journal of Maternal-Fetal & Neonatal Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1473688413,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27600865"],"pmid":"27600865","pubdate":"2016-09-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["obstetrics","perinatology"],"title":"The prevalence of short cervix between 20 and 24 weeks of gestation and vaginal progesterone for prolonging of gestation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-short-cervix-between-20-24-weeks-gestation-vaginal-progesterone-prolonging-gestation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366012,"mean":7.0543497525808,"rank":6049387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2017466,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366012,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252579,"mean":12.460306178685,"rank":163962,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":74500,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252579,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1443,"mean":2.4682801664355,"rank":653,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":701,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1443,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":0.94125,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DrJordanND\/statuses\/775331517153234944","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[11961808],"posted_on":"2016-09-12T13:53:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Jordan Robertson ND","url":"http:\/\/www.DrJordanND.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/866611304542457858\/IlUvM7uG_normal.jpg","description":"Naturopathic Doctor and Clinic Owner in Downtown Burlington. 395 Pearl Street. 905-631-5353.","id_on_source":"DrJordanND","tweeter_id":"413332730","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":450},"tweet_id":"775331517153234944"}],"facebook":[{"title":"The prevalence of short cervix between 20 and 24 weeks of gestation and vaginal progesterone for prolonging of gestation. - PubMed - NCBI","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=952849674837346&id=124311324357856","license":"public","citation_ids":[11961808],"posted_on":"2016-09-12T13:53:29+00:00","summary":"If you've been put on bed-rest or diagnosed as having a short cervix in your second or third trimester, we may want to consider progesterone support combined with acupuncture to help you get to your due date. \n\nWe've had multiple women \"doomed\" for an earl","author":{"name":"Jordan Robertson | Burlington Naturopath","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/124311324357856","facebook_wall_name":"Jordan Robertson | Burlington Naturopath","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/124311324357856\/picture","id_on_source":"124311324357856"}}]}}
