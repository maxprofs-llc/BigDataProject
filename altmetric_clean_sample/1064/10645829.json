In particular, GDPs-associated calcium transients act as coincident detectors for enhancing synaptic efficacy at emerging GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses. Here, we show that, immediately after birth, in the CA3 hippocampal region of the BTBR T+tf\/J mouse, an animal model of idiopathic autism, GDPs are severely impaired. This effect was associated with an increased GABAergic neurotransmission and a reduced neuronal excitability. In spite its depolarizing action on CA3 pyramidal cells (in single channel experiments EGABA was positive to Em), GABA exerted at the network level an inhibitory effect as demonstrated by isoguvacine-induced reduction of neuronal firing. We implemented a computational model in which experimental findings could be interpreted as the result of two competing effects: a reduction of the intrinsic excitability of CA3 principal cells and a reduction of the shunting activity in GABAergic interneurons projecting to principal cells. It is therefore likely that premature changes in neuronal excitability within selective hippocampal circuits of BTBR mice lead to GDPs dysfunction and behavioral deficits reminiscent of those found in autistic patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Cellot, Giada","Maggi, Laura","Di Castro, Maria Amalia","Catalano, Myriam","Migliore, Rosanna","Migliore, Michele","Scattoni, Maria Luisa","Calamandrei, Gemma","Cherubini, Enrico","Giada Cellot","Laura Maggi","Maria Amalia Di Castro","Myriam Catalano","Rosanna Migliore","Michele Migliore","Maria Luisa Scattoni","Gemma Calamandrei","Enrico Cherubini"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep31696","first_seen_on":"2016-08-17T18:51:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handle":"2381\/40266","handles":["2381\/40266"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1503621140,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27526668?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4985660\/","https:\/\/lra.le.ac.uk\/handle\/2381\/40266"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/lra.le.ac.uk\/bitstream\/2381\/40266\/2\/Premature%20changes%20in%20neuronal%20excitability%20account%20for%20hippocampal%20network%20impairment%20and%20autistic-like%20behavior%20in%20neonatal%20BTBR%20T%2btf\/J%20mice.pdf","pmid":"27526668","pubdate":"2016-08-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Autism spectrum disorders","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Neural circuits","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"31696","subjects":["science"],"title":"Premature changes in neuronal excitability account for hippocampal network impairment and autistic-like behavior in neonatal BTBR T+tf\/J mice","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/premature-changes-neuronal-excitability-account-hippocampal-network-impairment-autisticlike-behavior"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8425604,"mean":7.0878923279354,"rank":4499966,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2346676,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8425604,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":255577,"mean":12.237817619807,"rank":139768,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":90844,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":255577,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37640,"mean":14.726924838598,"rank":21857,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":12527,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37640,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3299,"mean":16.622739842329,"rank":1841,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1163,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3299,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
