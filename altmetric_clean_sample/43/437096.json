In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that gene transfer of human FGF-2 via transplantation of genetically modified L8-myoblast encapsulated in alginate modulates the skeletal muscle recovery after crush injury in Wistar rats. Therefore, we performed a crush injury to the soleus muscle and transplanted alginate spheres containing myoblasts genetically modified to overexpress human FGF-2 (FGF-2) or a luciferase (LUC) cDNA at the site of injury. Animals that underwent muscle injury without transplantation of alginate spheres served as control (control). At day 4 after trauma the FGF-2 group showed significant higher mean values of cell proliferation (bromodeoxyuridine immunohistochemistry) and significant lower values of cell apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase nick end labeling histology) compared to animals receiving luciferase-overexpressing myoblasts. At the same time point adiponectin expression (ACRP30 immunohistochemistry) was increased in the FGF-2 group exclusively. The p75(NTR) expression (p75(NTR) immunohistochemistry) significantly improved in both the FGF-2 and LUC group compared to the control group. Functional analysis of the injured muscle did not reveal a significant increase of the muscle force in the FGF-2 group compared to the control and LUC group 14 days after injury. In vitro analysis for 14 days of the FGF-2-modified spheres demonstrated at day 7 and day 14 a significant increase of the relative cell count as well as of the relative viable cell count in the FGF-2 myoblast spheres compared to luciferase myoblast spheres. Additionally, the expression of FGF-2 (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis) and luciferase (chemiluminescence analysis) persisted in vitro for 4 and 14 days, respectively. These results demonstrate that FGF-2-overexpressing myoblasts cannot considerably improve muscle strength but are able to modulate the proliferation as well as the apoptosis of injured muscle tissue mainly by conducting adipogenesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008b9b","authors":["Ioannis Stratos","Henning Madry","Robert Rotter","Anja Weimer","Johannes Graff","Magali Cucchiarini","Thomas Mittlmeier","Brigitte Vollmar"],"doi":"10.1089\/ten.tea.2011.0239","endpage":"2877","first_seen_on":"2011-11-01T21:19:29+00:00","issns":["1937-3341","1937-335X"],"issue":"21-22","journal":"Tissue Engineering: Part A","last_mentioned_on":1320181023,"links":["http:\/\/www.liebertonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1089\/ten.tea.2011.0239"],"pmid":"21815803","pubdate":"2011-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"2867","subjects":["histology","biotechnology"],"title":"Fibroblast Growth Factor-2\u2013Overexpressing Myoblasts Encapsulated in Alginate Spheres Increase Proliferation, Reduce Apoptosis, Induce Adipogenesis, and Enhance Regeneration Following Skeletal Muscle Injury in Rats","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fibroblast-growth-factor2overexpressing-myoblasts-encapsulated-alginate-spheres-increase-proliferati"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":2671265,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1694423,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74043,"mean":4.5718907376894,"rank":32245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":27882,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74043,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":701,"mean":2.2379971428571,"rank":198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":701,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":0.78571428571429,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
