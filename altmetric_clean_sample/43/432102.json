Metchnikoff is rightly famous for his recognition of the biological significance of leukocyte recruitment and phagocytosis of microbes in host defence against infection, inflammation and immunity. As a comparative zoologist he utilised a broad range of model organisms for microscopic studies in vivo and in vitro. His work prefigures much of contemporary research in innate immunity. In this brief review, I cover some details of his Europe-wide life in Russia (mainly Odessa) and at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. He had a complex personality, yet his creative genius, imagination and insights justify the title of \"Father of natural immunity\".","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f610007351","authors":["Siamon Gordon","Gordon, Siamon","Gordon S"],"doi":"10.1002\/eji.200838855","endpage":"3264","first_seen_on":"2011-10-28T02:48:40+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["00142980","1521-4141","0014-2980"],"issue":"12","journal":"European Journal of Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1506519744,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/eji.200838855\/pdf","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19039772","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/eji.200838855","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/19039772\/","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/eji.200838855\/full","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19039772"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/eji.200838855\/pdf","pmid":"19039772","pubdate":"2008-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"3257","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Elie Metchnikoff: father of natural immunity.","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/elie-metchnikoff-father-natural-immunity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":42.422,"score_history":{"1y":22.85,"6m":22.85,"3m":21,"1m":1,"1w":1,"6d":1,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":42.422},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462170,"mean":7.1084920520889,"rank":224724,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":8237701,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462170,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":87274,"mean":5.3356054908162,"rank":1645,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":85629,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":87274,"percentile":98},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1761,"mean":2.7324465909091,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":1753,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1761,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":1.1903846153846,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":21,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
