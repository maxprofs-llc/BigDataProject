The synthesized polyelectrolyte nanogels promote the uptake of antigens into antigen-presenting cells and strongly induce ovalbumin-specific INF-\u03b3 producing cells, cytotoxic T cell activity, and antibody production.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6383cf058f610008951","authors":["Lim, Yong Taik","Shim, Sang\u2010Mu","Noh, Young\u2010Woock","Lee, Kyung\u2010Soon","Choi, Doo\u2010Yeol","Uyama, Hiroshi","Bae, Hee Ho","Kim, Ji Hyun","Hong, Kwan Soo","Sung, Moon\u2010Hee","Poo, Haryoung"],"doi":"10.1002\/smll.201101836","endpage":"3286","first_seen_on":"2011-10-27T14:30:31+00:00","issns":["1613-6829"],"issue":"23","journal":"Small","last_mentioned_on":1319724264,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/smll.201101836"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/smll.201101836\/pdf","pmid":"22009658","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u00e2\u0080\u0090VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"3281","subjects":["biomedicalengineering","nanotechnology"],"title":"Bioderived Polyelectrolyte Nanogels for Robust Antigen Loading and Vaccine Adjuvant Effects","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bioderived-polyelectrolyte-nanogels-robust-antigen-loading-vaccine-adjuvant-effects"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":2671266,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1694412,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72247,"mean":4.5935790216759,"rank":31705,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":26764,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72247,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1450,"mean":4.2569841269841,"rank":518,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":754,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1450,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":1.8771428571429,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
