Despite widespread national, international, and legal acceptance of the concept, substantial variation exists in the standards and their application, and there remains a need to clarify and standardize terminology (eg, ancillary and supplementary testing, brain death, or neurologic determination of death). The aim of this article is to review the specific criteria and requirements of brain death, paying special attention to areas of controversy and practice inconsistency.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005695","authors":["Teitelbaum J","Shemi SD"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ncl.2011.08.003","first_seen_on":"2011-10-31T07:28:43+00:00","issns":["1557-9875","0733-8619"],"issue":"4","journal":"Neurologic clinics","last_mentioned_on":1400625840,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22032661"],"pmid":"22032661","pubdate":"2011-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Neurologic determination of death.","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neurologic-determination-death"},"altmetric_score":{"score":21,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":21},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4710604,"mean":5.7124847209594,"rank":199201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":4510092,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4710604,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72312,"mean":4.4793181397021,"rank":2564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":69732,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72312,"percentile":96},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174,"mean":2.8924277456647,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":173,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":2.0833333333333,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
