Twenty-one men (mean age \u00b1 SD: 24.0 \u00b1 2.7 years) visited the exercise physiology laboratory on 2 occasions. During the first visit, they either performed an active warm-up (10 minutes of stationary cycling at 70% of predicted maximum heart rate) or sat quietly (no warm-up). Participants were then tested for isometric and isokinetic (60\u00b0, 180\u00b0, and 300\u00b0\u00b7s) PT, and RTD (measured as S-gradient) on an isokinetic dynamometer. Electromyographic and MMG sensors were placed over the vastus lateralis muscle to monitor the electrical and mechanical aspects of muscle contractions, respectively. The testing protocol used for the first visit was repeated for the second visit, but the preexercise treatment (warm-up, no warm-up) not given during the first visit was administered. The results indicated that an active warm-up did not affect PT, RTD, or measures of muscle activation as reflected by EMG amplitude, EMG frequency, or MMG frequency (p > 0.05). However, MMG amplitude at 180\u00b0\u00b7s was significantly greater in the warm-up condition compared with the no warm-up condition. The isolated increase in MMG amplitude suggested that warm-up may have affected the mechanical properties of muscle by reducing muscular stiffness or decreasing intramuscular fluid pressure, but that it was not sufficient to influence performance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f6100040e2","authors":["Altamirano KM","Coburn JW","Brown LE","Judelson DA"],"doi":"10.1519\/jsc.0b013e31822e7a85","first_seen_on":"2011-10-29T13:10:56+00:00","issns":["1533-4287"],"journal":"Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research","last_mentioned_on":1430994204,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22033367?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22033367"],"pmid":"22033367","pubdate":"2011-09-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Effects of Warm-up on Peak Torque, Rate of Torque Development, and Electromyographic and Mechanomyographic Signals.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-warmup-peak-torque-rate-torque-development-electromyographic-mechanomyographic-signals"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5067569,"mean":6.0017903301953,"rank":2086723,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":2898486,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5067569,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72653,"mean":4.6220297582998,"rank":22696,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":47787,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72653,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3072,"mean":15.517965483556,"rank":2163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":840,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3072,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":181,"mean":12.328822222222,"rank":126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":181,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":6,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":2,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":3,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Neuroscience":1,"Social Sciences":2,"Sports and Recreations":9,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1},"mendeley":{"CA":1,"GB":2,"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/Drleoncreaney\/status\/130258978713243648","citation_ids":[433865],"posted_on":"2011-10-29T12:25:35+00:00","author":{"id_on_source":"Drleoncreaney","tweeter_id":156220186},"tweet_id":"130258978713243648"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Isokinetics1\/status\/596259025790095360","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[433865],"posted_on":"2015-05-07T10:23:24+00:00","author":{"name":"Isokinetics","url":"http:\/\/www.isokinetics.net","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610712122373242880\/tYcr_0j-_normal.jpg","description":"Isokinetics is to keep the users of isokinetics machines up to date with everything in my world of isokinetics","id_on_source":"Isokinetics1","tweeter_id":"382193178","geo":{"lt":"52.5310214","ln":"-1.2649062","country":"GB"},"followers":89},"tweet_id":"596259025790095360"}]}}
