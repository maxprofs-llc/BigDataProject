Since subjects may have been diagnosed before cohort entry, analysis of late HIV diagnosis (LD) is usually restricted to the newly diagnosed. We estimate the magnitude and risk factors of LD in a cohort of seroprevalent individuals by imputing seroconversion dates. Methods. Multicenter cohort of HIV-positive subjects who were treatment naive at entry, in Spain, 2004-2008. Multiple-imputation techniques were used. Subjects with times to HIV diagnosis longer than 4.19 years were considered LD. Results. Median time to HIV diagnosis was 2.8 years in the whole cohort of 3,667 subjects. Factors significantly associated with LD were: male sex; Sub-Saharan African, Latin-American origin compared to Spaniards; and older age. In 2,928 newly diagnosed subjects, median time to diagnosis was 3.3 years, and LD was more common in injecting drug users. Conclusions. Estimates of the magnitude and risk factors of LD for the whole cohort differ from those obtained for new HIV diagnoses.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5193cf058f61000386a","authors":["Paz Sobrino-Vegas","Santiago P\u00e9rez-Hoyos","Ronald Geskus","Bel\u00e9n Padilla","Ferr\u00e1n Segura","Rafael Rubio","Jorge del Romero","Jesus Santos","Santiago Moreno","Julia del Amo"],"doi":"10.1155\/2012\/725412","first_seen_on":"2011-10-28T12:30:41+00:00","issns":["2090-1240","2090-1259"],"journal":"AIDS Research & Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1319803215,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3195500\/?tool=pmcentrez"],"pmid":"22013517","pubdate":"2011-10-28T20:12:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","title":"Imputation of the Date of HIV Seroconversion in a Cohort of Seroprevalent Subjects: Implications for Analysis of Late HIV Diagnosis","type":"article","volume":"2012","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/imputation-date-hiv-seroconversion-cohort-seroprevalent-subjects-implications-analysis-late-hiv-diag"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4702736,"mean":5.7127972403309,"rank":2501831,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1560482,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4702736,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70767,"mean":4.4748621089223,"rank":29969,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":29449,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70767,"percentile":41},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127,"mean":2.1365079365079,"rank":80,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.75,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
