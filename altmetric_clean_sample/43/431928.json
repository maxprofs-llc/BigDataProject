HLA-E engages a variety of immune receptors expressed by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), Natural killer (NK) cells and NK-CTLs. In view of the opposing outcomes (activation or inhibition) of the different HLA-E receptors, the preferred role (if any) of HLA-E expressed in vivo on tumor cells remains to be established.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000865","authors":["Maria Benevolo","Maria Benevolo","Marcella Mottolese","Elisa Tremante","Francesca Rollo","Maria Grazia Diodoro","Cristiana Ercolani","Isabella Sperduti","Elisa Lo Monaco","Maurizio Cosimelli","Patrizio Giacomini"],"doi":"10.1186\/1479-5876-9-184","first_seen_on":"2011-10-27T23:40:56+00:00","issns":["","1479-5876"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Translational Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1325008801,"links":["http:\/\/www.translational-medicine.com\/content\/9\/1\/184\/abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC3219584","pmid":"22032294","pubdate":"2011-10-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"184","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"High expression of HLA-E in colorectal carcinoma is associated with a favorable prognosis","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/high-expression-hlae-colorectal-carcinoma-associated-favorable-prognosis-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4704568,"mean":5.7145399098396,"rank":1810291,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":2857442,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4704568,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70730,"mean":4.4879025576496,"rank":19232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":50806,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70730,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1327,"mean":3.4192036199095,"rank":307,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":986,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1327,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":4.8394054054054,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
