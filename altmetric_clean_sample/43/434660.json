In a previous work, we developed RAPSearch, an algorithm that achieved a ~20-90-fold speedup relative to BLAST while still achieving similar levels of sensitivity for short protein fragments derived from NGS data. RAPSearch, however, requires a substantial memory footprint to identify alignment seeds, due to its use of a suffix array data structure. Here we present RAPSearch2, a new memory-efficient implementation of the RAPSearch algorithm that uses a collision-free hash table to index a similarity search database. The utilization of an optimized data structure further speeds up the similarity search-another 2-3 times. We also implemented multi-threading in RAPSearch2, and the multi-thread modes achieve significant acceleration (e.g. 3.5X for 4-thread mode). RAPSearch2 requires up to 2G memory when running in single thread mode, or up to 3.5G memory when running in 4-thread mode. Availability and implementation: Implemented in C++, the source code is freely available for download at the RAPSearch2 website: http:\/\/omics.informatics.indiana.edu\/mg\/RAPSearch2\/.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023d2","authors":["Zhao Y","Tang H","Ye Y"],"doi":"10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btr595","first_seen_on":"2011-10-30T19:05:48+00:00","issns":["1460-2059"],"journal":"Bioinformatics","last_mentioned_on":1472054693,"links":["http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2011\/10\/28\/bioinformatics.btr595.short?rss=1","http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/28\/1\/125.full?etoc","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/22039206\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22039206","http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/28\/1\/125.full.pdf","http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/28\/1\/125.long"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2011\/10\/28\/bioinformatics.btr595.full.pdf","pmid":"22039206","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Mathematics","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"RAPSearch2: a fast and memory-efficient protein similarity search tool for next-generation sequencing data","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rapsearch2-fast-memoryefficient-protein-similarity-search-tool-nextgeneration-sequencing-data"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8272014,"mean":6.980828736602,"rank":834707,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7435376,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8272014,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85765,"mean":5.2705329275687,"rank":8046,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":77710,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85765,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5715,"mean":6.8148799439972,"rank":1248,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":4462,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5715,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":4.2851153846154,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Scientists":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":9,"Researcher":60,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Student  > Ph.
