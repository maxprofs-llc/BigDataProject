The food supplement Aquamin is a natural multi-mineral derived from the red algae Lithothamnion corallioides, rich in calcium, magnesium and 72 other trace minerals. This study describes an anti-inflammatory role for Aquamin in inhibiting NF-\u03baB activation through reducing the phosphorylation and degradation of its upstream inhibitor I\u03baB\u03b1. Aquamin inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation results in significantly reduced cyclo-oxygenase-2 gene expression following treatment of macrophage cells with lipopolysaccharide. These data suggest that nutritional supplements such as Aquamin may play an important role in regulating the inflammatory response by modulating the nuclear factor kappa B signalling pathway.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005c3a","authors":["O'Gorman DM","O'Carroll C","Carmody RJ","Denise M.
