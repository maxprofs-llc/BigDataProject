The calcified disk material can herniate anteriorly, inducing dysphagia, or herniate posteriorly, causing neurologic symptoms secondary to spinal cord compression. We report computed tomography and magnetic resonance findings of a symptomatic intervertebral disk calcification at the C2-3 level with retropharyngeal edema caused by anterior herniation of calcified material in a 7-year-old boy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bf0","doi":"10.1097\/rhu.0b013e31823266ba","first_seen_on":"2011-10-30T22:26:31+00:00","issns":["1076-1608"],"issue":"7","journal":"Journal of Clinical Rheumatology","last_mentioned_on":1342754310,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jclinrheum\/Abstract\/2011\/10000\/Acute_Symptomatic_Intervertebral_Disk.5.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jclinrheum\/2011\/10000\/Acute_Symptomatic_Intervertebral_Disk.5.pdf","pmid":"21946461","pubdate":"2011-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"365","subjects":["rheumatology","orthopedics","physiology"],"title":"Acute Symptomatic Intervertebral Disk Calcification in a Child With Retropharyngeal Edema: Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Findings","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/acute-symptomatic-intervertebral-disk-calcification-child-retropharyngeal-edema-computed-tomography"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4770545,"mean":5.7208170586012,"rank":2367680,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2259312,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4770545,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70691,"mean":4.467638477861,"rank":27797,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":40787,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70691,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":858,"mean":1.3918553092182,"rank":163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":677,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":858,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":0.8375,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Sports and Recreations":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/JCR_Online\/status\/130743894085341184","citation_ids":[434798],"posted_on":"2011-10-30T20:32:28+00:00","author":{"id_on_source":"JCR_Online","tweeter_id":431193031},"tweet_id":"130743894085341184"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Acute Symptomatic Intervertebral Disk Calcification in a Chi... : JCR: Journal of Clinical Rheumatol","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=482513368444651&id=131481643624487","citation_ids":[434798],"posted_on":"2012-07-20T03:18:30+00:00","summary":"Most Popular:","author":{"name":"JCR: Journal of Clinical Rheumatology","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/131481643624487","facebook_wall_name":"JCR: Journal of Clinical Rheumatology","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/131481643624487\/picture","id_on_source":"131481643624487"}}]}}
