PtCl(4) (2-) complexes are attached to a thiol-terminated monolayer by ligand exchange of Cl(-) with a thiolate group and incorporated in a multilayer of viologen moieties by ion exchange. All Cl(-) ligands are replaced by OH(-) or H(2) O before HER takes place. Ex situ and in situ XAFS measurements confirm that the Pt complexes accelerate HER without being converted into Pt particles.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006895","authors":["Masuda, Takuya","Fukumitsu, Hitoshi","Takakusagi, Satoru","Chun, Wang\u2010Jae","Kondo, Toshihiro","Asakura, Kiyotaka","Uosaki, Kohei"],"doi":"10.1002\/adma.201102491","endpage":"272","first_seen_on":"2011-10-31T14:08:30+00:00","issns":["1521-4095"],"issue":"2","journal":"Advanced Materials","last_mentioned_on":1320062586,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/adma.201102491"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/adma.201102491\/pdf","pmid":"21972009","pubdate":"2011-04-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u00e2\u0080\u0090VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Engineering","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"startpage":"268","subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"title":"Molecular Catalysts Confined on and Within Molecular Layers Formed on a Si(111) Surface with Direct Si\u00e2\u0080\u0093C Bonds","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-catalysts-confined-within-molecular-layers-formed-si111-surface-direct-sic-bonds"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":2671662,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1695205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73760,"mean":4.5680788785097,"rank":31790,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":28900,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73760,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3422,"mean":8.7736778719673,"rank":1883,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":1291,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3422,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":4.1224150943396,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
