Although segments B of classical and very virulent IBDVs differ significantly, re-assortment of genome segments does occur, and molecular epidemiological studies demand the analysis of both segments. An RT-PCR and restriction enzyme analysis for molecular discrimination between genome segment B of classical and very virulent IBDVs is described. Tested on eight IBDV strains\/isolates, the protocol successfully identified very virulent and classical IBDVs as well as a segment reassortant. This approach is a valuable tool for molecular epidemiological studies on IBDV.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000230f","doi":"10.1007\/s00705-011-1159-9","first_seen_on":"2011-11-02T09:28:16+00:00","issns":["1432-8798"],"journal":"Archives of Virology","last_mentioned_on":1320219600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22038074?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22038074","pubdate":"2011-10-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Differentiation of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) genome segment B of very virulent and classical lineage by RT-PCR amplification and restriction enzyme analysis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/differentiation-infectious-bursal-disease-virus-ibdv-genome-segment-b-very-virulent-classical-lineag"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":2671720,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1696061,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74456,"mean":4.540216640924,"rank":32012,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":29800,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74456,"percentile":40},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":911,"mean":2.0015274725275,"rank":390,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":433,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":911,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.424375,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"BD":1,"PE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/Kenzibit\/status\/131636663687454720","citation_ids":[437758],"posted_on":"2011-11-02T07:40:00+00:00","author":{"id_on_source":"Kenzibit","tweeter_id":365001921},"tweet_id":"131636663687454720"}]}}
