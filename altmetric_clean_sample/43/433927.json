One of their common denominators is hypogonadism. However, testosterone supplementation is limited by concerns for potential prostatic side effects. The objective was to determine whether MetS-associated prostate alterations are prevented by testosterone supplementation. We used a previously described animal model of MetS, obtained by feeding male rabbits a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks. Subsets of HFD rabbits were treated with testosterone or with the farnesoid X receptor agonist INT-747. Rabbits fed a standard diet were used as controls. HFD-animals develop hypogonadism and all the MetS features: hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and visceral obesity. In addition, HFD-animals show a prostate inflammation. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that HFD-induced prostate fibrosis, hypoxia, and inflammation. The mRNA expression of several proinflammatory (IL8, IL6, IL1\u03b2, and TNF\u03b1), T lymphocyte (CD4, CD8, Tbet, Gata3, and ROR \u03b3t), macrophage (TLR2, TLR4, and STAMP2), neutrophil (lactoferrin), inflammation (COX2 and RAGE), and fibrosis\/myofibroblast activation (TGF\u03b2, SM22\u03b1, \u03b1SMA, RhoA, and ROCK1\/ROCK2) markers was significantly increased in HFD prostate. Testosterone, as well as INT-747, treatment prevented some MetS features, although only testosterone normalized all the HFD-induced prostate alterations. Interestingly, the ratio between testosterone and estradiol plasma level retains a significant, negative, association with all the fibrosis and the majority of inflammatory markers analyzed. These data highlight that testosterone protects rabbit prostate from MetS-induced prostatic hypoxia, fibrosis, and inflammation, which can play a role toward the development\/progression of BPH\/LUTS.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d78","authors":["Linda Vignozzi","Annamaria Morelli","Erica Sarchielli","Paolo Comeglio","Sandra Filippi","Ilaria Cellai","Elena Maneschi","Sergio Serni","Mauro Gacci","Marco Carini","Marie-Pierre Piccinni","Farid Saad","Luciano Adorini","Gabriella B Vannelli","Mario Maggi"],"doi":"10.1530\/joe-11-0289","endpage":"84","first_seen_on":"2011-10-29T15:04:22+00:00","issns":["1479-6805","0022-0795"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1485449641,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22010203","http:\/\/m.joe.endocrinology-journals.org\/content\/212\/1\/71.full.pd"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/joe.endocrinology-journals.org\/content\/212\/1\/71.full.pdf","pmid":"22010203","pubdate":"2011-10-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"71","subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Testosterone protects from metabolic syndrome-associated prostate inflammation: an experimental study in rabbit.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/joe.endocrinology-journals.org\/cgi\/doi\/10.1530\/JOE-11-0289","volume":"212","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/testosterone-protects-metabolic-syndromeassociated-prostate-inflammation-experimental-study-rabbit"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.1,"score_history":{"1y":1.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082038,"mean":6.8946982576228,"rank":803977,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7277405,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082038,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86124,"mean":5.2032510014746,"rank":7973,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":78142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86124,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":944,"mean":4.105164369035,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":901,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":944,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.1833333333333,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":10},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":10}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
