The companies that are now involved in this research-demanding area will have to face several challenges. The key factor for success will be an in-depth molecular understanding of the pathophysiology and the mechanism of the drug under development. The one-disease-one-drug-one-target paradigm that has been prevailing for decades is history. Most diseases are heterogeneous and based on molecular profiling they can be divided into biological subgroups that each requires a specific pharmacological intervention.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002734","doi":"10.1016\/j.drudis.2011.09.010","first_seen_on":"2011-10-29T18:47:14+00:00","issns":["1878-5832"],"issue":"19-20","journal":"Drug Discovery Today","last_mentioned_on":1319910833,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21945860"],"pmid":"21945860","pubdate":"2011-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"SUNY","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"A challenging drug development process in the era of personalized medicine.","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/challenging-drug-development-process-era-personalized-medicine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":2671203,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1694110,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72362,"mean":4.5782183220243,"rank":31690,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":26504,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72362,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":725,"mean":4.4471298342541,"rank":457,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":175,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":725,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":3.99,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
