Unlike other collimated beams of light, appropriately designed solenoid beams have the noteworthy property of being able to exert forces on illuminated objects that are directed opposite to the direction of the light's propagation. We demonstrate this through video microscopy observations of a colloidal sphere moving upstream along a holographically projected optical solenoid beam.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f6100083d6","authors":["Sang-Hyuk Lee","Yohai Roichman","David G.
