Traditional protective factors for breast cancer such as multiparity and early primaparity actually increase the risk for the triple-negative variant. Unlike other breast cancers, the incidence of this disease is also much higher in African American and West African women. Among those with triple-negative disease in the United States, the mortality rates are also highest in African American women. Variations in risk factors and socioeconomic status, lack of treatment, delays in treatment, and inadequate dosing of chemotherapy are just a few of the many reasons that may explain why this incidence and survival disparity persists.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100057c7","doi":"10.1097\/ppo.0b013e3181d3eef5","first_seen_on":"2011-10-30T10:52:22+00:00","issns":["1528-9117"],"issue":"1","journal":"Cancer Journal","last_mentioned_on":1319966365,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/journalppo\/Abstract\/2010\/02000\/Triple_Negative_Breast_Cancers__A_View_From_10,000.4.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/journalppo\/2010\/02000\/Triple_Negative_Breast_Cancers__A_View_From_10,000.4.pdf","pmid":"20164686","pubdate":"2010-02-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"17","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Triple-Negative Breast Cancers: A View From 10,000 Feet","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/triplenegative-breast-cancers-view-10000-feet"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4770545,"mean":5.7208170586012,"rank":2533463,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1588823,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4770545,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70692,"mean":4.4675929609144,"rank":30110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":28893,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70692,"percentile":40},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":359,"mean":1.7726983240223,"rank":105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":359,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.625,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
