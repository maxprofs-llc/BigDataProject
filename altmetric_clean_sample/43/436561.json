Considering that alterations in the signaling pathways that regulate neuroplasticity and cellular survival are implicated in depressive disorders, the present study investigated the involvement of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3\u03b2), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) in the antidepressant-like effect of folic acid in the forced swimming test (FST). The intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) pre-treatment of mice with LY294002 (10 nmol\/site, a PI3K inhibitor) or GW-9662 (1 \u00b5g\/site, a PPAR\u03b3 antagonist) prevented the antidepressant-like effect of folic acid (50 mg\/kg, p.o.) in the FST. In addition, the administration of subeffective doses of the selective GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitor, AR-A014418 (3 mg\/kg, i.p.), a non-selective GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitor, lithium chloride (10 mg\/kg, p.o) or a PPAR\u03b3 agonist, rosiglitazone (1 \u00b5g\/site, i.c.v.) in combination with a subeffective dose of folic acid (10 mg\/kg, p.o.) significantly reduced the immobility time in the FST as compared with either drug alone, without altering the locomotor activity. These results indicate that the antidepressant-like effect of folic acid in the FST might be dependent on inhibition of GSK-3\u03b2 and activation of PPAR\u03b3, reinforcing the notion that these are important targets for antidepressant activity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002eeb","doi":"10.1177\/0269881111424456","first_seen_on":"2011-11-01T11:57:22+00:00","issns":["1461-7285"],"journal":"Journal of Psychopharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1320147130,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22037925?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22037925","pubdate":"2011-10-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["psychopharmacology"],"title":"Involvement of PI3K, GSK-3\u03b2 and PPAR\u03b3 in the antidepressant-like effect of folic acid in the forced swimming test in mice.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/involvement-pi3k-gsk3%CE%B2-ppar%CE%B3-antidepressantlike-effect-folic-acid-forced-swimming-test-mice-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":2671720,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1696061,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74015,"mean":4.5545504364039,"rank":31869,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":29572,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74015,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":786,"mean":9.5613452229299,"rank":453,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":256,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":786,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":15.08,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/anxietynews\/status\/131332701146984449","citation_ids":[436561],"posted_on":"2011-11-01T11:32:10+00:00","author":{"id_on_source":"anxietynews","tweeter_id":156415937},"tweet_id":"131332701146984449"}]}}
