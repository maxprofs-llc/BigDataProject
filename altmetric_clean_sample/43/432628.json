However, this assumption is both theoretically and empirically contested. This systematic review examined existing research comparing online and offline self-disclosure to ascertain the evidence for current theories of online communication. Studies that compared online and offline disclosures in dyadic interactions were included for review. Contrary to expectations, disclosure was not consistently found to be greater in online contexts. Factors such as the relationship between the communicators, the specific mode of communication, and the context of the interaction appear to moderate the degree of disclosure. In relation to the theories of online communication, there is support for each theory. It is argued that the overlapping predictions of each theory and the current state of empirical research highlights a need for an overarching theory of communication that can account for disclosure in both online and offline interactions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c1","authors":["Melanie Nguyen","Yu Sun Bin","Andrew Campbell","Nguyen M","Bin YS","Campbell A"],"doi":"10.1089\/cyber.2011.0277","endpage":"111","first_seen_on":"2011-10-28T13:22:11+00:00","issns":["2152-2715","2152-2723"],"issue":"2","journal":"CyberPsychology, Behavior & Social Networking","last_mentioned_on":1421725519,"links":["http:\/\/www.liebertonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1089\/cyber.2011.0277","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1089\/cyber.2011.0277","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22032794"],"pmid":"22032794","pubdate":"2011-10-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 140 Huguenot Street, 3rd Floor New Rochelle, NY 10801 USA","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information Systems","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"111027124908006","subjects":["behavioralsciences","psychology"],"title":"Comparing Online and Offline Self-Disclosure: A Systematic Review.","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparing-online-offline-selfdisclosure-systematic-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.918,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.918},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4758711,"mean":5.4938017449299,"rank":444471,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":4314424,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4758711,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70910,"mean":4.4072071528297,"rank":6166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":64744,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70910,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":566,"mean":19.410559292035,"rank":147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":419,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":566,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":5.3785,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":17,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Ph.
