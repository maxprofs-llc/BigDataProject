Animal studies have shown that both gender and sex hormones play an important role in inflammatory regulation. Human data are scant regarding the role of gender and sex hormones in developing ARDS. Our objective was to describe gender and hormonal differences in patients who develop ARDS in a large cohort of critically injured adults.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005ad1","doi":"10.1097\/ta.0b013e31822c0d31","first_seen_on":"2011-10-27T11:38:49+00:00","funders":["niaid","nhlbi"],"issns":["0022-5282","2163-0755"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Trauma","last_mentioned_on":1320115409,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jtrauma\/Abstract\/2011\/10000\/Gender_and_Acute_Respiratory_Distress_Syndrome_in.15.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jtrauma\/2011\/10000\/Gender_and_Acute_Respiratory_Distress_Syndrome_in.15.pdf","pmid":"21986736","pubdate":"2011-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"878","title":"Gender and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in Critically Injured Adults: A Prospective Study","type":"article","volume":"71","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gender-ards-critically-injured-adults-prospective-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4770728,"mean":5.7212246032958,"rank":2533486,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1588251,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4770728,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71009,"mean":4.4959454146011,"rank":30395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":28730,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71009,"percentile":40},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":736,"mean":5.1623945578231,"rank":411,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":194,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":736,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143,"mean":1.5161971830986,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":92,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/JTrauma_Online\/status\/129508613818560512","citation_ids":[431122],"posted_on":"2011-10-27T10:43:54+00:00","author":{"id_on_source":"JTrauma_Online","tweeter_id":282880720},"tweet_id":"129508613818560512"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/JTrauma_Online\/status\/131199652501528577","citation_ids":[431122],"posted_on":"2011-11-01T02:43:29+00:00","author":{"id_on_source":"JTrauma_Online","tweeter_id":282880720},"tweet_id":"131199652501528577"}]}}
