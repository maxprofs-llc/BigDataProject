The impact of HIV-specific funds and programmes on non-HIV-related health services and health systems in genera has been debated extensively. Drawing on evidence from Malawi and Ethiopia, this article analyses the effects of ART scale-up interventions on human resources policies, service delivery and general health outcomes, and explores how synergies can be maximized.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000867","authors":["Freya Rasschaert","Marjan Pirard","Mit P Philips","Rifat Atun","Edwin Wouters","Yibeltal Assefa","Bart Criel","Erik J Schouten","Wim Van Damme"],"doi":"10.1186\/1758-2652-14-s1-s3","first_seen_on":"2011-10-31T13:06:09+00:00","issns":[""],"issue":"Suppl 1","journal":"Journal of the International AIDS Society","last_mentioned_on":1403601892,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3194148\/?tool=pmcentrez","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3194148\/"],"pmcid":"PMC3194148","pmid":"21967809","pubdate":"2011-10-31T20:11:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"S3","subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome"],"title":"Positive spill-over effects of ART scale up on wider health systems development: evidence from Ethiopia and Malawi","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/positive-spillover-effects-art-scale-up-wider-health-systems-development-evidence-ethiopia-malawi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":2055782,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2956415,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73774,"mean":4.5759299472707,"rank":22329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":51212,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73774,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":788,"mean":4.5131613722999,"rank":389,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":389,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":788,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":3.1575,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":3,"Researcher":17,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
