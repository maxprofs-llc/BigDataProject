A distributive sensing scheme is designed to monitor the dynamics of the sensing structure. An artificial neural network is used to process the measured data and to identify cell presence and density. Without specifying any particular bio-application, the investigation is mainly concentrated on the performance testing of this kind of biosensor as a general biosensing platform. The biosensing experiments on the microfabricated membranes involve seeding different cell densities onto the sensing surface of membrane, and measuring the corresponding dynamics information of each tested silicon membrane in the form of a series of frequency response functions (FRFs). All of those experiments are carried out in cell culture medium to simulate a practical working environment. The EA.hy 926 endothelial cell lines are chosen in this paper for the bio-experiments. The EA.hy 926 endothelial cell lines represent a particular class of biological particles that have irregular shapes, non-uniform density and uncertain growth behaviour, which are difficult to monitor using the traditional biosensors. The final predicted results reveal that the methodology of a neural-network based algorithm to perform the feature identification of cells from distributive sensory measurement has great potential in biosensing applications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c7a","authors":["Wu Z","Choudhury K","Griffiths HR","Xu J","Ma X"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10544-011-9587-6","endpage":"93","first_seen_on":"2011-10-28T10:38:29+00:00","issns":["1572-8781","1387-2176"],"issue":"1","journal":"Biomedical Microdevices","last_mentioned_on":1373358855,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21915644?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s10544-011-9587-6","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21915644"],"pmid":"21915644","pubdate":"2011-09-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Materials Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"83","subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"A novel silicon membrane-based biosensing platform using distributive sensing strategy and artificial neural networks for feature analysis.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-silicon-membranebased-biosensing-platform-using-distributive-sensing-strategy-artificial-neura"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628675,"mean":4.9393923648184,"rank":681030,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":2923859,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628675,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67256,"mean":3.8301565980224,"rank":10485,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":56455,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67256,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":1.7994492753623,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":9.862,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
