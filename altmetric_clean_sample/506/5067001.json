Surveys addressed trainee feelings about end-of-life care. Latent variable modeling was used to identify indicators of trainee pessimism, and this pessimism construct was used to assess temporal changes in trainee attitudes about end-of-life care. We also examined predictors of trainee pessimism at baseline and follow-up. Data were available for 383 trainees from two training programs.\nThere was a significant decrease in pessimism between baseline and follow-up assessments. Age had a significant inverse effect on baseline pessimism, with older trainees being less pessimistic. There was a direct association of race\/ethnicity on pessimism at follow-up, with greater pessimism among minority trainees (P=0.028). The model suggests that between baseline and follow-up, pessimism among younger white non-Hispanic trainees decreased, whereas pessimism among younger trainees in racial\/ethnic minorities increased over the same time period.\nOverall, trainee pessimism about end-of-life care decreases over time. Pessimism about end-of-life care among minority trainees may reflect the influence of culture on clinician attitudes about communication with seriously ill patients. Further research is needed to understand the evolution of trainee attitudes about end-of-life care during clinical training.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002ea6","authors":["Long, Ann C","Downey, Lois","Engelberg, Ruth A","Ford, Dee W","Back, Anthony L","Curtis, J Randall","Ann C.
