Furthermore, the kinetics of circulating cytokine storms related to viral and secondary bacterial infection were analyzed.\nWithin complex and dynamic communities, the lung microbiome with H7N9 infection were dominated by gram-negative bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii after the viral invasion and during the whole clinical course. Sputum and blood culture confirmed the secondary bacterial infection with multidrug-resistant A. baumannii 9 days later. The dynamics of the bacterial infection with carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii correlated with antibiotic therapy. Our observations also indicated that sustained high levels of host inflammatory factors, consisting of a set of distinct cytokines associated with disease stage, may contribute to disease progression and death.\nThis study demonstrates an initial attempt to explore the dynamic microbiome involved inH7N9 infection and its response to antimicrobial therapy, as well as host cytokine response to infection by using next-generation sequencing. These type of investigations with longitudinal follow-up to understand dynamics of microbial community and cytokines involved in lung infection may provide opportunities for development and optimization of targeted antimicrobial therapy and even new therapeutic strategies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d09","authors":["Hu, Yongfeng","Zhang, Yan","Ren, Xianwen","Liu, Yingmei","Xiao, Yan","Li, Li","Yang, Fan","Su, Haoxiang","Liu, Feng","Liu, Haiying","Cao, Bin","Jin, Qi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jcv.2015.12.013","first_seen_on":"2016-01-31T11:33:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-5967","1386-6532"],"journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","last_mentioned_on":1454529619,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26826577?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.journalofclinicalvirology.com\/article\/S1386-6532(16)00002-0\/abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jcv.2015.12.013","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26826577?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pmid":"26826577","pubdate":"2016-01-31T22:00:10+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"A case report demonstrating the utility of next generation sequencing in analyzing serial samples from the lung following an infection with influenza A (H7N9) virus.","type":"article","volume":"76","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/case-report-demonstrating-utility-next-generation-sequencing-analyzing-serial-samples-lung-following"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7089314,"mean":6.2945947100909,"rank":2560973,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4505679,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7089314,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320501,"mean":9.3430066458655,"rank":102863,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":215860,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320501,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":693,"mean":4.3456445086705,"rank":224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":466,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":693,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":2.0853513513514,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
