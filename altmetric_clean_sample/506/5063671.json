Approximately one-half of the refugee group who agreed to complete the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire had post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. On clinician-rated measures, one-third of the children, adolescents and adults suffered with clinical symptoms requiring tertiary outpatient assessment.\nThis paper consolidates the findings of the 2014 Australian Human Rights Commission report and it provides an argument for public reporting of refugee data.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51d3cf058f610003973","authors":["Peter Young","Michael S Gordon"],"doi":"10.1177\/1039856215624247","endpage":"22","first_seen_on":"2016-01-30T02:42:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1440-1665"],"issue":"1","journal":"Australasian Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1462236429,"links":["http:\/\/apy.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2016\/01\/08\/1039856215624247.full.pdf?ijkey=wjDDazso7R6V9dN&keytype=finite","http:\/\/apy.sagepub.com\/content\/24\/1\/19.abstract?rss=1","http:\/\/apy.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2016\/01\/08\/1039856215624247"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/apy.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2016\/01\/08\/1039856215624247.full.pdf","pmid":"26755798","pubdate":"2016-01-30T22:24:11+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"19","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Mental health screening in immigration detention: A fresh look at Australian government data","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mental-health-screening-immigration-detention-fresh-look-australian-government-data-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":29.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":29.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7644999,"mean":6.5733031223765,"rank":256326,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":7388446,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7644999,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":326808,"mean":9.4500455620592,"rank":16788,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":310012,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":326808,"percentile":94},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":873,"mean":2.4787706422018,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":865,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":873,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":4.1290952380952,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
