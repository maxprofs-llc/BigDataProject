However, recent reports have suggested that individuals with autism may be at greater risk for schizophrenia and that the conditions may be more closely related than generally believed.\nThe authors examined detailed case records of 163 adolescents and adults with well-documented histories of autism. These cases included 139 males and 24 females.\nOnly one individual had an unequivocal history of schizophrenia.\nIf the present study group is taken to be representative, it appears that the frequency of schizophrenia among autistic patients (0.6%) is roughly comparable to the frequency of schizophrenia in the general population. It does not appear that the two conditions are more commonly observed together than would be expected on a chance basis; therefore, the current (DSM-III-R) approach to dual diagnosis of these conditions appears reasonable.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002216","authors":["Volkmar, F R","Cohen, D J"],"doi":"10.1176\/ajp.148.12.1705","first_seen_on":"2016-01-29T11:14:19+00:00","issns":["0002-953X"],"issue":"12","journal":"American Journal of Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1454168314,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1957933"],"pmid":"1957933","pubdate":"1991-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Comorbid association of autism and schizophrenia.","type":"article","volume":"148","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comorbid-association-autism-schizophrenia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7062006,"mean":6.279377068691,"rank":2906486,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4073574,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7062006,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319841,"mean":9.2654594422208,"rank":125839,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":189102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319841,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4093,"mean":10.657644183773,"rank":2874,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4093,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65,"mean":18.44428125,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65,"percentile":49}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
