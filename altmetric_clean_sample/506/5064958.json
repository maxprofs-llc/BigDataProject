Although it has been reported to occur spontaneously or after any ophthalmic procedure, it is most commonly encountered after glaucoma surgery in eyes with prior chronic angle closure. The clinical diagnosis is made in the setting of a patent peripheral iridotomy and axial flattening of the anterior chamber. Intraocular pressure is usually elevated, but it may be normal in some cases. Although the exact etiology of this condition is not fully understood, several mechanisms have been proposed and it is thought to result from posterior misdirection of aqueous humor into or behind the vitreous. This review discusses pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, imaging modalities, and current treatment strategies for this rare form of secondary glaucoma.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f610004087","authors":["Foreman-Larkin, Julie","Netland, Peter A","Salim, Sarwat"],"doi":"10.1155\/2015\/283707","first_seen_on":"2016-01-30T12:12:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2090-004X"],"journal":"Journal of Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1454155956,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26819754?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC4706935","pmid":"26819754","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Clinical Management of Malignant Glaucoma.","type":"article","volume":"2015","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-management-malignant-glaucoma-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7062006,"mean":6.279377068691,"rank":6071584,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7062006,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319031,"mean":9.3331821019964,"rank":262939,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319031,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":460,"mean":1.4594379084967,"rank":251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":460,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77,"mean":1.0414473684211,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
