We report our experience on the safety and efficacy of sofosbuvir\/simeprevir and sofosbuvir\/ledipasvir therapy in patients on hemodialysis.\nPatients with chronic HCV infection on hemodialysis were included in this study. Patients were started on either sofosbuvir\/simeprevir or sofosbuvir\/ledipasvir. Routine clinical and laboratory data were collected at baseline and during treatment. The primary outcome was sustained virologic response at week 12 (SVR12).\nEight patients with mean age 56.8 \u00b1 20 years were included in the study. Seven were treatment na\u00efve and one was a prior null responder to interferon-based therapy. Four patients were started on sofosbuvir\/simeprevir and four on sofosbuvir\/ledipasvir for 12 weeks. Therapy was well tolerated overall with nausea\/vomiting, pruritus, headache and a 2g\/dl drop in hemoglobin developing in one patient each. No patient discontinued therapy due to side effects. Comparison of labs at baseline and nadir levels during treatment revealed no significant change in hemoglobin (10.8\u00b12.4 g\/dL vs 10.3\u00b11.6 g\/dL), platelet count (198\u00b1164 k\/uL vs184.5\u00b1162\/uL) and bilirubin (0.3\u00b10.4 mg\/dL vs 0.25\u00b10.15 mg\/dl). 8\/8 patients had undetectable HCV RNA at the end of treatment. One patient was lost to follow up and the remaining seven achieved SVR12.\nFull dose sofosbuvir\/simeprevir or sofosbuvir\/ledipasvir therapy for HCV-infected patients with end stage renal disease was well-tolerated with no discontinuation due to side effects and no significant adverse events.
