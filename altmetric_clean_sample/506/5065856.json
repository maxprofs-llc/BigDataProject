Design Cross-sectional survey design. Setting A community-based rehabilitation program within the United States. Participants Fifty-six adults (33 males and 23 females; age 18 to 73 [M\u00a0=\u00a039.4, SD\u00a0=\u00a012.7]) with SCI participating in the community-based rehabilitation program. Methods Subjects identified the top five problematic secondary health conditions related to his\/her SCI, belief about the impact these conditions have on social participation and daily life, and if they believed the secondary health condition(s) were avoidable. Results The top problematic areas identified were bladder control, pain, bowel control, and pressure ulcers, and 73% felt these problems were unavoidable. In addition, more than 66% had each of these problems continuously during the last 12 months. When examining the impact of the problematic secondary health conditions, 75% identified that the primary problem had a significant impact on social participation and 64% identified it significantly impacted daily life. Conclusion Although the majority of the participants were actively participating in a community-based rehabilitation wellness program, it appears that they thought engagement in social participation and daily life were negatively impacted by the secondary health conditions and unavoidable. The results suggested unfulfilled goals despite the emphasized efforts of medical providers to help manage the secondary conditions. Future research should examine why individuals with SCI still have a difficult time managing secondary health conditions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005aaf","authors":["Jennifer A.
