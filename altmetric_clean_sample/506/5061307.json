Recent work showed an essential role for coronin 1 in the modulation of the cAMP\/PKA pathway in neurons through the interaction of coronin 1 with the G protein subtype G\u03b1s in a stimulus-dependent manner, but the molecular mechanism regulating coronin 1-G\u03b1s interaction remains unclear. We here show that phosphorylation of coronin 1 on Thr(418\/424) by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 5 activity was responsible for coronin 1-G\u03b1s association and the modulation of cAMP production. Together these results show an essential role for CDK5 activity in promoting the coronin 1-dependent cAMP\/PKA pathway.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028b7","authors":["Liu, Xiaolong","BoseDasgupta, Somdeb","Jayachandran, Rajesh","Studer, Vera","R\u00fchl, Sebastian","Stiess, Michael","Pieters, Jean"],"doi":"10.1002\/1873-3468.12046","endpage":"287","first_seen_on":"2016-01-29T13:46:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-3468"],"issue":"2","journal":"Febs Letters","last_mentioned_on":1454075199,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/1873-3468.12046\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/1873-3468.12046\/pdf","pmid":"26823173","pubdate":"2016-01-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"279","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Activation of the cAMP\/protein kinase A signalling pathway by coronin 1 is regulated by cyclin\u2010dependent kinase 5 activity","type":"article","volume":"590","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/activation-campprotein-kinase-signalling-pathway-coronin-1-regulated-cyclindependent-kinase-5-activi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7060796,"mean":6.2779102203052,"rank":5289894,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":990594,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7060796,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319810,"mean":9.2637478182287,"rank":220346,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":56405,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319810,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3907,"mean":2.8878858166923,"rank":3344,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":283,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3907,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108,"mean":1.7523364485981,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
