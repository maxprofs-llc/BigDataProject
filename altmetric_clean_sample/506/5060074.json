For a systematic investigation of the enzyme inhibitory activity of hemibastadin derivatives, we have synthesized nine new congeners, which feature structural variations of the DBHB core structure. These structural modifications include, e.g., different halogen substituents present at the aromatic rings, different amine moieties linked to the (E)-2-(hydroxyimino)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid, the presence of free vs. substituted aromatic hydroxyl groups and a free vs. methylated oxime group. All compounds were tested for their inhibitory activity towards the target enzyme in vitro, and IC50 values were calculated. Derivatives, which structurally closely resemble sponge-derived hemibastadins, revealed superior enzyme inhibitory properties vs. congeners featuring structural moieties that are absent in the respective natural products. This study suggests that natural selection has yielded structurally-optimized antifouling compounds.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f61000668a","authors":["Niemann, Hendrik","Hagenow, Jens","Chung, Mi-Young","Hellio, Claire","Weber, Horst","Proksch, Peter"],"doi":"10.3390\/md13053061","first_seen_on":"2016-01-29T11:04:01+00:00","issns":["1660-3397"],"issue":"5","journal":"Marine Drugs","last_mentioned_on":1454065414,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25988522?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25988522","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["biology","pharmacology"],"title":"SAR of Sponge-Inspired Hemibastadin Congeners Inhibiting Blue Mussel PhenolOxidase.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sar-spongeinspired-hemibastadin-congeners-inhibiting-blue-mussel-phenoloxidase"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7060796,"mean":6.2779102203052,"rank":3515869,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2033534,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7060796,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319810,"mean":9.2636357200701,"rank":166847,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":118266,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319810,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":866,"mean":3.4526612716763,"rank":466,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":294,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":866,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":4.275,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":3,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/sponge_papers\/statuses\/693026694731472897","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5060074],"posted_on":"2016-01-29T11:03:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Sponge Papers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","description":"Recent papers on sponges (Phylum Porifera).","id_on_source":"sponge_papers","tweeter_id":"2801421163","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":60},"tweet_id":"693026694731472897"}]}}
