This study aimed to investigate the effects of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) plus insulin on ED in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats.\nForty-five eight-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats received intraperitoneal injection of STZ (60\u00a0mg\/kg). Eight weeks after the induction, the determined diabetic rats were randomly distributed into four groups: rats in DM\u00a0+\u00a0PBS group received a one-time intracavernous (IC) injection of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution, DM\u00a0+\u00a0ADSCs group received IC injection of ADSCs, DM\u00a0+\u00a0Insulin group received subcutaneous injection of neutral protamine Hagedorn twice a day, and DM\u00a0+\u00a0ADSCs\u00a0+\u00a0Insulin group received both ADSCs and neutral protamine Hagedorn treatments. Another 10 normal rats were served as control group and received IC injection of PBS. Four weeks after the treatments, intracavernous pressure, histopathological changes in penis, functional proteins of ADSCs, and penis were measured.\nWe found that ADSCs expressed vascular endothelial growth factor, TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 (TIMP-1), and lipopolysaccharide-inducible CXC chemokine (LIX). ADSC injection partially restored cavernous endothelium and smooth muscle contents and nNOS-positive nerves, and reduced apoptosis in penis compared with PBS-treated diabetic rats. Insulin treatment could further modulate inflammatory response and reduce advanced glycation end-product accumulation in penis.\nBetter than single therapy, ADSCs combined with insulin ameliorate ED and pathological changes in diabetic rats to near-normal levels.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007a5e","authors":["Zhou, Feng","Hui, Yu","Xu, Yongde","Lei, Hongen","Yang, Bicheng","Guan, Ruili","Gao, Zhezhu","Xin, Zhongcheng","Hou, Jianquan"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11255-016-1221-3","first_seen_on":"2016-01-29T13:32:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-2584"],"journal":"International Urology and Nephrology","last_mentioned_on":1454074269,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26820518?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26820518","pubdate":"2016-01-29T22:00:23+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nephrology"],"title":"Effects of adipose-derived stem cells plus insulin on erectile function in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-adiposederived-stem-cells-plus-insulin-erectile-function-streptozotocininduced-diabetic-rats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7060796,"mean":6.2779102203052,"rank":3515881,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2033506,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7060796,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319810,"mean":9.2637434406158,"rank":166851,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":118257,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319810,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":473,"mean":1.7578008474576,"rank":162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":236,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":473,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":0.88125,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Social Sciences":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"BE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MuscleStemCell\/statuses\/693063834819436544","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5061242],"posted_on":"2016-01-29T13:31:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Satellite Cell Bot","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507221205141577729\/FQlptquo_normal.jpeg","description":"Tweeting articles on muscle stem cells from pubmed RSS feeds.","id_on_source":"MuscleStemCell","tweeter_id":"2788297100","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":225},"tweet_id":"693063834819436544"}]}}
