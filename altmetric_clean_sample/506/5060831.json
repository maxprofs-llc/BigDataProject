In view of the key role of the amygdala in the acquisition and expression of fear memory, we investigated the involvement of basolateral amygdala (BLA) serotonin 5-HT4 receptors in arachidonylcyclopropylamide (ACPA; selective CB1 cannabinoid receptor agonist)-induced fear memory consolidation impairment. In our study, a context and tone fear conditioning apparatus was used for testing fear conditioning in adult male NMRI mice. The results showed that intraperitoneal administration of ACPA 0.5 or 0.05, 0.1 and 0.5mg\/kg immediately after training decreased the percentage of freezing time in context or tone fear conditioning respectively, suggesting a context- or tone- dependent fear memory consolidation impairment. Post-training intra-BLA microinjections of RS67333, as 5-HT4 serotonin receptor agonist, at doses of 0.025 and 0.05\u00b5g\/mouse also impaired context or tone memory consolidation, while RS23597, as 5-HT4 serotonin receptor antagonist, did not produce a marked difference in both fear memories as compared with the control group. Moreover, a subthreshold dose of RS67333 did not alter ACPA response in both fear conditionings. Interestingly, a subthreshold dose of RS23597 potentiated or reversed ACPA response at the dose of 0.01 or 0.05 respectively. It is concluded that BLA serotonin 5-HT4 receptors are involved in tone-dependent fear memory consolidation impairment induced by CB1 activation using ACPA, suggesting a modulatory role for serotonin 5-HT4 receptor.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002427","authors":["Nasehi, Mohammad","Davoudi, Kamelia","Ebrahimi-Ghiri, Mohaddeseh","Zarrindast, Mohammad-Reza"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.brainres.2016.01.034","first_seen_on":"2016-01-29T12:08:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1872-6240"],"journal":"Brain Research","last_mentioned_on":1454069323,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26820636?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26820636","pubdate":"2016-01-29T22:00:21+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["brain"],"title":"Interplay between serotonin and cannabinoid function in the amygdala in fear conditioning.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interplay-between-serotonin-cannabinoid-function-amygdala-fear-conditioning"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7060796,"mean":6.2779102203052,"rank":5289893,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":990607,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7060796,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319809,"mean":9.2637677168798,"rank":220346,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":56414,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319809,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3150,"mean":3.5443671006669,"rank":2369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":486,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3150,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115,"mean":3.4469298245614,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
