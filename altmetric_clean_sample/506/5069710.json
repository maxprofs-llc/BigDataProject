For proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), the isolation of cocrystals has not been widely investigated. Here, a 1:1 cocrystal of a PPI molecule, dexlansoprazole (DLS), was obtained by solvent crystallization with isonicotinamide (INM). The product was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), solid-state and liquid NMR, as well as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) techniques. A two-point R2(2)(9) hetero-synthon was proposed to exist in the cocrystal, where intermolecular hydrogen bonding occurs between NH, SO groups of DLS and amide of INM. The dissolution profiles of DLS and DLS-INM in water were also collected, and the results demonstrate the cocrystal exhibits superior apparent maximum solubility relative to the pure drug.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000284c","authors":["Li, Jianhui","Wang, Lianyan","Ye, Yue Qi","Fu, Xue","Ren, Qinghua","Zhang, Hailu","Deng, Zongwu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ejps.2016.01.029","first_seen_on":"2016-02-01T09:19:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["09280987","1879-0720"],"journal":"European Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1498330387,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S092809871630029X&_version=1&md5=064b47ef95e4cf58fd3ea6c6203c3c28","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ejps.2016.01.029"],"pmid":"26836368","pubdate":"2016-02-03T22:00:21+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["chemistry","pharmacology"],"title":"Improving the solubility of dexlansoprazole by cocrystallization with isonicotinamide ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/improving-solubility-dexlansoprazole-cocrystallization-isonicotinamide"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":865807,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7517518,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":336773,"mean":9.6537886403852,"rank":44857,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":290639,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":336773,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":754,"mean":4.9567091633466,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":692,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":754,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71,"mean":7.4871428571429,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":55,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
