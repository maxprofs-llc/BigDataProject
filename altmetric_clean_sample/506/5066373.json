The data analysis only included patients with at least 18months of post-treatment follow up (FU).\nPatients were treated with either single fraction or fractionated SRS.\nPatient demographics and tumor characteristics were assessed. Radiographic control was determined by comparing pre and post treatment MRI, and was categorized as no change, regression, or progression.\nEighteen patients were treated with SRS, and 14 met inclusion criteria. Median age at treatment was 55years (range 35-79), and 71.4% of patients were female. 5 patients (35.7%) received single fraction SRS (dose range 15-18Gy), and 9 (64.3%) fractionated therapy (dose 3-7Gy\u00d73-15 fractions). Median tumor volume was 3.78cm(3) (range 1.15-30.6). Median FU was 28.8months (range 18.6-56.1), with a mean of 31.7months. At their last recorded MRI, 7 patients (50%) had tumor stability, 6 (42.9%) had improvement, and 1 (7.1%) had progression. Disease improvement and progression rates in the single fraction group were 40% and 0%, and in the multiple-fraction group, 44.4% and 11.1%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in disease improvement (p=0.88) or progression (p=0.48) rates between groups (unpaired t-test).\nAt a median follow up of 28months, both single fraction and fractionated SRS appear to have comparable radiographic tumor control outcomes and toxicity profiles.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005712","authors":["Daniel Schuster","Alex D.
