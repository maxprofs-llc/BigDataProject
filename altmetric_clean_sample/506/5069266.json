In this manuscript, we use the majorizeminimize method to develop an algorithm for minimizing the LASSO objective function, which is the sum of a linear leastsquares objective function plus an \u21131 penalty term. The proposed algorithm, which we call the LASSO estimation via majorizationminimization (LMM) algorithm, is straightforward to implement, parallelizable, and guaranteed to produce LASSO objective function values that monotonically decrease. Additionally, we formulate an extension of the LMM algorithm for reconstructing ground penetrating radar (GPR) images that is much faster than the standard LMM algorithm and utilizes significantly less memory. Thus, the GPR specific LMM (GPR-LMM) algorithm is able to accommodate the \"big data\" associated with GPR imaging. We compare our proposed algorithms to state-of-the-art \u21131-regularized LS algorithms using a time and space complexity analysis. The GPR-LMM greatly outperforms the competing algorithms in terms of the performance metrics we considered. Additionally, the reconstruction results of standard LMM and GPR-LMM algorithms are evaluated using both simulated and real GPR datasets.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a5c","authors":["Ndoye, Mandoye","Anderson, John","Greene, David"],"doi":"10.1109\/tip.2016.2518862","first_seen_on":"2016-02-01T05:53:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1941-0042"],"journal":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","last_mentioned_on":1454305984,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26800538"],"pmid":"26800538","pubdate":"2016-02-01T22:08:54+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Artificial Intelligence And Image Processing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physical Sciences","Computer Science"],"subjects":["medicalinformatics"],"title":"An MM-Based Algorithm for \u21131-Regularized Least-Squares Estimation with an Application to Ground Penetrating Radar Image Reconstruction.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mmbased-algorithm-l1regularized-leastsquares-estimation-application-ground-penetrating-radar-image-r"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7069916,"mean":6.2881480770247,"rank":5297022,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":991324,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7069916,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320412,"mean":9.3460759025124,"rank":220954,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":56141,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320412,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237,"mean":2.3114491525424,"rank":161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":0.965625,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Computer Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/rowlandm\/statuses\/694035719778541568","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5069266],"posted_on":"2016-02-01T05:53:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Rowland Mosbergen","url":"http:\/\/www.stemformatics.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1736419404\/SAM_7610_normal.JPG","description":"Can't stop tweeting about injustice.
