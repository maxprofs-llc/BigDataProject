Clofarabine-induced defect in DNA replication, induces p53 and subsequently P53R2 genes as subunit of RR. clofarabine deregulated P53R2 gene expression leading to the elevated levels of P53R2 which impose resistance to DNA damaging drugs. In this study the apoptotic and cytotoxic effects of clofarabine has been investigated on breast cancer cell line.\nCofarabine cytotoxicity on T47D cells has been studied by MTT assay. T47D cells were exposed to the different concentrations of clofarabine for 24, 48 and 72 hours intervals. Relative expression of P53R2 gene has been studied using real-time PCR. Moreover, after treating with clofarabine the apoptotic and necrotic cells were detected using Annexin V and propodium iodide (PI) reagents by flowcytometry technique.\nMTT assay results showed that the clofarabine IC50 on T47D cell line were 3 and 2.5\u00b5M after 48 and 72 h exposure, respectively. Clofarabine did not show any significant cytotoxic effect after 24 h exposure. The analysis of qRT-PCR showed a significant increase in P53R2 gene expression in treated cells with both 2.5 and 3 \u03bcM doses and also, the results of flowcytometry revealed 26.91 and 74.46 percent apoptosis induction in 48 and 72h treatments respectively in comparison to the control groups.\nOur results showed that apoptotic and cytotoxic effects of clofarabine on T47D cell line were in time and dose dependent manner; therefore it could be considered a new candidate in breast cancer therapy.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef762a83ee09648b521f","authors":["Rahmati-Yamchi, Mohammad","Zarghami, Nosratollah","Nozad Charoudeh, Hojjatollah","Ahmadi, Yasin","Baradaran, Behzad","Khalaj-Kondori, Mohammad","Milani, Morteza","Akbarzadeh, Abolfazl","Shaker, Maghsud","Pourhassan-Moghaddam, Mohammad"],"doi":"10.15171\/apb.2015.064","first_seen_on":"2016-01-29T11:05:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2228-5881"],"issue":"4","journal":"Advanced Pharmaceutical Bulletin","last_mentioned_on":1454067610,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26819918?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4729341","pmid":"26819918","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Clofarabine Has Apoptotic Effect on T47D Breast Cancer Cell Line via P53R2 Gene Expression.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clofarabine-apoptotic-effect-t47d-breast-cancer-cell-line-via-p53r2-gene-expression"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7060796,"mean":6.2779102203052,"rank":5289879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":990649,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7060796,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319810,"mean":9.2636821540354,"rank":220335,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":56450,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319810,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73,"mean":1.7526388888889,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.425,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
