Objective and methods Dismal outcome of surgical and radiotherapic therapies for advanced ear carcinoma required a critical discussion of the oncological principles of treatment. Our analysis involved preliminarily a detailed description of surgical technique including the contribution of modern skull base microsurgery. Results Evident limits in diagnostic protocols, surgical treatment and outcome evaluation modalities pointed to the need of a new approach towards an accurate definition of pre-operative tumor location, size, and behavior. En bloc resection achieved a specimen for a final pathological evaluation and an adjunctive piecemeal excision was necessary only whenever resection was not felt falling in safe, tumor-free tissue. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy should be considered in selected cases for adjuvant treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5173cf058f610003806","authors":["Mazzoni, Antonio","Zanoletti, Elisabetta","Marioni, Gino","Martini, Alessandro"],"doi":"10.3109\/00016489.2015.1126352","first_seen_on":"2016-01-30T14:57:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1651-2251"],"journal":"Acta Oto-Laryngologica","last_mentioned_on":1454165686,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26824405?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26824405","pubdate":"2016-01-30T22:00:20+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"En bloc temporal bone resections in squamous cell carcinoma of the ear.
