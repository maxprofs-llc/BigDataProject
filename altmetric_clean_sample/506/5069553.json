The selectivity of AB61 was found to be due to inefficient phosphorylation of AB61 in normal fibroblasts. The phosphorylation of AB61 in leukemic CCRF-CEM cell line proceeds well and it was shown that AB61 is incorporated into both DNA and RNA, preferentially as a ribonucleotide. It was further confirmed that a triphosphate of AB61 is a substrate for both RNA and DNA polymerases in enzymatic assays. Gene expression analysis suggests that AB61 affects DNA damage pathways and protein translation\/folding machinery. Indeed, formation of large 53BP1 foci was observed in nuclei of AB61-treated U2OS-GFP-53BP1 cells indicating DNA damage. Random incorporation of AB61 into RNA blocked its translation in an in vitro assay and reduction of reporter protein expression was also observed in mice after 4h treatment with AB61. AB61 also significantly reduced tumor volume in mice bearing SK-OV-3, BT-549 and HT-29 xenografts. The results indicate that AB61 is a promising compound with unique mechanism of action and deserves further development as an anticancer agent.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081e0","authors":["Pavla Perl\u00edkov\u00e1","Gabriela Rylov\u00e1","Petr Nau\u0161","Tom\u00e1\u0161 Elbert","Eva Tlou\u0161\u0165ov\u00e1","Aurelie Bourderioux","Lenka Po\u0161tov\u00e1 Slav\u011bt\u00ednsk\u00e1","Kamil Motyka","Dalibor Dole\u017eal","Pawel Znojek","Alice Nov\u00e1","Monika Harvanov\u00e1","Petr D\u017eub\u00e1k","Michal Siller","Jan Hlav\u00e1\u010d","Mari\u00e1n Hajd\u00fach","Michal Hocek","Michal \u0160iller"],"doi":"10.1158\/1535-7163.mct-14-0933","first_seen_on":"2016-02-01T07:51:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1538-8514"],"issue":"5","journal":"Molecular Cancer Therapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1466760503,"links":["http:\/\/mct.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/01\/27\/1535-7163.MCT-14-0933.abstract","http:\/\/mct.aacrjournals.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/1535-7163.MCT-14-0933v2","http:\/\/mct.aacrjournals.org\/content\/15\/5\/922"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/mct.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/01\/27\/1535-7163.MCT-14-0933.full.pdf","pmid":"26819331","pubdate":"2016-02-01T22:02:46+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["antineoplasticagents"],"title":"7-(2-Thienyl)-7-deazaadenosine (AB61), a new potent nucleoside cytostatic with a complex mode of action","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/72thienyl7deazaadenosine-ab61-new-potent-nucleoside-cytostatic-complex-mode-action"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7940332,"mean":6.711930007446,"rank":3583482,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4277659,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7940332,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":331236,"mean":9.5067414614998,"rank":137581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":187874,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":331236,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1304,"mean":5.8332371450499,"rank":460,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":819,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1304,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73,"mean":10.639611111111,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
