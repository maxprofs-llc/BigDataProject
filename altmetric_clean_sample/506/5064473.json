Of those who fulfilled the clinical criteria (at least one initial lesion with LF value >10 in second molars), 51 gave their written consent to participate. Laser fluorescence values were registered at baseline and after 1-month follow-up period. All participants were individually taught targeted tooth brushing of their second molars and randomly provided tooth paste with 0 or 1500 ppm fluoride. Brushing frequency was investigated at baseline and after the follow-up. Change in LF values was compared considering the tooth, content of fluoride in the paste and brushing frequency.\nIn lesions with LF values \u226430 at baseline, change in LF values demonstrated improvement. Improvement was detected especially in upper molars. In lesions with LF values >30 at baseline, improvement was least detected. Brushing frequency increased slightly during the intervention.\nLaser fluorescence is a simple method and useful in monitoring remineralization of incipient lesions even in weeks. Targeted tooth brushing seems to induce remineralization even in weeks. Laser fluorescence could be a valuable motivating tool in promoting patients' self-care.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f61000599f","authors":["Laitala, M\u2010L","Jaanti, E","V\u00e4h\u00e4nikkil\u00e4, H","M\u00e4\u00e4tt\u00e4, T","Heikka, H","Hausen, H","Anttonen, V","Laitala, M-L"],"doi":"10.1111\/idh.12205","endpage":"n\/a","first_seen_on":"2016-01-30T11:08:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1601-5037"],"journal":"International Journal of Dental Hygiene","last_mentioned_on":1454158324,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/idh.12205"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/idh.12205\/pdf","pmid":"26822105","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"n\/a","subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Laser fluorescence in monitoring the influence of targeted tooth brushing on remineralization of initial caries lesions on newly erupted molar teeth \u2013 RCT","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/laser-fluorescence-monitoring-influence-targeted-tooth-brushing-remineralization-initial-caries-lesi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7062006,"mean":6.279377068691,"rank":3306748,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":3571036,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7062006,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319030,"mean":9.3332176259835,"rank":152176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":154108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319030,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283,"mean":3.9225106382979,"rank":158,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":2.0638888888889,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Dddent2\/statuses\/693390330259988480","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5064473],"posted_on":"2016-01-30T11:08:31+00:00","author":{"name":"Dddent","url":"http:\/\/www.dddent.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/423503651621978113\/NWm_RF4b_normal.jpeg","description":"Sell Dental Products - Submit Dental Articles, News - 100% FREE!\nhttp:\/\/www.dddent.com","id_on_source":"Dddent2","tweeter_id":"429177119","geo":{"lt":34.05223,"ln":-118.24368,"country":"US"},"followers":25803},"tweet_id":"693390330259988480"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JamesDental\/statuses\/693416388665290752","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5064473],"posted_on":"2016-01-30T12:52:04+00:00","author":{"name":"James Family Dental","url":"http:\/\/jamesfamilydentistry.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2827452387\/ed9361ee5c3fb21f1bddba1e1489fd73_normal.png","description":"We love seeing new patients and would be pleased if you came to talk to us about your dental health.","id_on_source":"JamesDental","tweeter_id":"462046548","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":129},"tweet_id":"693416388665290752"}]}}
