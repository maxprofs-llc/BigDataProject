Patients who consecutively sought medical attendance in a primary care unit were asked about their headaches over the last 12 months. Those who had migraine were included. A semi-structured interview, the Headache Impact Test and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were used.\n147 patients had migraine; 78 had osmophobia; 60 had significant anxiety symptoms; and 78 had significant depression symptoms. The mean age of these patients was 43.2 years (\u00b1 13.7); 91.2% were women. The mean length of time with complaints of headache was 13.8 years (\u00b1 12). Among the migraine patients, those with anxiety, more years of headache history, and phonophobia presented significantly more osmophobia (multivariate logistic regression).\nOsmophobia in migraine patients is associated with significant anxiety symptoms, length of headache history, and phonophobia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003282","authors":["Rocha-Filho, Pedro Augusto Sampaio","Sobral Marques, Karine","Santos Torres, Rinailda Cascia","Ribas Leal, Kamila Nazare"],"doi":"10.1093\/pm\/pnv071","first_seen_on":"2016-01-29T15:45:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1526-4637"],"journal":"Pain Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1454930367,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26814297\/?ncbi_mmode=std"],"pmid":"26814297","pubdate":"2016-01-29T22:02:25+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"Migraine, Osmophobia, and Anxiety.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/migraine-osmophobia-anxiety"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7140824,"mean":6.3067650711939,"rank":3584823,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2041896,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7140824,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320566,"mean":9.2857659881768,"rank":167549,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":118088,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320566,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1246,"mean":6.9130891566265,"rank":672,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":437,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1246,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":7.4935185185185,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Neuroscience":1,"Social Sciences":3,"Business, Management and Accounting":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/headachedoc\/statuses\/693097637696966660","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5061874],"posted_on":"2016-01-29T15:45:28+00:00","author":{"name":"Robert Shapiro","url":"http:\/\/www.uvm.edu\/medicine\/neuro\/?Page=profile.php&bioID=23183","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000092683915\/fc10a411214d2f67a08f12745f1ab874_normal.jpeg","description":"doctor, advocate; tweets my own;  retweet \u2260 endorsement; tweet content \u2260 medical advice","id_on_source":"headachedoc","tweeter_id":"20725882","geo":{"lt":44.00034,"ln":-72.74983,"country":"US"},"followers":1943},"tweet_id":"693097637696966660"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ahsheadache\/statuses\/696654569359671296","license":"gnip","rt":["headachedoc"],"citation_ids":[5061874],"posted_on":"2016-02-08T11:19:27+00:00","author":{"name":"AmericanHeadacheSoc","url":"http:\/\/www.americanheadachesociety.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/892210870994034690\/Yg6ZvNnw_normal.jpg","description":"American Headache Society\u00ae professionals dedicated to the study & treatment of #migraine, #headache & facial pain. @AMFMigraine @AHMAorg @HeadacheJournal","id_on_source":"ahsheadache","tweeter_id":"21025173","geo":{"lt":40.16706,"ln":-74.49987,"country":"US"},"followers":5513},"tweet_id":"696654569359671296"}]}}
