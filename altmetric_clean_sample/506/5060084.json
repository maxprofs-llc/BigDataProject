Patients diagnosed with a colorectal carcinoma or diverticulitis who were operated on were included. Factors that characterize frailty of patients were noted. The incidence rates of delirium after elective and acute surgery were recorded. Delirium was diagnosed using the Delirium Observation Screening Scale (DOSS). Preoperative evaluation, surgical outcome including morbidity, hospital stay and mortality were analysed.\npatients \u226565 years were included, 83 (75%) received elective and 28 (25%) acute surgery. The overall incidence of delirium was 21%, 18% for elective and 29% for patients having urgent surgery (p=0.24). Patients with delirium were older than the non-delirious patients (median 82 years vs. 74 years; p<0.001). Delirious patients showed higher incidence of adverse events. Hospital stay, mortality and discharge to a nursing home were significant higher in the delirious compared to the non-delirious group (p=0.01; 0.01; 0.02 respectively).\nhigh incidence of delirium was found in both acute and elective colorectal surgery. Delirium was associated with adverse outcomes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079f1","authors":["Raats, J W","Steunenberg, S L","Crolla, R M P H","Wijsman, J H H","Slaa, A Te","van der Laan, L"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijsu.2015.04.080","first_seen_on":"2016-01-29T11:04:56+00:00","issns":["1743-9159"],"journal":"International Journal of Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1454065474,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25937152?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25937152","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Postoperative delirium in elderly after elective and acute colorectal surgery: A Prospective Cohort Study.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/postoperative-delirium-elderly-after-elective-acute-colorectal-surgery-prospective-cohort-study-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7060796,"mean":6.2779102203052,"rank":5289865,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":990714,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7060796,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319810,"mean":9.2636333749204,"rank":220329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":56488,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319810,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":808,"mean":2.0635712515489,"rank":400,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":247,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":808,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":2.35,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
