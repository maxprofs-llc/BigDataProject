The \u03c9-3 PUFAs were administered orally, once a day, for 15\u00a0days before pulp exposure and, subsequently, 30\u00a0days after pulp exposure. Rats were killed 30\u00a0days after pulp exposure, and jaws were subjected to histologic and immunohistochemical analyses. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed to detect tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive osteoclasts and osteocalcin-positive osteoblasts on the bone surface of periapical area. Results were statistically evaluated by using analysis of variance and Tukey honestly significant difference, and P\u00a0<\u00a0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nThe bone resorption lesion was significantly larger in the AP group compared with AP-O, C, and C-O groups (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). The level of inflammatory cell infiltration was significantly elevated, and the number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive osteoclasts was significantly higher in the periapical lesions of the AP group compared with AP-O, C, and C-O groups (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). The number of osteocalcin-positive osteoblasts was significantly increased in the AP-O group compared with the AP group (P\u00a0>\u00a0.05).\nSupplementation with \u03c9-3 PUFAs not only suppresses bone resorption but also promotes new bone formation in the periapical area of rats with AP in conjunction with downregulation of inflammatory cell infiltration into the lesion.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f6a","authors":["Mariane Maffei Azuma","Jo\u00e3o Eduardo Gomes-Filho","Edilson Ervolino","Camila Barbosa Pipa","Carolina de Barros Morais Cardoso","Ana Cristina Andrada","Toshihisa Kawai","Luciano Tavares Angelo Cintra"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.joen.2017.01.006","first_seen_on":"2017-04-09T15:22:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00992399"],"journal":"Journal of Endodontics","last_mentioned_on":1491751319,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0099239917300110"],"pmid":"28359664","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Omega 3 Fatty Acids Reduce Bone Resorption While Promoting Bone Generation in Rat Apical Periodontitis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/omega-3-fatty-acids-reduce-bone-resorption-while-promoting-bone-generation-rat-apical-periodontitis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8029393,"mean":6.8051641093086,"rank":4232073,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2234481,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8029393,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235656,"mean":12.849432271753,"rank":132041,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":82365,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235656,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":939,"mean":1.5026567164179,"rank":239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":599,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":939,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":0.95471698113208,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/mshaelms\/statuses\/851092837374590976","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18683189],"posted_on":"2017-04-09T15:21:59+00:00","author":{"name":"\u0645\u0634\u0627\u0639\u0644  \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0645\u0631\u064a","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/634844506114752512\/21F3nWee_normal.jpg","description":"\u0628\u0639\u064a\u062f\u0627\u064b \u0639\u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0638\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u0648 \u0628\u0639\u064a\u062f\u0627\u064b \u0639\u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0647\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0645\u062b\u0644 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u064a\u060c\u0648\u062c\u0647\u0629 \u0646\u0638\u0631\u064a\u060c\u0648\u0643\u0644 \u0645\u0627 \u064a\u062f\u0648\u0631 \u0641\u064a \u0641\u0643\u0631\u064a \u0641\u062e\u0648\u0631\u0647 \u0628\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f\u064a\u062a\u064a\u060c \u0637\u0628\u064a\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0633\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0646\u062f\u0641\u0639\u0647.. \u0627\u0628\u0646\u0629 \u0644\u0640 \u062f\u0643\u062a\u0648\u0631 \u0633\u064a\u0627\u0633\u064a \u0648\u0633\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0639\u0638\u064a\u0645\u0647","id_on_source":"mshaelms","tweeter_id":"382250514","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":79},"tweet_id":"851092837374590976"}]}}
