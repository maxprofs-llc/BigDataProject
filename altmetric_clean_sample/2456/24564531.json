The present study was designed to verify the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of the ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extraction from Gastrodia elata Blume (GEB) on the BBB by developing a model of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in rats.\nMCAO\/R model in rats was developed through a thread embolism method. The neurological scales, the moisture and the evans blue (EB) contents of brains were detected. Meanwhile, the release of nitric oxide (NO) and activities of NO synthase (NOS) in brain tissues were measured. Western blotting analyses were also performed to assess the protein expressions of AQP-4, Occludin and Claudin-5 in brain tissue.\nAfter rats were pretreated with different concentrations of EtOAc extractions from GEB, the neurologic scores, the EB contents in the brain tissues and the moisture of the brains were significantly decreased. Meanwhile, the release of NO, the activities of nNOS and iNOS were notably inhibited. Furthemore, the protein expression of AQP-4 was markedly decreased, but the protein expressions of -5 and Occludin were significantly increased.\nthe EtOAc extracts of GEB may decrease the permeability of BBB when focal cerebral ischemia occurs. The inhibition of the NOS pathways, the attenuation of the protein expression of AQP-4 and the enhancement of the expressions of the tight junction proteins may contribute to the protective effects of the EtOAc extracts from GEB on BBB.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa57a3cf058f610004da9","authors":["Fangyan He","Xiaohua Duan","Rong Dai","Wei Wang","Cui Yang","Qing Lin"],"doi":"10.21010\/ajtcam.v13i4.26","first_seen_on":"2017-08-31T10:32:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["01896016","25050044","2505-0044"],"issue":"4","journal":"African Journal of Traditional, Complementary & Alternative Medicines","last_mentioned_on":1504175525,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28852737?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC5566145","pmid":"28852737","pubdate":"2016-07-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"PROTECTIVE EFFECTS OF ETHYL ACETATE EXTRACTION FROM GASTRODIA ELATA BLUME ON BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER IN FOCAL CEREBRAL ISCHEMIA REPERFUSION","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/protective-effects-ethyl-acetate-extraction-gastrodia-elata-blume-bloodbrain-barrier-focal-cerebral"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454083,"mean":7.1051250224367,"rank":4517974,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2355224,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454083,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175181,"mean":12.479427366138,"rank":95737,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":61799,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175181,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":217,"mean":2.5842222222222,"rank":73,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":125,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":217,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/bbbpapers\/statuses\/903203733130981378","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24564531],"posted_on":"2017-08-31T10:32:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Blood brain barrier","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/440531504972578816\/fylYz-PG_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #bbb papers in #PubMed.
