Crystallinity is another major controlling factor for materials properties. Although other Group-14 elements silicon and germanium have complementary crystalline and amorphous forms consisting of purely sp (3) bonds, purely sp (3)-bonded tetrahedral amorphous carbon has not yet been obtained. In this letter, we combine high pressure and in situ laser heating techniques to convert glassy carbon into \"quenchable amorphous diamond\", and recover it to ambient conditions. Our X-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and electron energy-loss spectroscopy experiments on the recovered sample and computer simulations confirm its tetrahedral amorphous structure and complete sp (3) bonding. This transparent quenchable amorphous diamond has, to our knowledge, the highest density among amorphous carbon materials, and shows incompressibility comparable to crystalline diamond.Diamond's properties are dictated by its crystalline, fully tetrahedrally bonded structure. Here authors synthesize a bulk sp (3)-bonded amorphous form of carbon under high pressure and temperature, show that it has bulk modulus comparable to crystalline diamond and that it can be recovered under ambient conditions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Zhidan Zeng","Liuxiang Yang","Qiaoshi Zeng","Hongbo Lou","Hongwei Sheng","Jianguo Wen","Dean J.
