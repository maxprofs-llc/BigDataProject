In an effort to understand the evolutionary origins of this multilateral system, we investigated bacteria isolated from fungi. One bacterial strain (Streptomyces sp. CLI2509) from the bracket fungus Hymenochaete rubiginosa, produced an unusual peptide, tryptorubin A, which contains heteroaromatic links between side chains that give it a rigid polycyclic globular structure. The three-dimensional structure was determined by NMR and MS, including a 13C-13C COSY of isotopically enriched material, degradation, derivatives, and computer modeling. Whole genome sequencing identified the biosynthetic genes responsible for tryptorubin A's linear hexapeptide backbone. The genome also revealed the close relationship between CLI2509 and Streptomyces sp. SPB78, which was previously implicated in an insect-bacterium symbiosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Wyche, Thomas P","Ruzzini, Antonio C.","Schwab, Laura","Currie, Cameron R","Clardy, Jon"],"doi":"10.1021\/jacs.7b06176","first_seen_on":"2017-08-31T10:02:52+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms"],"handles":[],"issns":["0002-7863","1520-5126"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1504175203,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28853867?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28853867","pubdate":"2017-08-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society (ACS)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Tryptorubin A, a polycyclic peptide from a fungus-derived Streptomycete","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tryptorubin-polycyclic-peptide-fungusderived-streptomycete"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":1.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454083,"mean":7.1051250224367,"rank":4017981,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4248363,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454083,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175180,"mean":12.479502029353,"rank":79240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":90614,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175180,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19371,"mean":5.3222196179659,"rank":12186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":6801,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19371,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208,"mean":9.8994396135266,"rank":146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":58,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
