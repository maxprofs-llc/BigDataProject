A combination of low and high fidelity simulators has been used with varying degrees of 'realism' provided by them. In this review, we discuss low and high fidelity simulators used for ureteroscopy (URS) and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) stone procedures with their advantages, disadvantages and future direction for endourological simulation surgery. The final goal will be to understand whether or not 'realism' has to be considered as a critical element in simulation for this field.\nThere is a wide range of simulators available for URS and PCNL training ranging from basic bench-type model to advanced virtual reality and cadaveric models, all providing various levels of realism. Although basic models might be more useful to novices, advanced models allow for complex and more realistic simulation training.\nWith a wide variety of simulators now available and given the latest novelties in modular training curriculums, combination of low and high fidelity simulators that provide a realistic and cost-effective option seems to be the way forward. It is unavoidable that simulators will play an increasing role in endourological training.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007077","authors":["Sarmah, Piyush","Voss, Jim","Ho, Adrian","Veneziano, Domenico","Somani, Bhaskar"],"doi":"10.1097\/mou.0000000000000401","first_seen_on":"2017-08-31T11:31:10+00:00","issns":["0963-0643"],"issue":"4","journal":"Current Opinion in Urology","last_mentioned_on":1504179036,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-urology\/Abstract\/2017\/07000\/Low_vs__high_fidelity___the_importance_of.3.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/co-urology\/2017\/07000\/Low_vs__high_fidelity___the_importance_of.3.pdf","pmid":"28403125","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"316","title":"Low vs. high fidelity","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-urology\/Fulltext\/2017\/07000\/Low_vs__high_fidelity___the_importance_of.3.aspx","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/low-vs-high-fidelity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454083,"mean":7.1051250224367,"rank":6414608,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1149431,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454083,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175181,"mean":12.479437355863,"rank":124048,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":31965,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175181,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":480,"mean":1.9478162839248,"rank":231,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":480,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":2.4714285714286,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CO_Urology\/statuses\/903218460708167680","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24566568],"posted_on":"2017-08-31T11:30:36+00:00","author":{"name":"CO Urology","url":"http:\/\/www.co-urology.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1706291245\/MOU_square_cover_normal.jpg","description":"Provides powerful perspectives on the most important advances in published literature, delivering expert assessments of developments from the previous year.","id_on_source":"CO_Urology","tweeter_id":"368390845","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":230},"tweet_id":"903218460708167680"}]}}
