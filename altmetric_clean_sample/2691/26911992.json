Because of their modulatory effects on ruminal fermentation, phytogenic compounds (PHY) and autolyzed yeast derivatives (AY) may alleviate the negative consequences of high-concentrate diets. Therefore, this research investigated if chewing behavior and the reticular pH dynamics are modulated by AY and PHY supplementation during repeated concentrate-rich challenges used to simulate intermittent rumen acidotic insults. Eight rumen-cannulated, dry, and nonpregnant Holstein cows were assigned to an incomplete double 4 \u00d7 3 Latin square design with 3 treatments and 4 experimental runs (n = 8\/treatment). Cows were fed concentrates either not supplemented (CON) or supplemented with PHY or AY. Initially, cows were fed a pure forage diet (FD) and switched to a 65% concentrate diet on DM basis for 1 (CONC 1) and 2 (CONC 2) wk. Between CONC 1 and CONC 2, the cows were fed the FD for 1 wk. Chewing activity was measured using noseband sensors and reticular pH by wireless pH sensors. Data showed that cows spent less time ruminating in CONC 1 than in CONC 2. In agreement, reticular pH drop was more pronounced during CONC 1 than during CONC 2. Cows fed with PHY spent 4 h less with reticular pH <6.0 during CONC 1 and 3 h less with pH <6.0 h in CONC 2 as compared with CON cows. Similarly, PHY supplementation extended rumination time with 88 min\/d compared with CON cows during CONC 1. The AY supplementation increased DMI by 20% resulting in a longer eating time compared with CON diet during CONC 1. Enhancement of ruminating by PHY and eating time by AY supplementation resulted in longer total chewing time for PHY (474 min\/d) and AY (466 min\/d) as compared with CON (356 min\/d) in CONC 1. In conclusion, cows experiencing 2 intermittent concentrate-rich challenges increased their ruminating behavior during the second challenge, and this effect was associated with higher reticular pH readings. The PHY supplementation enhanced rumination as well as reticular pH during CONC 1. However, the enhanced pH of cows fed with PHY during CONC 2 was not related to greater rumination, suggesting that influencing factors beyond rumination seemed to play a role in modulating reticular pH in PHY cows during CONC 2. The AY supplementation increased DMI without depressing rumination or reticular pH. Effects of both feed additives were more pronounced during CONC 1 challenge when reticular pH was lower.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d4a","authors":["I. Kr\u00f6ger","E. Humer","V.
