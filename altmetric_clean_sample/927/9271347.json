The authors report a novel mutation which led to HGprt-related neurological dysfunction (HND) in two brothers from the same family with a missense mutation in exon 6 of the coding region of the HPRT1 gene: c.437T>C, p.L146S. Molecular diagnosis discloses the genetic heterogeneity of the HPRT1 gene responsible for HGprt deficiency. It allows fast, accurate carrier detection and genetic counseling.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d63cf058f6100010a0","authors":["Nguyen, Khue Vu","Nyhan, William L"],"doi":"10.1080\/15257770.2015.1098660","endpage":"9","first_seen_on":"2016-07-06T10:22:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-2335","1525-7770"],"issue":"8","journal":"Nucleosides, Nucleotides and Nucleic Acids","last_mentioned_on":1467800491,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27379977?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27379977","pubdate":"2016-07-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Mutation in the Human HPRT1 Gene and the Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mutation-human-hprt1-gene-leschnyhan-syndrome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8002013,"mean":6.750266627688,"rank":6924570,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8002013,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260070,"mean":11.521483044884,"rank":218502,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260070,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96,"mean":1.9142947368421,"rank":79,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Calibr8YourLife\/statuses\/750635781761470464","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9271347],"posted_on":"2016-07-06T10:21:31+00:00","author":{"name":"Calibr8 Your Life","url":"http:\/\/www.calibr8yourlife.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/628313932449476608\/nvT6L_50_normal.jpg","description":"Helping to create awareness and healing through sharing of holistic health technologies and information.","id_on_source":"Calibr8YourLife","tweeter_id":"3266197364","geo":{"lt":37.25022,"ln":-119.75126,"country":"US"},"followers":640},"tweet_id":"750635781761470464"}]}}
