Disease pathophysiology is complex and not yet fully understood. Higher gene expression of ITPR2, encoding the IP3 receptor 2 (IP3R2), was detected in sporadic ALS patients. Here, we demonstrate that IP3R2 gene expression was also increased in spinal cords of ALS mice. Moreover, an increase of IP3R2 expression was observed in other models of chronic and acute neurodegeneration. Upregulation of IP3R2 gene expression could be induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in murine astrocytes, murine macrophages and human fibroblasts indicating that it may be a compensatory response to inflammation. Preventing this response by genetic deletion of Itpr2 from SOD1(G93A) mice had a dose-dependent effect on disease duration, resulting in a significantly shorter lifespan of these mice. In addition, the absence of IP3R2 led to increased innate immunity, which may contribute to the decreased survival of the SOD1(G93A) mice. Besides systemic inflammation, IP3R2 knockout mice also had increased IFN\u03b3, IL-6 and IL1\u03b1 expression. Altogether, our data indicate that IP3R2 protects against the negative effects of inflammation, suggesting that the increase in IP3R2 expression in ALS patients is a protective response.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f61000767c","authors":["Staats, Kim A","Humblet-Baron, Stephanie","Bento-Abreu, Andre","Scheveneels, Wendy","Nikolaou, Alexandros","Deckers, Kato","Lemmens, Robin","Goris, An","Van Ginderachter, Jo A","Van Damme, Philip","Hisatsune, Chihiro","Mikoshiba, Katsuhiko","Liston, Adrian","Robberecht, Wim","Van Den Bosch, Ludo","Kim A.
