HRV data were collected daily among eight Single-A level professional baseball starting pitchers (mean \u00b1 SD, age = 21.9 \u00b1 1.3 yrs; height = 185.4 \u00b1 3.6 cm; weight = 85.2 \u00b1 7.5 kg) throughout the entire baseball season with the participant quietly lying supine for 10 minutes. HRV was quantified by calculating the natural log of the square root of the mean sum of the squared differences (lnRMSSD) during the middle five minutes of each R-R series data file. A split-plot repeated measures ANOVA was used to examine the influence of pitching rotation day on resting lnRMSSD. A statistically significant main effect of rotation day was identified (F4,706 = 3.139, p = 0.029). Follow-up pairwise analyses indicated that resting lnRMSSD on Day 2 was significantly (p \u2264 0.05) lower than all other rotation days. In addition, a statistically significant main effect of pitcher was also identified (F7,706 = 83.388, p < 0.001). These results suggest that professional baseball starting pitchers display altered autonomic nervous system function one day after completing a normally scheduled start, as Day 2 resting HRV was significantly lower than all other rotation days. In addition, the season average resting lnRMSSD varied among participants, implying that single-subject analysis of resting measures of HRV may be more appropriate when monitoring cumulative workload among this cohort population of athletes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f6100040e2","authors":["Cornell, David J","Paxson, Jeffrey L","Caplinger, Roger A","Seligman, Joshua R","Davis, Nicholas
