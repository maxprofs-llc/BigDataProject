Commonly, these questions relate to the outcome and survival of dental treatments. Errors in indexing and inconsistencies in descriptions of these studies have meant that such articles are difficult to locate. To help address this problem, sensitive, precise and optimized electronic search strategies have been developed, and this article aims to explain how these new strategies can be used. These electronic search strategies have been shown to improve the identification of dental survival analyses.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f6100059b1","authors":["Layton, Danielle M"],"first_seen_on":"2017-03-17T06:15:58+00:00","issns":["0893-2174"],"issue":"2","journal":"International Journal of Prosthodontics","last_mentioned_on":1489730460,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26929950"],"pmid":"26929950","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"How to Find Dental Survival Articles: Using the New Search Strategies.","type":"article","volume":"29"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372629,"mean":7.0578283965246,"rank":1666306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6670376,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372629,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":265968,"mean":13.109266570664,"rank":73336,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":192265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":265968,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":1.8007021276596,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":79,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Rigid and non-rigid connections between implants and teeth: biological and technical complications.","url":"https:\/\/www.nationalelfservice.net\/dentistry\/restorative-dentistry\/rigid-non-rigid-connections-between-implants-teeth\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[9719813,14911386,17560172,417935,17560177,2305801,486165,3291107,1190553,4255014],"posted_on":"2017-03-17T06:01:00+00:00","summary":"Mark-Steven Howe assesses a systematic review looking at the impact of  rigid and non-rigid connectors between natural teeth and implants on the biological, functional and\/or the prosthetic complication rates.
