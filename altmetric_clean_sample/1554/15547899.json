However, the femtosecond capsulorhexis may not be as strong as a manual rhexis. Laser-induced miosis is also a potential disadvantage.\nThere may be increased surgeon confidence and patient satisfaction with FLACS and it may be friendlier to the internal structures of the eye. However, it is not superior to manual phacoemulsification in terms of primary outcomes such as visual and refractive outcomes or overall complications. Further refinements in technology may be needed to give it distinct advantages over manual phacoemulsification and to make it the norm in cataract surgery.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005866","authors":["Agarwal, Ashvin","Jacob, Soosan"],"doi":"10.1097\/icu.0000000000000333","endpage":"57","first_seen_on":"2017-01-17T17:00:25+00:00","issns":["1531-7021","1040-8738"],"issue":"1","journal":"Current opinion in ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1484672402,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-ophthalmology\/Abstract\/2017\/01000\/Current_and_effective_advantages_of_femto.10.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/co-ophthalmology\/2017\/01000\/Current_and_effective_advantages_of_femto.10.pdf","pmid":"27801688","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"49\u201357","subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Current and effective advantages of femto phacoemulsification","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-ophthalmology\/Fulltext\/2017\/01000\/Current_and_effective_advantages_of_femto.10.aspx","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/current-effective-advantages-femto-phacoemulsification"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8078137,"mean":6.8589454589436,"rank":6993301,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8078137,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257826,"mean":12.858957308251,"rank":212992,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257826,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":542,"mean":2.4951164510166,"rank":485,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":542,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":0.88478260869565,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":7,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ProfOculista\/statuses\/821401708270129157","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15547899],"posted_on":"2017-01-17T17:00:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Professione Oculista","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/536891307445088256\/tV4xeFVM_normal.png","description":"#AggiornamentoProfessionale per Medici #Oculisti.\nCorso #ECM #ProfessioneOculista accreditato dal #MinisteroDellaSalute 36 crediti in modalit\u00e0 #FAD.","id_on_source":"ProfOculista","tweeter_id":"2396396083","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":364},"tweet_id":"821401708270129157"}]}}
