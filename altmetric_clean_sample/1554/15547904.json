Uncorrected and corrected distance visual acuity, mean refractive spherical equivalent (MRSE), and mean keratometry and aberrations (total, higher order [HOA], coma, trefoil, and spherical aberration) were recorded at months 3 and 6 postoperatively, as were complications and attempted versus achieved MRSE.\nThirty-three eyes of 25 patients who underwent PRK post-LASIK (21 eyes of 14 patients for hPRK-PL and 12 eyes of 11 patients for mPRK-PL) and 35 eyes of 21 patients who underwent PRK on virgin eyes (11 eyes of 8 patients for hPRK and 24 eyes of 13 patients for mPRK) were included in the study. The only significant differences in outcomes were found to be HOA at 3 months for hPRK-PL as compared with both hPRK and mPRK. Achieved MRSE was significantly different from expected MRSE for hPRK-PL at 3 months postoperatively. No haze- or flap-related complications were observed.\nOutcomes of PRK were not different in myopic and hyperopic corrections post-LASIK by 6 months or when compared with PRK in virgin eyes. HOA may render hPRK-PL results less predictable early in the postoperative period.","altmetric_jid":"5216117e3cf058827c00005b","authors":["Alfonso Iovieno","Joshua C.
