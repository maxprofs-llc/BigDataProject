The purpose of this study was to determine the inter- and intra-rater reliabilities of the assessment of FHP. [Subjects and Methods] We recruited 45 participants (20 male subjects, 25 female subjects) from a university student population. Two physical therapists assessed FHP using images of head extension. FHP is characterized by the measurement of angles and distances between anatomical landmarks. Forward shoulder angle of 54\u00b0 or less was defined as FHP. Intra- and inter-rater reliabilities were estimated using Kendall's Taub correlation coefficients. [Results] Intra-class correlation of intra-rater measurements indicated an excellent level of reliability (0.91), and intra-class correlation of inter-rater measurements showed a good level of reliability in the assessment of FHP (0.75). [Conclusion] Assessment of FHP is an important component of evaluation and affects the design of the treatment regimen. The assessment of FHP was reliably measured by two physical therapists. It could therefore become a useful method for assessing FHP in the clinical setting. Future studies will be needed to provide more detailed quantitative data for accurate assessment of posture.","abstract_source":"pubmed","authors":["Nam SH","Son SM","Kwon JW","Lee NK"],"doi":"10.1589\/jpts.25.737","first_seen_on":"2014-03-04T21:12:19+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"6","journal":"J Phys Ther Sci","last_mentioned_on":1393967524,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24259842"],"pmid":"24259842","pubdate":"2013-11-23T00:00:00+00:00","title":"The Intra- and Inter-rater Reliabilities of the Forward Head Posture Assessment of Normal Healthy Subjects.","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intra-interrater-reliabilities-forward-head-posture-assessment-normal-healthy-subjects"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
