This is dependent on CD4(+)CXCR5(+) follicular helper T cells (TFH) and inhibited by CD4(+)CXCR5(+)Foxp3(+) follicular regulatory T cells (TFR). Because NFAT2 was found to be highly expressed and activated in follicular T cells, we addressed its function herein. Unexpectedly, ablation of NFAT2 in T cells caused an augmented GC reaction upon immunization. Consistently, however, TFR cells were clearly reduced in the follicular T cell population due to impaired homing to B cell follicles. This was TFR-intrinsic because only in these cells NFAT2 was essential to up-regulate CXCR5. The physiological relevance for humoral (auto-)immunity was corroborated by exacerbated lupuslike disease in the presence of NFAT2-deficient TFR cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c77","authors":["Martin Vaeth","Gerd M\u00fcller","Dennis Stauss","Lena Dietz","Stefan Klein-Hessling","Edgar Serfling","Martin Lipp","Ingolf Berberich","Friederike Berberich-Siebelt"],"doi":"10.1084\/jem.20130604","first_seen_on":"2014-03-05T09:55:50+00:00","issns":["1540-9538"],"journal":"The Journal of Experimental Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1409875200,"links":["http:\/\/jem.rupress.org\/content\/early\/2014\/02\/25\/jem.20130604.long","http:\/\/jem.rupress.org\/content\/211\/3\/545.short?rss=1","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1084\/jem.20130604"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jem.rupress.org\/content\/early\/2014\/02\/25\/jem.20130604.full.pdf","pmid":"24590764","publisher":"Rockefeller Univ Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["medicine","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Follicular regulatory T cells control humoral autoimmunity via NFAT2-regulated CXCR5 expression","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/follicular-regulatory-t-cells-control-humoral-autoimmunity-via-nfat2regulated-cxcr5-expression"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992937,"mean":6.7399601605663,"rank":3723942,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":4090349,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992937,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174408,"mean":7.7135686296997,"rank":69901,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":99058,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174408,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3771,"mean":6.8768339522546,"rank":2414,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1285,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3771,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":15.383153846154,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
