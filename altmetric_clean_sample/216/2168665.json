A total of 176 cases of aortic amyloidosis was found for an average incidence of 79%. Under the 5th decade the incidence was 51% and it rose sharply with age and reached 95% in over the 8th decade. The incidence of cardiac amyloidosis also increased with age, but it was always higher in the aorta. Aortic and cardiac amyloid were both positive in the DMAB method for tryptophan. The major part exposed to amyloidosis in the aorta was the media. The medial amyloid consisted of numerous minute deposits and had no relation to atherosclerosis. Some comments about the pathogenesis of senile amyloidosis were also mentioned.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9243cf058f61000dbb3","authors":["T Iwata","T Kamei","F Uchino","H Mimaya","T Yanagaki","H Etoh"],"first_seen_on":"2014-03-07T07:05:29+00:00","issns":["0001-6632"],"issue":"2","journal":"Acta pathologica japonica","last_mentioned_on":1394175907,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/676743"],"pmid":"676743","pubdate":"1978-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Pathological study on amyloidosis--relationship of amyloid deposits in the aorta to aging.","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pathological-study-amyloidosis-relationship-amyloid-deposits-aorta-aging"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3624912,"mean":4.93425642237,"rank":2906010,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":72679,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3624912,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94458,"mean":7.3721423716613,"rank":74998,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":222,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94458,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":3.0111111111111,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Pathological study on amyloidosis--relations...
