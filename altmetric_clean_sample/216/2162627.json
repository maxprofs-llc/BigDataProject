Citral, linalool and estragole were the major constituents. Citral, the major contributor to the lemony flavour, was significantly higher in post-flowering (79%) and full-flowering (65%), it was reduced to 42% at pre-flowering. Linalool was consistent throughout the growth cycle (2-3%). Estragole was higher in pre-flowering representing 15% of the total volatiles present. Linalool levels dropped sharply during the full-flowering and post-flowering stages to 2% and 0.4%, respectively. Volatiles from different parts of lemon basil were evaluated to determine the parts that influence the flavour. The percentage composition of citral for leaves and flowers was 64.5% and 58% for the branches. Linalool was much higher in flowers (13%), followed by 11% in branches and 3% in leaves. The flavour attributes of lemon basil infusions can be improved by incorporating aerial branches and flowers in the tea.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028f5","doi":"10.1016\/j.foodchem.2013.12.001","first_seen_on":"2014-03-05T03:22:09+00:00","issns":["03088146"],"journal":"Food Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1393968653,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0308814613018566"],"pmid":"24444959","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"title":"The relationship between growth stages and aroma composition of lemon basil Ocimum citriodorum Vis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/relationship-between-growth-stages-aroma-composition-lemon-basil-ocimum-citriodorum-vis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6228730,"mean":5.9649848381607,"rank":4606276,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":935402,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6228730,"percentile":15},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":131974,"mean":8.6265132261903,"rank":88538,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":23859,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":131974,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2773,"mean":3.2639675324675,"rank":1554,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":814,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2773,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":3.0466222222222,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
