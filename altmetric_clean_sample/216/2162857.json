The main important thermodynamic and kinetic parameters, such as solubility and interfacial tension of PCL in water-acetone mixtures, are determined and the effect of the process operating conditions on the final particle size distribution is also investigated. Particles produced under different conditions into a Confined Impinging Jets Reactor (CIJR) were characterized by Dynamic Light Scattering, Zeta potential measurements and Scanning Electronic Microscopy. Results clearly show the strong effect of mixing on the particle size distribution and how mixing must be controlled in order to obtain a product with particular characteristics. Eventually the measured thermodynamic and kinetic parameters are used to interpret the obtained experimental data.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d15","doi":"10.1016\/j.jcis.2008.03.033","first_seen_on":"2014-03-05T05:12:19+00:00","issns":["00219797"],"journal":"Journal of Colloid & Interface Science","last_mentioned_on":1393996315,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0021979708003159?np=y"],"pmid":"18402975","pubdate":"2008-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"title":"Strategies to control the particle size distribution of poly-\u03b5-caprolactone nanoparticles for pharmaceutical applications","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/strategies-control-particle-size-distribution-polycaprolactone-nanoparticles-pharmaceutical-applicat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628651,"mean":4.9397870194191,"rank":2902671,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":76688,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628651,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94970,"mean":7.5008917857408,"rank":75272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":324,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94970,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":365,"mean":1.5794120879121,"rank":200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":365,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.1666666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
