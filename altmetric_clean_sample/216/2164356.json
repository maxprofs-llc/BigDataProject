The concentrations of \u03a319PBDE ranged from 4.01 to 10,400\u00a0ng\/g dry weight. The average \u03a319PBDE concentrations in industrial, domestic wastewater, and livestock sludge were 1,560\u2009\u00b1\u20093,610, 402\u2009\u00b1\u2009148, and 27.6\u2009\u00b1\u200950.4\u00a0ng\/g dry weight, respectively. The composition of PBDEs differed according to the type of sludge. Among the PBDE congeners, BDE 209 was dominant in all sludge samples. After BDE 209, relatively high levels were found for BDE 28 and 47 from industrial sludge, BDE 47 and 99 from domestic wastewater sludge, and BDE 206, 207, and 208 from livestock sludge. Using hierarchical cluster analysis, sludges were divided into three groups according to PBDE congener composition. A risk assessment of PBDEs in sludge used for soil amendment was carried out. Preliminary results indicated that the potential risk of soil exposed to PBDEs in sludge was relatively low.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f61000653d","authors":["Hyo Jin Lee","Chang Joon Kim","Gi Hoon Hong","Sang Hee Hong","Won Joon Shim","Gi Beum Kim"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11356-014-2664-7","first_seen_on":"2014-03-05T18:21:53+00:00","issns":["1614-7499"],"journal":"Environmental Science & Pollution Research","last_mentioned_on":1394034713,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24590600"],"pmid":"24590600","pubdate":"2014-03-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Atmospheric Protection\/Air Quality Control\/Air Pollution","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ecotoxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Waste Water Technology \/ Water Pollution Control \/ Water Management \/ Aquatic Pollution","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Congener-specific accumulation and environmental risk assessment of polybrominated diphenyl ethers in diverse Korean sewage sludge types.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/congenerspecific-accumulation-environmental-risk-assessment-polybrominated-diphenyl-ethers-diverse-k"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6230816,"mean":5.9681228064084,"rank":5295542,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6230816,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":131970,"mean":8.629890625829,"rank":108147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":131970,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1549,"mean":2.0965180878553,"rank":891,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1549,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":1.1558139534884,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Environmental Science":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"KR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Loose_Lab_Rat\/status\/441239683847434240","license":"public","citation_ids":[2164356],"posted_on":"2014-03-05T15:51:53+00:00","author":{"name":"Kelly A.
