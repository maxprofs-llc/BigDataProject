Unveiling molecular mechanisms that render these cells proinflammatory is important for the design of specific immunotherapies. In this report, we demonstrated that mesenteric lymph node CD103(-) DCs express, among other proinflammatory cytokines, high levels of osteopontin (Opn) during experimental colitis. Opn expression by CD103(-) DCs was crucial for their immune profile and pathogenicity, including induction of T helper (Th) 1 and Th17 cell responses. Adoptive transfer of Opn-deficient CD103(-) DCs resulted in attenuated colitis in comparison to transfer of WT CD103(-) DCs, whereas transgenic CD103(-) DCs that overexpress Opn were highly pathogenic in vivo. Neutralization of secreted Opn expressed exclusively by CD103(-) DCs restrained disease severity. Also, Opn deficiency resulted in milder disease, whereas systemic neutralization of secreted Opn was therapeutic. We determined a specific domain of the Opn protein responsible for its CD103(-) DC-mediated proinflammatory effect. We demonstrated that disrupting the interaction of this Opn domain with integrin \u03b19, overexpressed on colitic CD103(-) DCs, suppressed the inflammatory potential of these cells in vitro and in vivo. These results add unique insight into the biology of CD103(-) DCs and their function during inflammatory bowel disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Evangelia Kourepini","Maria Aggelakopoulou","Themis Alissafi","Nikolaos Paschalidis","Davina C.
