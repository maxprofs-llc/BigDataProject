Secondary causes have been associated with IIH, but the pathogenesis is poorly understood, and most cases are idiopathic. We present a case of IIH after suboptimal surgical stabilization of a traumatic C5 spinal cord injury, American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale grade A. The patient underwent a posterior arthrodesis and fusion to stabilize the spine, and his symptoms gradually resolved. To our knowledge, we present the first reported case of intracranial hypertension after a traumatic spinal cord injury and failed surgical stabilization.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008551","authors":["Sussman, Walter I.","Shaw, Erik"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pmrj.2013.08.595","first_seen_on":"2014-03-05T00:18:59+00:00","issns":["1934-1482"],"journal":"PM&R","last_mentioned_on":1393955162,"links":["http:\/\/www.pmrjournal.org\/article\/S1934-1482(13)01020-4\/abstract?rss=yes"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pmrjournal.org\/article\/S1934-1482(13)01020-4\/pdf","pmid":"24361119","publisher":"Elsevier","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine"],"title":"Intracranial Hypertension After Spinal Cord Injury and Suboptimal Cervical Fusion","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intracranial-hypertension-after-spinal-cord-injury-suboptimal-cervical-fusion"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6228670,"mean":5.9649392979483,"rank":4606266,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":935408,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6228670,"percentile":15},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":131974,"mean":8.6264473036153,"rank":88537,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":23861,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":131974,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":657,"mean":3.6186067073171,"rank":497,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":67,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":657,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":2.6266666666667,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
