They are important mediators of intercellular communication and act on the adjacent stroma as well as in the periphery. Recently, exosomes have been recognized to play a pathophysiological role in various diseases such as cancer or infectious diseases. Tumor cell-derived exosomes (Tex) have been shown to act as tumor promotors by educating non-malignant cells to provide a tumor supporting microenvironment, which helps to circumvent immune detection by the host and supports metastasis. However, Tex with anti-tumor, immune-activating properties were also described reflecting the complexity of exosomes. Here, we assess the role of extracellular microvesicles\/exosomes as messengers affecting NK cell function in health and disease and discuss the molecular basis for the differential impact of exosomes on NK cell activity. The molecular composition\/load of exosomes and the mechanisms regulating their release remain unclear and need to be further analyzed to facilitate the development of new treatment options targeting the exosomal machinery.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90c3cf058f61000cb02","authors":["Reiners, Katrin S.","Dassler, Juliane","Coch, Christoph","Pogge Von Strandmann, Elke"],"doi":"10.3389\/fimmu.2014.00091","first_seen_on":"2014-03-07T09:38:34+00:00","issns":["","1664-3224"],"journal":"Frontiers in immunology","last_mentioned_on":1395224048,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fimmu.2014.00091\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24639679?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Article\/DownloadFile\/18287\/FLPDF\/fimmu-05-00091.pdf\/461","pmcid":"PMC3945280","pmid":"24639679","pubdate":"2014-02-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Role of Exosomes Released by Dendritic Cells and\/or by Tumor Targets: Regulation of NK Cell Plasticity","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-exosomes-released-dendritic-cells-andor-tumor-targets-regulation-nk-cell-plasticity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7750516,"mean":6.6309473476215,"rank":5863612,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1044682,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7750516,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173390,"mean":7.6734587545926,"rank":112137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":30987,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173390,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3171,"mean":2.5481331230284,"rank":2249,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":668,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3171,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143,"mean":1.9592253521127,"rank":95,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
