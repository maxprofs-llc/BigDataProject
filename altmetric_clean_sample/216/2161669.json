A total of 153 children diagnosed with JMML were reported to the Myelodysplastic Syndrome Committee in Japan between 1989 and 2007; 15 of them (9\u00b78%) had 20% or more blasts in the bone marrow (blast crisis) during the disease course. Blast crisis occurred during observation without therapy (n\u00a0=\u00a03) or with oral 6-mercaptopurine treatment (n\u00a0=\u00a09) and in relapse after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT; n\u00a0=\u00a03). Six patients had a complex karyotype (5 including monosomy 7) and an additional three patients had isolated monosomy 7 at blast crisis. Seven patients received HSCT after blast crisis and four of them achieved remission. Eleven out of the 15 patients died; the cause of death was disease progression in 10 patients and transplant-related complication in one patient. In summary, patients with blast crisis have poor prognosis and can be cured only by HSCT. The emergence of monosomy 7 and complex karyotype may be characteristic of blast crisis in a substantial subset of children.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002446","authors":["Honda, Yuko","Tsuchida, Masahiro","Zaike, Yuji","Masunaga, Atsuko","Yoshimi, Ayami","Kojima, Seiji","Ito, Masafumi","Kikuchi, Akira","Nakahata, Tatsutoshi","Manabe, Atsushi"],"doi":"10.1111\/bjh.12796","endpage":"687","first_seen_on":"2014-03-04T20:03:34+00:00","issns":["1365-2141","0007-1048"],"issue":"5","journal":"British Journal of Haematology","last_mentioned_on":1393963403,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/bjh.12796\/abstract;jsessionid=DCA04A4E34F91F5F7CB75F90B8679566.f03t04"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/bjh.12796\/pdf","pmid":"24588411","pubdate":"2014-03-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"682","subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Clinical characteristics of 15 children with juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia who developed blast crisis: MDS Committee of Japanese Society of Paediatric Haematology\/Oncology","type":"article","volume":"165","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-characteristics-15-children-juvenile-myelomonocytic-leukaemia-developed-blast-crisis-mds-co"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6302087,"mean":5.9763426049732,"rank":2961591,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1885715,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6302087,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":139095,"mean":8.3737640157018,"rank":69683,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":51710,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":139095,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1424,"mean":2.5763274771609,"rank":781,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":461,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1424,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":1.75448,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
