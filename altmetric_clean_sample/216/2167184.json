A 200 cm long narrow glass column containing aqueous solution of standard\/sample was used to increase phase transfer ratio by providing more contact area between two medium (aqueous and extractive), which drastically improve the recoveries of labile hydrophobic chelate of Cd ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (APDC), into ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate [C4mim][PF6]. Different aspect of the desire method have been investigated and optimized. Under the optimized key experimental variables, limit of detection (LOD) and enhancement factor (EF) were achieved to be 0.5 ng L(-1) and 150, respectively. Reliability of the model method was checked by relative standard deviation (%RSD), which was found to be <5%. Validity and accuracy of the developed method was checked by analysis of certified reference water samples (SLRS-4 Riverine water) using standard addition method. Application of the model method was productively performed by analysis of Cd in real surface water samples (tap and sea).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002249","doi":"10.1016\/j.aca.2013.12.034","first_seen_on":"2014-03-06T18:46:03+00:00","issns":["00032670"],"journal":"Analytica Chimica Acta","last_mentioned_on":1394131543,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0003267013015833"],"pmid":"24491765","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Development of a new green non-dispersive ionic liquid microextraction method in a narrow glass column for determination of cadmium prior to couple with graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-new-green-nondispersive-ionic-liquid-microextraction-method-narrow-glass-column-determin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3061052,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":940508,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107659,"mean":8.3712877073699,"rank":72537,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":22580,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107659,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1063,"mean":1.4874011299435,"rank":493,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":242,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1063,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":0.73529411764706,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
