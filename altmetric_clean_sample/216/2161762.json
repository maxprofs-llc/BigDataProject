Our recent data demonstrate that hydrogen sulfide (H2S), the third gaseous transmitter, has a protective effect on the neurotoxicity of FA. However, the exact mechanisms underlying this protection remain largely unknown. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been implicated in the neurotoxicity of FA. Silent mating type information regulator 2 homolog 1 (SIRT-1), a histone deacetylases, has various biological activities, including the extension of lifespan, the modulation of ER stress, and the neuroprotective action.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Xiang Li","Kai-Yan Zhang","Ping Zhang","Li-Xun Chen","Li Wang","Ming Xie","Chun-Yan Wang","Xiao-Qing Tang"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0089856","first_seen_on":"2014-03-04T20:51:41+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"2","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1414528738,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0089856","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0089856","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0089856"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0089856.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3938548","pmid":"24587076","pubdate":"2014-02-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e89856","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Hydrogen Sulfide Inhibits Formaldehyde-Induced Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in PC12 Cells by Upregulation of SIRT-1","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hydrogen-sulfide-inhibits-formaldehydeinduced-endoplasmic-reticulum-stress-pc12-cells-upregulation-s"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7212630,"mean":6.3526471651285,"rank":2888368,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4292902,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7212630,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171001,"mean":7.5437212280704,"rank":57121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":112854,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171001,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104505,"mean":10.087784352752,"rank":42746,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":61113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104505,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5150,"mean":12.440482423772,"rank":2150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":2963,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5150,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
