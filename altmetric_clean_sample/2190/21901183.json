The purpose of this study was to identify correlates of ever having endoscopy screenings for CRC and to determine whether fatalism plays a unique role. Because evidence suggests that cancer-associated fatalistic beliefs may be particularly common among rural Americans, the study was conducted in a medically underserved area of rural Appalachia.\u00a0 METHODS: Rural residents (N = 260) between 51 and 75 years of age, from a medically underserved area of Appalachia, Kentucky, were recruited for a cross-sectional study. The outcome measure was assessed by a single item asking whether participants ever had a colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy. Demographic and health-related correlates of this outcome were selected based on past studies of rural populations. A single item assessed perceptions of fatalism regarding CRC. Age-adjusted analyses of correlates testing significant at the bivariate level were conducted.\u00a0 RESULTS: The analytic sample was limited to 135 rural residents indicating they had ever had CRC endoscopy and 107 indicating never having endoscopy. In age-adjusted analyses, only the measure of fatalism had a significant association with having endoscopy. Those endorsing the statement pertaining to fatalism were 2.3 times more likely (95% CI = 1.24-4.27, P = .008) than the remainder to indicate never having endoscopy.\u00a0 CONCLUSIONS: A community-based approach to the promotion of endoscopy for CRC screening could focus on overcoming CRC-associated fatalism, thereby potentially bringing more unscreened people to endoscopy clinics.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005aa7","authors":["Crosby, Richard A.","Collins, Tom"],"doi":"10.1111\/jrh.12257","first_seen_on":"2017-07-15T00:34:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0890-765X","1748-0361"],"journal":"Journal of Rural Health","last_mentioned_on":1500056461,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jrh.12257\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jrh.12257\/pdf","pmid":"28685889","pubdate":"2017-07-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Correlates of Community-Based Colorectal Cancer Screening in a Rural Population: The Role of Fatalism","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":1.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8208212,"mean":6.9507561304097,"rank":3878387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4147239,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8208212,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176749,"mean":11.414368875461,"rank":80385,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":90930,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176749,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":393,"mean":5.8771275510204,"rank":288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":97,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":393,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.9909090909091,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/infobendr\/statuses\/885864688055177216","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21901183],"posted_on":"2017-07-14T14:12:54+00:00","author":{"name":"Teresa McGinley","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/582274746110382081\/OfWpqlsu_normal.png","description":"#medlibs #publichealth #hsr information bender, mama, wife, bibliophile, baker, gamer...
