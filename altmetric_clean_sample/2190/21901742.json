Here, we show the mechanistic link between the endothelin-1 (ET-1)\/ET-1 receptor (ET-1R) signaling and \u03b2-catenin pathway through the specific interaction with the signal transducer \u03b2-arrestin1 (\u03b2-arr1), which initiates signaling cascades as part of the signaling complex. Using a panel of patient-derived CRC-SC, we show that these cells secrete ET-1 and express ETAR and \u03b2-arr1, and that the activation of ETAR\/\u03b2-arr1 axis promotes the cross-talk with \u03b2-catenin signaling to sustain stemness, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype and response to chemotherapy. Upon ETAR activation, \u03b2-arr1 acts as a transcription co-activator that binds \u03b2-catenin, thereby promoting nuclear complex with \u03b2-catenin\/TFC4 and p300 and histone acetylation, inducing chromatin reorganization on target genes, such as ET-1. The enhanced transcription of ET-1 increases the self-sustained ET-1\/\u03b2-catenin network. All these findings provide a strong rationale for targeting ET-1R to hamper downstream \u03b2-catenin\/ET-1 autocrine circuit. Interestingly, treatment with macitentan, a dual ETAR and ETBR antagonist, able to interfere with tumor and microenvironment, disrupts the ET-1R\/\u03b2-arr1-\u03b2-catenin interaction impairing pathways involved in cell survival, EMT, invasion, and enhancing sensitivity to oxaliplatin (OX) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). In CRC-SC xenografts, the combination of macitentan and OX or 5-FU enhances the therapeutic effects of cytotoxic drugs. Together, these results provide mechanistic insight into how ET-1R coopts \u03b2-catenin signaling and offer a novel therapeutic strategy to manage CRC based on the combination of macitentan and chemotherapy that might benefit patients whose tumors show high ETAR and \u03b2-catenin expression.Cell Death and Differentiation advance online publication, 14 July 2017; doi:10.1038\/cdd.2017.121.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c4","authors":["Roberta Cianfrocca","Laura Rosan\u00f2","Piera Tocci","Rosanna Sestito","Valentina Caprara","Valeriana Di Castro","Ruggero De Maria","Anna Bagnato","Cianfrocca, Roberta","Rosan\u00f2, Laura","Tocci, Piera","Sestito, Rosanna","Caprara, Valentina","Di Castro, Valeriana","De Maria, Ruggero","Bagnato, Anna"],"doi":"10.1038\/cdd.2017.121","endpage":"1820","first_seen_on":"2017-07-15T00:46:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1350-9047","1476-5403"," 1476-5403"],"journal":"Cell Death & Differentiation","last_mentioned_on":1505147937,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/cdd\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/cdd2017121a.html?WT.feed_name=subjects_cancer&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/cdd\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/cdd2017121a.html","http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/cdd\/rss\/aop\/~3\/3JA49IdrFeA\/cdd.2017.121","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28708138?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1038\/cdd.2017.121","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/cdd\/journal\/v24\/n10\/full\/cdd2017121a.html?foxtrotcallback=true"],"pmid":"28708138","pubdate":"2017-07-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cancer stem cells","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Epigenetics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1811","subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Blocking endothelin-1-receptor\/\u03b2-catenin circuit sensitizes to chemotherapy in colorectal cancer","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/blocking-endothelin1receptor%CE%B2catenin-circuit-sensitizes-chemotherapy-colorectal-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.25,"score_history":{"1y":10.25,"6m":10.25,"3m":10.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8397236,"mean":7.0723276090205,"rank":841138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7548534,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8397236,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228764,"mean":12.890223882358,"rank":36162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":192381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228764,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1150,"mean":5.6368772845953,"rank":160,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":969,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1150,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":4.4722641509434,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
