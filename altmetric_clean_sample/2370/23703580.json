Then the association between tissue\/serum miR-144 levels and clinicopathological parameters was determined.\nThe expression levels of miR-144 were significantly down-regulated in the cancerous tissue and serum samples from gastric cancer patients. Serum miR-144 was able to differentiate the gastric cancer patients from healthy controls with high accuracy. In addition, tissue and serum miR-144 levels were both associated with clinical stage and lymph node metastasis. Moreover, patients with lower tissue or serum miR-144 suffered worse 5\u00a0year overall survival and disease free survival.\nTaken together, our data support the potential clinical value of tissue and serum miR-144 as prognostic biomarkers in gastric cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5203cf058f610003a29","authors":["Liu, Suoning","Suo, Jian","Wang, Chunxi","Sun, Xuan","Wang, Daguang","He, Liang","Zhang, Yang","Li, Wei"],"doi":"10.3233\/cbm-170351","first_seen_on":"2017-08-12T23:11:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1875-8592","1574-0153"],"journal":"Cancer Biomarkers","last_mentioned_on":1502584121,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28800316?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28800316?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28800316","pubdate":"2017-08-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"IOS Press","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms","biochemistry"],"title":"Prognostic significance of low miR-144 expression in gastric cancer","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prognostic-significance-low-mir144-expression-gastric-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366012,"mean":7.0543497525808,"rank":6348571,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1134080,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366012,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":182666,"mean":12.472444321572,"rank":129037,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":33317,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":182666,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160,"mean":1.0467295597484,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":73,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":0.41071428571429,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/microRNA_papers\/statuses\/896509380752924672","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23703580],"posted_on":"2017-08-12T23:11:07+00:00","author":{"name":"microRNApapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/509340649733517312\/5SbSeX5X_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for microRNA papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ.
