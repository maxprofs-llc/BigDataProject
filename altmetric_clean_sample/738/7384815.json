By fine-tuning these properties, the hydrogels can be 3D bioprinted, to generate e.g. constructs for cartilage repair. This study investigated whether hydrogels based on the above mentioned polymer with a 10% degree of methacrylation (M10P10), support cartilage formation by chondrocytes, and whether the incorporation of methacrylated chondroitin sulfate (CSMA) or methacrylated hyaluronic acid (HAMA) can improve the mechanical properties, long-term stability, and printability. Chondrocyte-laden M10P10 hydrogels were cultured for 42 days to evaluate chondrogenesis. M10P10 hydrogels with or without polysaccharides were evaluated for their mechanical properties (before and after UV photo-cross-linking), degradation kinetics, and printability. Extensive cartilage matrix production occurred in M10P10 hydrogels, highlighting their potential for cartilage repair strategies. The incorporation of polysaccharides increased the storage modulus of polymer mixtures and decreased the degradation kinetics in cross-linked hydrogels. Addition of HAMA to M10P10 hydrogels improved printability and resulted in 3D constructs with excellent cell viability. Hence, this novel combination of M10P10 with HAMA forms an interesting class of hydrogels for cartilage bioprinting.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023e5","authors":["Anna Abbadessa","Abbadessa, Anna","Mouser, Vivian H M","Blokzijl, Maarten M","Gawlitta, Debby","Dhert, Wouter J A","Hennink, Wim E","Malda, Jos","Vermonden, Tina"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.biomac.6b00366","first_seen_on":"2016-05-13T16:04:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1525-7797","1526-4602"],"journal":"Biomacromolecules","last_mentioned_on":1464017210,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.biomac.6b00366?journalCode=bomaf6","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.biomac.6b00366","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27171342","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/acs.biomac.6b00366"],"pmid":"27171342","pubdate":"2016-05-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"A synthetic thermo-sensitive hydrogel for cartilage bioprinting and its biofunctionalization with polysaccharides","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthetic-thermosensitive-hydrogel-cartilage-bioprinting-biofunctionalization-polysaccharides"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.65,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.65},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7737442,"mean":6.6309810015932,"rank":646564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7090156,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7737442,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269509,"mean":11.431183786752,"rank":33721,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":235730,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269509,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":925,"mean":4.8247597402597,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":877,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":925,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":5.905,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
