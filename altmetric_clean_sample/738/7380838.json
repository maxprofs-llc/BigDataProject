The levels of microRNAs (miRNAs)-small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression, including genes involved in neuronal function and plasticity-are frequently altered in psychiatric disorders. This study aimed to examine changes in miRNA expression in bipolar mania patients after treatment with asenapine and risperidone. Using a miRNA microarray, we analyzed miRNA expression in the blood of 10 bipolar mania patients following 12 weeks of treatment with asenapine or risperidone. Selected miRNAs were validated by using real-time PCR. A total of 16 miRNAs were differentially expressed after treatment in the asenapine group, 14 of which were significantly upregulated and the other two significantly downregulated. However, all three differentially expressed miRNAs in the risperidone group were downregulated. MiRNA target gene prediction and gene ontology analysis revealed significant enrichment for pathways associated with immune system response and regulation of programmed cell death and transcription. Our results suggest that candidate miRNAs may be involved in the mechanism of action of both antipsychotics in bipolar mania. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f61000697e","authors":["Lim, Chor Hong","Zainal, Nor Zuraida","Kanagasundram, Sharmilla","Zain, Shamsul Mohd","Mohamed, Zahurin"],"doi":"10.1002\/ajmg.b.32457","endpage":"874","first_seen_on":"2016-05-13T15:18:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1552-485X"],"issue":"6","journal":"American Journal of Medical Genetics.
