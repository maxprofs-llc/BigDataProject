These adaptations are hypothesized to result in resilience in environments that match the early environment. As appraisal style is a putative target of adaptive programming, early experiences could be a distal cause of resilience.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023a1","authors":["Nederhof, Esther","Esther Nederhof"],"doi":"10.1017\/s0140525x14001654","first_seen_on":"2016-05-13T15:14:01+00:00","issns":["1469-1825","0140-525X"],"journal":"Behavioral & Brain Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1478925350,"links":["https:\/\/www.cambridge.org\/core\/journals\/behavioral-and-brain-sciences\/article\/phenotypic-programming-as-a-distal-cause-of-resilience\/51887E61D043C68146AF8F2639CE5DB7"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.cambridge.org\/core\/services\/aop-cambridge-core\/content\/view\/51887E61D043C68146AF8F2639CE5DB7\/S0140525X14001654a.pdf\/phenotypic-programming-as-a-distal-cause-of-resilience.pdf","pmid":"26785631","pubdate":"2015-09-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Artificial Intelligence And Image Processing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["brain","psychology","neurology"],"title":"Phenotypic programming as a distal cause of resilience","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.journals.cambridge.org\/abstract_S0140525X14001654","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phenotypic-programming-distal-cause-resilience"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7684314,"mean":6.5948576928038,"rank":5537025,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1872760,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7684314,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269010,"mean":11.422932333119,"rank":172721,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":80754,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269010,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1037,"mean":8.936552123552,"rank":603,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":384,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1037,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":9.5115333333333,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
