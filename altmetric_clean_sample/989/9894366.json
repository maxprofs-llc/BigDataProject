The photophysical properties of these complexes were explored in the solid state, in solutions, and in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix, which revealed their good potential as tunable solid state emitters. Some of these complexes acted as efficient catalysts for the transesterification of esters and canola oil showing their potential in biodiesel generation. Mechanistic investigations using ESI-MS revealed that the transesterification catalyzed by these complexes proceeds through two types of acyl intermediates.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Abhishek Kumar Gupta"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.6b00804","first_seen_on":"2016-07-20T17:06:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-510X"],"issue":"15","journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1469034251,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.6b00804"],"pmid":"27439021","pubdate":"2016-07-21T22:00:09+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Multifunctional Zn(II) Complexes: Photophysical Properties and Catalytic Transesterification toward Biodiesel Synthesis","type":"article","volume":"55","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multifunctional-znii-complexes-photophysical-properties-catalytic-transesteri-fi-cation-toward-biodi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8085102,"mean":6.8782317593723,"rank":7000194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8085102,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257816,"mean":11.979465740938,"rank":217987,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257816,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9053,"mean":1.1230691559876,"rank":5118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9053,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":393,"mean":1.1380102040816,"rank":250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":393,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
