Food insecurity status was determined by 3 or more affirmative responses on the 10-item USDA Food Security Scale. Pre-diabetes was self-reported. Logistic regression analyses were used to estimate associations of food insecurity with pre-diabetes and adjusted for several demographic characteristics. All models were stratified by sex and race\/ethnicity.\nIn adjusted models, food insecure non-Hispanic white women and non-Hispanic black women had 53% and over 200% higher odds of being pre-diabetic, respectively. Food insecurity was not related to pre-diabetes for Hispanic women or men.\nLimited food resources appear to place non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black women at risk for pre-diabetes. Linking food assistance programs with community-based health education programs may be a comprehensive approach to support those who are food insecure with diabetes prevention.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021fb","authors":["Murillo, Rosenda","Reesor, Layton M.","Scott, Claudia W.","Hernandez, Daphne C."],"doi":"10.5993\/ajhb.41.4.7","first_seen_on":"2017-07-27T00:44:23+00:00","issns":["1087-3244"],"issue":"4","journal":"American Journal of Health Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1501590986,"links":["http:\/\/www.ingentaconnect.com\/content\/png\/ajhb\/2017\/00000041\/00000004\/art00007"],"pmid":"28601102","publisher":"PNG Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences"],"title":"Food Insecurity and Pre-diabetes in Adults: Race\/Ethnic and Sex Differences","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/murillo-et-al"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.1,"score_history":{"1y":7.1,"6m":7.1,"3m":7.1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8307635,"mean":7.0030489970953,"rank":1202114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":7102679,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8307635,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":183973,"mean":11.888965473007,"rank":36394,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":147454,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":183973,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":302,"mean":5.8841993355482,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":258,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":302,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":2.6857142857143,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":8}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
