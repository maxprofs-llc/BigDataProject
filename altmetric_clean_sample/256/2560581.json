Mean PbM concentration in the current group of breastfeeding mothers tested in 2012\/2013 was 3.73 \u03bcg\/L (SD: 7.3; range: 0.049-28.04), and significantly lower than the 9.83 \u03bcg\/L (SD: 12.75; range: 0.2-49) previously observed in breastfeeding mothers in the study area from 1999 to 2007. Breastfeeding women in the current cohort showed an average PbM\/PbB ratio of 3.6%, which is in agreement with other studies. The mean PbB level obtained for the current cohort was 7.8 \u03bcg\/dl (SD: 5.2; range: 1.4-21), and significantly lower than the mean PbB level of 20.8 \u03bcg\/dl (SD: 16.4; range: 4-73) obtained for the comparison group of breastfeeding mothers tested between 1999 and 2007. A correlation of .687 between paired PbM and maternal PbB was found, indicating that maternal PbB level is a significant predictor of PbM. Current PbM levels remain higher than international averages, but indicate that maternal Pb exposure has declined over time in the environmentally Pb-contaminated study area. The current reduction in Pb in milk and blood of breastfeeding mothers may be due to adherence to a Pb-exposure education and prevention program initiated by the authors in the study area years earlier, as well as recent improvements in local health care delivery.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d73cf058f610001198","authors":["S.
