Although alternative therapies, including phytomedicines and probiotics, have been used to improve eradication, current treatment still relies on a combination of antimicrobial agents, such as amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole, and levofloxacin, and antisecretory agents, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). A standard triple therapy consisting of a PPI and two antibiotics (clarithromycin and amoxicillin\/metronidazole) is widely used as the first-line regimen for treatment of infection, but the increased resistance of H. pylori to clarithromycin and metronidazole has significantly reduced the eradication rate using this therapy and bismuth-containing therapy or 10-d sequential therapy has therefore been proposed to replace standard triple therapy. Alternatively, levofloxacin-based triple therapy can be used as rescue therapy for H. pylori infection after failure of first-line therapy. The increase in resistance to antibiotics, including levofloxacin, may limit the applicability of such regimens. However, since resistance of H. pylori to amoxicillin is generally low, an optimized high dose dual therapy consisting of a PPI and amoxicillin can be an effective first-line or rescue therapy. In addition, the concomitant use of alternative medicine has the potential to provide additive or synergistic effects against H. pylori infection, though its efficacy needs to be verified in clinical studies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d0f","authors":["Yang JC","Lu CW","Lin CJ"],"doi":"10.3748\/wjg.v20.i18.5283","first_seen_on":"2014-08-01T06:20:43+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"18","journal":"World Journal of Gastroenterology","last_mentioned_on":1428660158,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24833858","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24833858?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4017043","pmid":"24833858","pubdate":"2014-05-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Treatment of <i>Helicobacter pylori<\/i> infection: Current status and future concepts.","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/treatment-helicobacter-pylori-infection-current-status-future-concepts-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7881477,"mean":6.674276674566,"rank":6824827,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7881477,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179694,"mean":7.4642162799889,"rank":144491,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179694,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3542,"mean":2.9128788477831,"rank":2446,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3542,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241,"mean":3.9919083333333,"rank":173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AntibioticResis\/status\/586469326850433025","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2560395],"posted_on":"2015-04-10T10:02:38+00:00","author":{"name":"AntibioticResistance","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/551766191962746880\/GlO2QteM_normal.jpeg","description":"Keep abreast of the latest developments in the fight against Antibiotic Resistance #AMR with the latest publications curated from PubMed.
