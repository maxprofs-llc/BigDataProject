In this review, we highlight key studies supporting the concept that farming exposure protects children from asthma and atopy based on studies performed largely in European pediatric cohorts. Various types of farming in certain regions appear to have a greater effect on asthma protection, as does the consumption of unpasteurized milk. In the United State, where concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) are more common, asthma is increased in children exposed especially to swine CAFOs; whereas, rates of atopy and allergy are lower in these children. We also review studies evaluating the role of farming exposures both as a child and\/or as an adult on asthma seen in adults. The importance of microbes in farming environments and the contribution of various components of the innate immune system including toll-like receptors to the underlying mechanisms of asthma related to farming exposures are also reviewed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b0e","authors":["Adam D Wells","Jill A Poole","Debra J Romberger"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.intimp.2014.07.014","first_seen_on":"2014-08-03T10:00:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1878-1705"],"journal":"International Immunopharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1440602955,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25086344?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25086344","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25086344?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25086344","pubdate":"2014-07-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["pharmacology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Influence of farming exposure on the development of asthma and asthma-like symptoms.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-farming-exposure-development-asthma-asthmalike-symptoms"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5552256,"mean":6.3814498674846,"rank":2555970,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2856867,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5552256,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":136657,"mean":8.4630470378177,"rank":57194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":75139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":136657,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":825,"mean":1.6672621359223,"rank":181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":627,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":825,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":0.79528301886792,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
