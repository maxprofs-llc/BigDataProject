Awesome"],"citation":{"abstract":"The sucker ring teeth (SRT) of Humboldt squid exhibit mechanical properties that rival those of robust engineered synthetic polymers. Remarkably, these properties are achieved without a mineral phase or covalent cross-links. Instead, SRT are exclusively made of silk-like proteins called \"suckerins\", which assemble into nanoconfined \u03b2-sheet reinforced supramolecular networks. In this study, three streamlined strategies for full-length recombinant suckerin protein production and purification were developed. Recombinant suckerin exhibited high solubility and colloidal stability in aqueous-based solvents. In addition, the colloidal suspensions exhibited a concentration-dependent conformational switch, from random coil to \u03b2-sheet enriched structures. Our results demonstrate that recombinant suckerin can be produced in a facile manner in E .coli and processed from mild aqueous solutions into materials enriched in \u03b2-sheets. We suggest that recombinant suckerin based materials offer potential for a range of biomedical and engineering applications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023e5","authors":["Dawei Ding"],"doi":"10.1021\/bm500670r","endpage":"3289","first_seen_on":"2014-08-02T16:47:42+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1525-7797","1526-4602"],"issue":"9","journal":"Biomacromolecules","last_mentioned_on":1456951935,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/bm500670r"],"pmid":"25068184","pubdate":"2014-07-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"startpage":"3278","subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Biomimetic Production of Silk-Like Recombinant Squid Sucker Ring Teeth Proteins","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biomimetic-production-silklike-recombinant-squid-sucker-ring-teeth-proteins"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7342039,"mean":6.3783632029643,"rank":549493,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":6788274,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7342039,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176946,"mean":7.4335787504595,"rank":16429,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":160400,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176946,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":885,"mean":4.8395067873303,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":842,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":885,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":5.2048780487805,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
