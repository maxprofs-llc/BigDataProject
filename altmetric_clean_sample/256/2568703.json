The studied lipase was a low cost powdered enzyme preparation, Biolipase-R, from Biocon-Spain, a multipurpose additive used in food industry. In this respect, it is developed a study to optimize the immobilization procedure of these lipases on Sepiolite. Covalent immobilization was achieved by the development of an inorganic-organic hybrid linker formed by a functionalized hydrocarbon chain with a pendant benzaldehyde, bonded to the AlPO4 support surface. Thus, the covalent immobilization of lipases on amorphous AlPO4\/sepiolite (20\/80 wt %) support was evaluated by using two different linkers (p-hydroxybenzaldehyde and benzylamine-terephthalic aldehyde, respectively). Besides, the catalytic behavior of lipases after physical adsorption on the demineralized sepiolite \u00a0was also evaluated. Obtained results indicated that covalent immobilization with the p-hydroxybenzaldehyde linker gave the best biocatalytic behavior. Thus, this covalently immobilized lipase showed a remarkable stability as well as an excellent capacity of reutilization (more than five successive reuses) without a significant loss of its initial catalytic activity. This could allow a more efficient fabrication of biodiesel minimizing the glycerol waste production.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422e","authors":["Carlos Luna"],"doi":"10.3390\/molecules190811419","first_seen_on":"2014-08-04T11:29:54+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"8","journal":"Molecules","last_mentioned_on":1407342438,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/19\/8\/11419"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/19\/8\/11419\/pdf","pmid":"25093983","pubdate":"2014-08-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Biocatalytic Behaviour of Immobilized Rhizopus oryzae Lipase in the 1,3-Selective Ethanolysis of Sunflower Oil to Obtain a Biofuel Similar to Biodiesel","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biocatalytic-behaviour-immobilized-rhizopus-oryzae-lipase-13selective-ethanolysis-sunflower-oil-obta"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":1605960,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2887424,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110319,"mean":8.1612913033234,"rank":32051,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":77733,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110319,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1532,"mean":1.5078758981058,"rank":173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":1355,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1532,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":0.86884210526316,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
