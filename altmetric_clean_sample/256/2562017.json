However, the expression and physiological roles of LGI3 in skin cells remain unknown. In this study, it was found for the first time that LGI3 is expressed mostly by normal human keratinocytes. Furthermore, ELISA analysis showed that HaCaT human keratinocytes increased LGI3 secretion after exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. We next investigated the possible role of LGI3 in keratinocytes. LGI3 (50\u00a0ng\/ml) increased survival of HaCaT cells by 20% after UVB irradiation (150\u00a0mJ\/cm(2) ). It was also found that LGI3 stimulates the phosphorylation of Akt, which is involved in the cell survival-signalling cascade. Furthermore, LGI3 led to the phosphorylation of MDM2 and subsequent p53 degradation. Taken together, the data suggest that LGI3 may regulate p53 levels and that keratinocyte-derived LGI3 may act as a novel cytokine for skin homoeostasis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002891","doi":"10.1111\/j.1600-0625.2012.01550.x","endpage":"718","first_seen_on":"2014-08-01T14:27:23+00:00","issns":["1600-0625"],"issue":"9","journal":"Experimental Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1406898600,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1600-0625.2012.01550.x\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1600-0625.2012.01550.x\/pdf","pmid":"22741557","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"716","subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Ultraviolet B\u2010induced LGI3 secretion protects human keratinocytes","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ultraviolet-binduced-lgi3-secretion-protects-human-keratinocytes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.008,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.008},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4095760,"mean":5.0978025185621,"rank":695258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":3397463,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4095760,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102292,"mean":8.0365583677939,"rank":20447,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":81793,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102292,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":599,"mean":2.5087491638796,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":516,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":599,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":4.05,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Editors\u2019 Picks from Experimental Dermatology","url":"http:\/\/www.scilogs.com\/jid\/editors-picks-from-experimental-dermatology-2\/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=editors-picks-from-experimental-dermatology-2","citation_ids":[2562016,2385728,1528483,2562017,2562018,2562019,2562020],"posted_on":"2014-08-01T13:10:00+00:00","summary":"The dark side of type XVII collagenGostynski et al. identified a so far unrecognized function of type XVII collagen (COL17).
