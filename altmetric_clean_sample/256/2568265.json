It makes use of genotypic information to make predictions used for selection decisions. The accuracy of the predictions depends on the number of genotypes used in the calibration; hence, there is a need of combining data across years. A proper phenotypic analysis is a crucial prerequisite for accurate calibration of genomic prediction procedures. We compared stage-wise approaches to analyse a real dataset of a multi-environment trial (MET) in rye, which was connected between years only through one check, and used different spatial models to obtain better estimates, and thus, improved predictive abilities for genomic prediction. The aims of this study were to assess the advantage of using spatial models for the predictive abilities of genomic prediction, to identify suitable procedures to analyse a MET weakly connected across years using different stage-wise approaches, and to explore genomic prediction as a tool for selection of models for phenotypic data analysis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b9","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2164-15-646","first_seen_on":"2014-08-04T06:37:44+00:00","issns":["1471-2164"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1407144523,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/15\/646\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2164-15-646.pdf","pmid":"25087599","pubdate":"2014-08-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"646","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"The importance of phenotypic data analysis for genomic prediction - a case study comparing different spatial models in rye","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/importance-phenotypic-data-analysis-genomic-prediction-case-study-comparing-different-spatial-models-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7909943,"mean":6.693625728729,"rank":4148223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2205877,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7909943,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180137,"mean":7.6061232624242,"rank":86324,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":73721,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180137,"percentile":40},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5672,"mean":4.0842648562864,"rank":3632,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1501,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5672,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263,"mean":3.3345572519084,"rank":148,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":91,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
