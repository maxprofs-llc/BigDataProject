This paper and its companion paper introduce the Physical therapist-driven Education for Actionable Knowledge translation (PEAK) program, an educational program designed to promote physical therapists' integration of research evidence into clinical decision-making. The pedagogical foundations for the PEAK educational program include Albert Bandura's social cognitive theory and Malcolm Knowles's adult learning theory. Additionally, two complementary frameworks of knowledge translation, the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARiHS) and Knowledge to Action (KTA) Cycle, were used to inform the organizational elements of the program. Finally, the program design was influenced by evidence from previous attempts to facilitate the use of research in practice at the individual and organizational levels.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007bf","authors":["Tilson JK","Mickan S"],"doi":"10.1186\/1472-6920-14-125","first_seen_on":"2014-08-01T04:53:56+00:00","issns":["1472-6920"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Medical Education","last_mentioned_on":1429006433,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24965501","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6920\/14\/125"],"pmid":"24965501","pubdate":"2014-06-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Education","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Education","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Theory of Medicine\/Bioethics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["education"],"title":"Promoting physical therapists\u2019 of research evidence to inform clinical practice: part 1 - theoretical foundation, evidence, and description of the PEAK program","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/promoting-physical-therapists-research-evidence-inform-clinical-practice-part-1-theoretical-foundati-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4995410,"mean":5.9125538661628,"rank":991888,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":3996287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4995410,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124738,"mean":8.3443269118226,"rank":28041,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":96496,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124738,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":913,"mean":4.4867960526316,"rank":257,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":655,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":913,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":5.5366666666667,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
