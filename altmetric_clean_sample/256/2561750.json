Glycoproteins, especially those on the plasma membrane, orchestrate this process; however, hypoxia-perturbed protein glycosylation in cancer cells remains unclear. We focused on the effects of hypoxia on the integrin family of glycoproteins, which are central to the cellular processes of attachment and migration and have been linked with cancer in humans. The ERLIC coupled with iTRAQ labeling and LC-MS\/MS was employed to identify and quantify glycoproteins expressed in A431, which revealed that independent of its protein level change, N-glycosylation modifications of integrin alpha 3 (ITGA3) were inhibited by hypoxia, which was different from other integrin subunits. A combination of Western blot, flow cytometry and cell staining assays showed that hypoxia-induced alterations to ITGA3 glycosylation prevented its efficient translocation to the plasma membrane. Mutagenesis studies demonstrated that simultaneous mutation of glycosites 6 and 7 of ITGA3 prevented its accumulation at K562 cell surface, which blocked integrin alpha 3 and beta 1 heterodimer formation and thus abolished its interaction with extracellular ligands. By generating A431 cells stably expressing ITGA3 mutated at glycosites 6 and 7, we showed that lower levels of ITGA3 on the cell surface, as induced by hypoxia, conferred an increased invasive ability to cancer cells in vitro under hypoxic conditions. Taken together, these results revealed that ITGA3 translocation to the plasma membrane suppressed by hypoxia through inhibition of its glycosylation facilitated cell invasion in A431.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081d9","authors":["Yan Ren","Piliang Hao","S.
