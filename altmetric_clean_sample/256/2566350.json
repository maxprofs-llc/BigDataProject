The effect of capsaicin on Helicobacter pylori has not been investigated previously. Therefore, we performed in vitro time- and concentration-dependent studies to examine the growth of H. pylori in the presence of capsaicin. Capsaicin specifically inhibited growth of H. pylori dose-dependently at concentrations greater than 10 micrograms ml-1 (P < 0.05) but did not inhibit the growth of a human fecal commensal Escherichia coli strain. Bactericidal activity was observed within 4 h. Capsaicin continued to exhibit bactericidal activity when incubated at pH values as low as 5.4. Ingestion of chili, therefore, could have a protective effect against H. pylori-associated gastroduodenal disease. This effect deserves further study in animal models.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028c4","authors":["N L Jones","S Shabib","P M Sherman"],"first_seen_on":"2014-08-03T06:48:41+00:00","issns":["0378-1097"],"issue":"2","journal":"FEMS Microbiology Letters","last_mentioned_on":1445577298,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/9011042\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9011042"],"pmid":"9011042","pubdate":"1997-01-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Capsaicin as an inhibitor of the growth of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori.","type":"article","volume":"146","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/capsaicin-inhibitor-growth-gastric-pathogen-helicobacter-pylori"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6391435,"mean":5.9810902648762,"rank":2352553,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":3944367,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6391435,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150644,"mean":8.0555248501426,"rank":53358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":94346,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150644,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1197,"mean":2.6862023411371,"rank":619,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":562,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1197,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":1.11435,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
