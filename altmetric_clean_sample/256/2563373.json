In this study, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) micropatterns on polystyrene cell-culture plates were prepared using UV photolithography. Cell adhesive polystyrene geometries of triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon, and circle were surrounded by cell nonadhesive PVA to manipulate cell shapes. These different geometries had the same small surface areas for cell spreading. Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were cultured on the micropatterned surface, and the effect of cell geometry on adipogenic differentiation was investigated. MSCs adhered to the geometric micropatterns and formed arrays of single cell with different shapes. The distribution patterns of actin filaments were similar among these cell shapes and remolded during adipogenesis. The adipogenic differentiation potential of MSCs was similar on the small size triangular, square, pentagonal, hexagonal, and circular geometries according to lipid vacuoles staining. This simple micropatterning technique using photoreactive molecules will be useful for creating micropatterns of arbitrary design on an organic surface, and cell functions can be directly and systematically compared on a single surface without external factors resulting from separate cell culture and coating method.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fd3","authors":["Song W","Lu H","Kawazoe N","Chen G"],"doi":"10.1021\/la200487w","endpage":"6162","first_seen_on":"2014-08-01T22:51:18+00:00","issns":["0743-7463","1520-5827"],"issue":"10","journal":"Langmuir","last_mentioned_on":1406933320,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/pdf\/10.1021\/la200487w"],"pmid":"21486006","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"6155","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Adipogenic differentiation of individual mesenchymal stem cell on different geometric micropatterns.","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adipogenic-differentiation-individual-mesenchymal-stem-cell-different-geometric-micropatterns"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4095760,"mean":5.0978025185621,"rank":3278588,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":101007,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4095760,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102292,"mean":8.0366703033503,"rank":81566,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":356,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102292,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1637,"mean":2.7037616136919,"rank":1003,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1637,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113,"mean":3.9478035714286,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Ph.
