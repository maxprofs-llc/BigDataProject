In the present study, cecal samples were collected from 376 migratory birds from species often associated with cattle during the fall migration in the Central Flyway of the United States. Brown-headed cowbirds (n=309, Molothrus ater), common grackles (n=51, Quiscalus quiscula), and cattle egrets (n=12, Bubulcus ibis) contained foodborne pathogenic bacteria in their ceca. Salmonella enterica was isolated from 14.9% of all samples, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 from 3.7%. Salmonella serotypes isolated included the following: Muenster, Montevideo, and Typhimurium. Our data suggest that migratory birds associated with cattle could be a vector for zoonotic enteric pathogenic bacteria to be disseminated across long distances.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6183cf058f61000746b","authors":["CallawayTodd R."],"doi":"10.1089\/fpd.2014.1800","first_seen_on":"2014-08-02T00:43:52+00:00","issns":["1535-3141"],"journal":"Foodborne Pathogens & Disease","last_mentioned_on":1407069526,"links":["http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1089\/fpd.2014.1800"],"pmid":"25078494","pubdate":"2014-07-30T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["parasitology","microbiology","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Isolation of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella from Migratory Brown-Headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater), Common Grackles (Quiscalus quiscula), and Cattle Egrets (Bubulcus ibis).","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/isolation-iescherichia-colii-o157h7-isalmonellai-migratory-brownheaded-cowbirds-imolothrus-ateri-com"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8059538,"mean":6.8397725663364,"rank":3367800,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4640959,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8059538,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180752,"mean":7.6786709672424,"rank":59396,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":119777,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180752,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":482,"mean":2.7909854469854,"rank":126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":351,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":482,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.6857142857143,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/micheletjay\/status\/495369327348944896","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2563577],"posted_on":"2014-08-02T00:43:45+00:00","author":{"name":"Michele Jay-Russell","url":"http:\/\/www.wcfs.ucdavis.edu","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000359308075\/6f324bd96d6d28f803f390401c13f42b_normal.jpeg","description":"Food safety scientist, public health veterinarian, UC Davis alumni; interested in animals, pets, food, ag and health related issues.
