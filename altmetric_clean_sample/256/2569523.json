Blending of an antioxidant with UHMWPE resin powder followed by consolidation and radiation cross-linking has been cleared by the FDA for use in both total hips and total knees for designs incorporating two antioxidants, namely vitamin E and Covernox\u2122 (a medical grade version of Irganox\u2122 1010). The antioxidants in the polymer are expected to protect the polymer during consolidation, during radiation cross-linking, on the shelf before implantation, and in vivo after implantation. To maximize the protection of the polymer afforded by the antioxidant in vivo, a novel approach may be the use of multiple antioxidants, especially to protect the primary antioxidant for a longer period of time. We hypothesized that the addition of a phosphite stabilizer (Irgafos 168\u2122) commonly used in conjunction with hindered phenolic antioxidants in polymer processing could improve the oxidative stability of radiation cross-linked blends of vitamin E. To test our hypothesis, we prepared UHMWPE blends with 0.05\u2009wt% Irgafos and 0.05\u2009wt% vitamin E and compared its cross-link density, wear resistance, tensile properties, and impact strength to control blends containing only vitamin E. Our hypothesis was not supported; the cross-link density of UHMWPE was significantly decreased by the additive without additional benefit to oxidative stability. To our knowledge, this was the first attempt at using multiple stabilizers in medical grade UHMWPE.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002ea1","authors":["Oral E","Neils A","Yabannavar P","Muratoglu OK"],"doi":"10.1002\/jor.22597","first_seen_on":"2014-08-04T17:06:05+00:00","issns":["0736-0266"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Orthopaedic Research","last_mentioned_on":1407175778,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24536024"],"pmid":"24536024","pubdate":"2014-02-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"The Effect of an Additional Phosphite Stabilizer on the Properties of Radiation Cross-Linked Vitamin E Blends of UHMWPE.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-additional-phosphite-stabilizer-properties-radiation-crosslinked-vitamin-e-blends-uhmwpe"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.95,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":2163449,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2869044,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126727,"mean":8.4528707289746,"rank":47955,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":78657,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126727,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":805,"mean":1.8957263681592,"rank":178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":627,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":805,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.9866666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
