Merr cv. Zhongdou 40) seed germination and seedling growth were studied. Seeds were pre-treated with 0, 60, 80, 100 and 120\u2005W of cold plasma for 15\u2005s. Results showed that plasma treatments had positive effects on seed germination and seedling growth, and treatment of 80\u2005W had the highest stimulatory effect. Germination and vigor indices significantly increased by 14.66% and 63.33%, respectively. Seed's water uptake improved by 14.03%, and apparent contact angle decreased by 26.19%. Characteristics of seedling growth, including shoot length, shoot dry weight, root length and root dry weight, significantly increased by 13.77%, 21.95%, 21.42% and 27.51%, respectively, compared with control. The seed reserve utilization, including weight of the mobilized seed reserve, seed reserve depletion percentage and seed reserve utilization efficiency significantly improved by cold plasma treatment. In addition, soluble sugar and protein contents were 16.51% and 25.08% higher than those of the control. Compared to a 21.95% increase in shoot weight, the root weight increased by 27.51% after treatment, indicating that plasma treatment had a greater stimulatory effect on plant roots. These results indicated that cold plasma treatment might promote the growth even yield of soybean.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Li Ling","Jiang Jiafeng","Li Jiangang","Shen Minchong","He Xin","Shao Hanliang","Dong Yuanhua"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep05859","first_seen_on":"2014-08-02T10:29:57+00:00","issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1451485916,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25080862?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep05859"],"pmid":"25080862","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plasma physics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Plant sciences","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Effects of cold plasma treatment on seed germination and seedling growth of soybean","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-cold-plasma-treatment-seed-germination-seedling-growth-soybean"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8157517,"mean":6.8929958806019,"rank":4095442,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3854706,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8157517,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":181102,"mean":7.7024583519696,"rank":79661,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":94912,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":181102,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33899,"mean":14.897365154286,"rank":18133,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":14224,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33899,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":640,"mean":15.169605633803,"rank":363,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":251,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":640,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/RootPapers\/status\/495516646648205313","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2564474],"posted_on":"2014-08-02T10:29:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Root Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/447736797422813184\/Q7OqMgVA_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Plant Root papers in #PubMed, #arXiv, #Bioarxiv and #PeerJ Preprints.
