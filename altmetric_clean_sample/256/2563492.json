Therefore, cellulose biosynthesis inhibitors (CBIs) have a potentially broad acting herbicidal mode of action and are also useful tools in decoding fundamental aspects of cellulose biosynthesis. Here, we characterize the herbicide indaziflam as a CBI and provide insight into its inhibitory mechanism. Indaziflam treated seedlings exhibited the CBI-like symptomologies of radial swelling and ectopic lignification. Furthermore, indaziflam inhibited the production of cellulose within < 1 hour of treatment and in a dose dependent manner. Unlike the CBI isoxaben, indaziflam had strong CBI activity in both a monocotylonous (Poa annua L.) and a dicotyledonous plant (Arabidopsis thaliana L.). Arabidopsis mutants resistant to known CBIs, isoxaben or quinoxyphen, were not cross-resistant to indaziflam suggesting a different molecular target for indaziflam. To explore this further, we monitored the distribution and mobility of fluorescently labeled CELLULOSE SYNTHASE A (CESA) proteins in living cells of Arabidopsis during indaziflam exposure. Indaziflam caused a reduction in the velocity of YFP:CESA6 particles at the plasma membrane (PM) focal plane when compared to controls. Microtubule (MT) morphology and motility were not altered after indaziflam treatment. In the hypocotyl expansion zone, indaziflam caused an atypical increase in the density of PM localized CESA particles. Interestingly, this was accompanied by a cellulose synthase interacting 1 (CSI1) independent reduction in the normal coincidence rate between MT and CESA. As a CBI, for which there is little evidence of evolved weed resistance, indaziflam represents an important addition to the action mechanisms available for weed management.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000333b","authors":["Chad Brabham","Lei Lei","Jozsef Stork","Michael Barrett","Ying Gu","Seth DeBolt"],"doi":"10.1104\/pp.114.241950","first_seen_on":"2014-08-02T00:01:54+00:00","issns":["1532-2548"],"journal":"Plant Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1438864249,"links":["http:\/\/www.plantphysiol.org\/content\/early\/2014\/07\/30\/pp.114.241950.abstract","http:\/\/www.plantphysiol.org\/content\/166\/3\/1177"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.plantphysiol.org\/content\/early\/2014\/07\/30\/pp.114.241950.full.pdf","pmid":"25077797","pubdate":"2014-07-29T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Indaziflam Herbicidal Action: A Potent Cellulose Biosynthesis Inhibitor","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/indaziflam-herbicidal-action-potent-cellulose-biosynthesis-inhibitor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5450695,"mean":6.347149723687,"rank":2056842,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":3372547,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5450695,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133420,"mean":8.5043520637992,"rank":42084,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":90735,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133420,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3049,"mean":3.4555360892388,"rank":1186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":1858,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3049,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96,"mean":3.6997684210526,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":78,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
