The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) is a widely used self-report measure used to determine a person's level of pain catastrophizing, assumed to be associated with an ongoing, recalled or anticipated pain experience. In practice, instructions for self-reporting catastrophizing typically do not provide a specific pain referent, even when assessing patients with chronic pain. Researchers have noted that it is not known what type of pain participants are referring to when responding to a catastrophizing questionnaire.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f6100058cc","authors":["Kapoor S","Thorn BE","Bandy O","Clements KL","Kapoor, S.","Thorn, B.E.","Bandy, O.","Clements, K.L."],"doi":"10.1002\/ejp.561","endpage":"407","first_seen_on":"2014-08-01T23:16:01+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1532-2149","1090-3801"],"issue":"3","journal":"European Journal of Pain","last_mentioned_on":1425743958,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25059471?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ejp.561\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ejp.561\/pdf","pmid":"25059471","pubdate":"2014-07-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"400","subjects":["psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"Pain referents used to respond to the Pain Catastrophizing Scale","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pain-referents-used-respond-pain-catastrophizing-scale"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6396843,"mean":5.9825057486175,"rank":2620753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3632230,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6396843,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150823,"mean":7.9675004574932,"rank":61802,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":84114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150823,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":657,"mean":5.449131097561,"rank":337,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":297,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":657,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":4.4047777777778,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
