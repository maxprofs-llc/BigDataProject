Partition-model predictive dosimetry relies on differential tumoral\/non-tumoral perfusion evaluated on pre-treatment (99m)Tc macroaggregate albumin (MAA) single photon emission tomography (SPECT) \/ computed tomography (CT). The aim of this study was to evaluate the agreement between predictive dosimetry of (99m)Tc-MAA SPECT\/CT and post-treatment dosimetry based on (90)Y time-of-flight (TOF) positron emission tomography (PET)\/CT.\n(99m)Tc-MAA SPECT\/CT of 27 treatment sessions (25 HCC patients, 41 lesions) with (90)Y SIRT (7 glass-spheres, 20 resin-spheres) post-treatment (90)Y-TOF PET\/CT were compared. 3D, voxelized dose-maps were computed from (99m)Tc-MAA SPECT\/CT and (90)Y-TOF PET\/CT. Mean absorbed dose (D_mean) was evaluated to compute the predicted\/actual dose ratio: \u3016DR\u3017_mean = (D_mean^MAA)\u2044(D_mean^(90)Y ) in tumor (TVs) and non-tumor (NTVs) volumes for glass and resin spheres. Lin's concordance (\u03c1_c) was used to measure accuracy (C_b) and precision (\u03c1).\nAdministered activity ranged from 0.8-1.9GBq for glass microspheres and 0.6-3.4GBq for resin, TVs ranged from 2-125 ml and 6-1828 ml respectively. The mean dose (glass\/resin) D_mean^(90)Y was 240\/122 Gy in TVs, and 72\/47 Gy in NTVs. \u3016DR\u3017_mean^TV was 1.46\u00b10.58 (0.65-2.53) for glass, 1.16\u00b10.41 (0.54-2.54) for resin spheres.\u3016 DR\u3017_mean^NTV was 0.88\u00b10.15 (0.56-1.00), and 0.86\u00b10.2 (0.58\u00ac-1.35). DR variability in NTVs was substantially lower than in TVs. Lin's Concordance between D_mean^MAA and D_mean^(90)Y (resin-spheres) was significantly better for lesions >150 ml than lesions \u2264150 ml (\u03c1_c= 0.93; C_b= 0.95 vs., \u03c1_c= 0.57; C_b= 0.93, p<0.05).\nIn (90)Y radioembolisation of HCC, predictive dosimetry based on (99m)Tc-MAA SPECT\/CT provided good estimates of absorbed doses calculated from post-treatment (90)Y-TOF PET\/CT, for tumor and non-tumor tissues. The low variability of \u3016DR\u3017^NTV demonstrates that pre-treatment dosimetry is particularly suitable to minimize radiation-induced hepatotoxicity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007da6","authors":["Gnesin, Silvano","Canetti, Laurent","Adib, Salim","Cherbuin, Nicolas","Silva-Monteiro, Marina","Bize, Pierre","Denys, Alban","Prior, John O","Baechler, Sebastien","Boubaker, Ariane","S.
