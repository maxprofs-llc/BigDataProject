Through its ability to scavenge toxic oxygen derivatives and regulate cellular mRNA levels for antioxidant enzymes, this molecule has been shown to play a protective role against damage by free radicals, to which in vitro cultured embryos are exposed during early development. In vivo and in vitro studies have been performed showing that the use of nanocapsules as active substances carriers increases stability, bioavailability and biodistribution of drugs, such as melatonin, to the cells and tissues, improving their antioxidant properties. These properties can be modulated through the manipulation of formula composition, especially in relation to the supramolecular structures of the nanocapsule core and the surface area that greatly influences drug release mechanisms in biological environments. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of two types of melatonin-loaded nanocapsules with distinct supramolecular structures, polymeric (NC) and lipid-core (LNC) nanocapsules, on in vitro cultured bovine embryos. Embryonic development, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and mRNA levels of genes involved in cell apoptosis, ROS and cell pluripotency were evaluated after supplementation of culture medium with non-encapsulated melatonin (Mel), melatonin-loaded polymeric nanocapsules (Mel-NC) and melatonin-loaded lipid-core nanocapsules (Mel-LNC) at 10-6, 10-9, and 10-12 M drug concentrations. The highest hatching rate was observed in embryos treated with 10-9 M Mel-LNC. When compared to Mel and Mel-NC treatments at the same concentration (10-9 M), Mel-LNC increased embryo cell number, decreased cell apoptosis and ROS levels, down-regulated mRNA levels of BAX, CASP3, and SHC1 genes, and up-regulated mRNA levels of CAT and SOD2 genes. These findings indicate that nanoencapsulation with LNC increases the protective effects of melatonin against oxidative stress and cell apoptosis during in vitro embryo culture in bovine species.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Komninou, Eliza Rossi","Remi\u00e3o, Mariana H\u00e4rter","Lucas, Caroline Gomes","Domingues, William Borges","Basso, Andrea Cristina","Jornada, Denise Soledade","Deschamps, Jo\u00e3o Carlos","Beck, Ruy Carlos Ruver","Pohlmann, Adriana Raffin","Bordignon, Vilceu","Seixas, Fabiana K\u00f6mmling","Campos, Vinicius Farias","Guterres, Silvia Stanis\u00e7uaski","Collares, Tiago"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0157561","first_seen_on":"2016-06-17T16:08:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"6","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1466157908,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27310006?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4910990","pmid":"27310006","pubdate":"2016-06-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0157561","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Effects of Two Types of Melatonin-Loaded Nanocapsules with Distinct Supramolecular Structures: Polymeric (NC) and Lipid-Core Nanocapsules (LNC) on Bovine Embryo Culture Model","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-two-types-melatoninloaded-nanocapsules-distinct-supramolecular-structures-polymeric-nc-lipid"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7909849,"mean":6.6937446400934,"rank":4148243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2205716,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7909849,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262878,"mean":11.572944662332,"rank":142583,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":94093,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262878,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111193,"mean":10.333020882798,"rank":64262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":35750,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111193,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4604,"mean":11.551758852922,"rank":2873,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":1298,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4604,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
