Cross-section images of the pancreatic LEC typically show a well demarcated unilocular or multilocular cyst without a solid component. Here we report a rare case of pancreatic LEC in which multiple floating ball-like components were depicted via endoscopic ultrasound. The ball-like components were also depicted by various imaging methods such as computed tomography (CT) showing low-density components, T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) showing high-intensity components, and T2-weighted MRI showing low-intensity components. The ball-like components in all images were not well enhanced. Laparotomic cyst resection was performed, and the surgical material revealed keratin balls inside the pancreatic LEC. Keratin components of a pancreatic LEC can take a liquid, sludge, or solid form. Clinicians must be aware of the variations in imaging to facilitate the differentiation and management of pancreatic cystic lesions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fec","authors":["Matsubayashi, Hiroyuki","Aikawa, Yoshiko","Sugiura, Teiichi","Sasaki, Keiko","Hotta, Kinichi","Ono, Hiroyuki"],"first_seen_on":"2016-06-17T17:38:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1842-1121"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Gastrointestinal & Liver Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1466162786,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27308657?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27308657","pubdate":"2016-06-17T22:00:54+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Pancreatic Lymphoepithelial Cyst Showing Multiple Floating Ball-like Appearances.","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pancreatic-lymphoepithelial-cyst-showing-multiple-floating-balllike-appearances"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7909849,"mean":6.6937446400934,"rank":6848488,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7909849,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262878,"mean":11.572910235585,"rank":219924,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262878,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":153,"mean":1.9279342105263,"rank":98,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":153,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.58,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/statuses\/743766749749743616","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8828890],"posted_on":"2016-06-17T11:26:26+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":371},"tweet_id":"743766749749743616"}]}}
