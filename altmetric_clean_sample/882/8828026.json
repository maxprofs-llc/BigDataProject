(Veige)"],"citation":{"abstract":"This report describes the synthesis and characterization of novel N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-gold(I) complexes and their bioconjugation to the CCRF-CEM-leukemia-specific aptamer sgc8c. Successful bioconjugation was confirmed by the use of fluorescent tags on both the NHC-Au(I) complex and the aptamer. Cell-viability assays indicated that the NHC-Au(I) -aptamer conjugate was more cytotoxic than the NHC-gold complex alone. A combination of flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, and cell-viability assays provided clear evidence that the NHC-Au(I) -aptamer conjugate was selective for targeted CCRF-CEM leukemia cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Niu, Weijia","Chen, Xigao","Tan, Weihong","Veige, Adam S.","Veige, Adam S"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201602702","endpage":"8893","first_seen_on":"2016-06-17T16:56:07+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3773"],"issue":"31","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
