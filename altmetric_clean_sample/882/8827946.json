Here we reported three Chinese genetic Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease cases (gCJD) with a rare mutation in PRNP leading to an exchange of amino acid from glutamic acid (E) to alanine (A) at codon 196 (E196A). All three patients were Han Chinese without any sibship among them. They showed various unspecific symptoms at onset and displayed typical clinical manifestations of sporadic CJD with progress of disease. The same time, two cases showed psychotic symptoms during the clinical courses. 14-3-3 proteins were positive in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and special abnormality were detected in MRI of all the cases. The polymorphism of codon 129 was methionin homozygote and that of codon 219 was glutamate homozygote in all three patients. The disease durations of the three cases varied from 10 to 22\u00a0months And no disease associated family history was figured out in all the cases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f6100085cb","authors":["Shi, Qi","Zhou, Wei","Chen, Cao","Zhang, Bao-Yun","Xiao, Kang","Wang, Yuan","Dong, Xiao-Ping"],"doi":"10.1080\/19336896.2016.1190897","endpage":"00","first_seen_on":"2016-06-17T16:53:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1933-690X","1933-6896"],"journal":"Prion","last_mentioned_on":1466160077,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27310471?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27310471","pubdate":"2016-06-16T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"00","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"\n              Rare E196A mutation in\n              PRNP\n              gene of three Chinese patients with Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease\n            ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rare-e196a-mutation-prnp-gene-3-chinese-patients-creutzfeldtjacob-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7909849,"mean":6.6937446400934,"rank":5998430,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1061393,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7909849,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262878,"mean":11.572925261624,"rank":184120,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":42956,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262878,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262,"mean":2.9031264367816,"rank":143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":3.1454545454545,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/myneuronetcom\/statuses\/743755388953059330","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8827946],"posted_on":"2016-06-17T10:41:17+00:00","author":{"name":"myneuronet","url":"http:\/\/myneuronet.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/577931443222921216\/maPnNPXl_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"myneuronetcom","tweeter_id":"3093330869","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":18},"tweet_id":"743755388953059330"}]}}
