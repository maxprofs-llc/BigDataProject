Their DNA content is often further increased by endoreplication, which occurs as a part of cell differentiation. Here, we explore the relationship between 3D chromatin architecture, number of genome copies and their origin in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. Spatial proximity between pericentromeric, interstitial and subtelomeric domains of chromosomes 1 and 4 was quantified over a range of distances. The results indicate that average nuclear volume as well as chromatin density increase with the genome copy number. Similar dependence is observed when association of homologous chromosomes (in 2C\/ endopolyploid nuclei) and sister chromatid separation (in endopolyploid nuclei) is studied. Moreover, clusters of chromosomal domains are detectable at the spatial scale above microscopy resolution. Subtelomeric, interstitial and pericentromeric chromosomal domains are affected to different extent by these processes, which are modulated by endopolyploidy. This factor influences fusion of heterochromatin as well. Nonetheless, local chromatin architecture of Arabidopsis thaliana depends mainly on endopolyploidy level, and to lesser extend on polyploidy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5303cf058f6100042ba","authors":["Sas-Nowosielska, H","Bernas, T"],"doi":"10.1080\/19491034.2016.1182277","endpage":"231","first_seen_on":"2016-06-17T16:50:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1949-1042","1949-1034"],"issue":"2","journal":"Nucleus","last_mentioned_on":1466159889,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27310308?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4916897","pmid":"27310308","pubdate":"2016-06-16T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"216","subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"\n              Spatial relationship between chromosomal domains in diploid and autotetraploid\n              Arabidopsis thaliana\n              nuclei\n            ","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/spatial-relationship-between-chromosomal-domains-diploid-autotetraploid-arabidopsis-thaliana-nuclei"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7909849,"mean":6.6937446400934,"rank":6848489,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7909849,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262878,"mean":11.572930016699,"rank":219923,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262878,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":226,"mean":1.4364622222222,"rank":164,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":226,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":3.178625,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/epigen_papers\/statuses\/743754599627001856","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8827872],"posted_on":"2016-06-17T10:38:09+00:00","author":{"name":"epigenetics_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Epigenetics","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/471205704921931776\/wSQqKYz8_normal.jpeg","description":"Chromatin & epigenetics paper feed from #Pubmed and #Arxiv - hear it here first!
