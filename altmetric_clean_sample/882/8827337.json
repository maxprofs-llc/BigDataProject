To different degrees, all of the fungi adhered to polystyrene after 4 h, with a predominance of those with germinated conidia. Prolonged fungi-polystyrene contact resulted in the formation of a monolayer of intertwined mycelia, which was identified as a typical biofilm structure due to the presence of a viable mycelial biomass, extracellular matrix and enhanced antifungal resistance. Ultrastructural details were revealed by SEM and CLSM, showing the dense compaction of the mycelial biomass and the presence of channels within the organized biofilm. A similar biofilm structure was observed following the co-culture of each fungus with A549 cells, revealing a mycelial trap covering all of the lung epithelial monolayer. Collectively, these results highlight the potential for biofilm formation by these clinically relevant fungal pathogens.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d73cf058f610001226","authors":["Mello, Tha\u00eds P","Aor, Ana Carolina","Gon\u00e7alves, Diego S","Seabra, Sergio H","Branquinha, Marta H","Santos, Andr\u00e9 L S"],"doi":"10.1080\/08927014.2016.1192610","endpage":"749","first_seen_on":"2016-06-17T16:31:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1029-2454","0892-7014"],"issue":"7","journal":"Biofouling","last_mentioned_on":1473602560,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27309801?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27309801","pubdate":"2016-06-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"737","subjects":["biology"],"title":"\n              Assessment of biofilm formation by\n              Scedosporium apiospermum\n              ,\n              S. aurantiacum\n              ,\n              S. minutisporum\n              and\n              Lomentospora prolificans\n            ","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/assessment-biofilm-formation-scedosporium-apiospermum-s-aurantiacum-s-minutisporum-lomentospora-prol"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8360145,"mean":7.0505745135414,"rank":6045348,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2015919,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8360145,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266740,"mean":11.741465904873,"rank":169431,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":81719,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266740,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":327,"mean":2.3476687116564,"rank":163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":147,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":327,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":1.6732941176471,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"TH":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/biofilmPapers\/statuses\/743750069506039808","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8827337],"posted_on":"2016-06-17T10:20:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Biofilm Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/585213267288653824\/evf5BSKg_normal.jpg","description":"Stay on top of all the latest publications on Biofilm research curated from PubMed. #biofilm #microbiology #antibioticresistance.
