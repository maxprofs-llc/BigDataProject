Dectin-1 recognizes \u03b2-glucans and mediates innate immune responses to Aspergillus fumigatus. Transcription factor PU.1 has been the focus of recent research due to its role in inflammation and infection. However, its role in Dectin-1 regulation during A. fumigatus infection remains to be elucidated.\nTHP-1 cells were stimulated with A. fumigatus conidia. We then used real-time RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence assays to analyze the mRNA and protein levels and cellular distribution, respectively, of Dectin-1 and PU.1 in stimulated THP-1 cells. Additionally, we used the luciferase reporter assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), and RNA interference experiments to investigate the role of PU.1 in Dectin-1 regulation.\nOur results revealed that Dectin-1 mRNA and protein levels as well as the PU.1 protein level were increased in THP-1 cells stimulated with A. fumigatus conidia, while the mRNA expression level did not significantly change between the stimulated and control groups. We also observed that PU.1 translocated into the nucleus in stimulated THP-1 cells. The results of the luciferase reporter assay showed that PU.1 promoted human Dectin-1 (hDectin-1) gene activity. ChIP and EMSA indicated that PU.1 could bind with hDectin-1 gene promoter at three potential transcription factor-binding sites (TFBSs). In addition, knockdown of PU.1 significantly decreased Dectin-1 expression.\nThis study demonstrated the novel role of PU.1 in the immune response to A. fumigatus through upregulation of Dectin-1 expression and its translocation to the nucleus in A. fumigatus-stimulated THP-1 cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007bd","authors":["Wang, Min","Liu, Zhicheng","Liu, Chenyang","Wu, Ting","Cai, Feng","Wang, Quan","Su, Xin","Shi, Yi","Min Wang","Zhicheng Liu","Chenyang Liu","Ting Wu","Feng Cai","Quan Wang","Xin Su","Yi Shi"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12879-016-1632-x","first_seen_on":"2016-06-17T17:27:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-2334"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1466273269,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27306059?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12879-016-1632-x"],"pmcid":"PMC4910222","pmid":"27306059","pubdate":"2016-06-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Parasitology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Tropical Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"PU.1 is involved in the immune response to Aspergillus fumigatus through upregulating Dectin-1 expression","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pu1-involved-immune-response-aspergillus-fumigatus-through-upregulating-dectin1-expression"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7912542,"mean":6.6949158185663,"rank":5717753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1912325,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7912542,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262889,"mean":11.57378697392,"rank":168948,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":78792,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262889,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3557,"mean":3.8062137232846,"rank":2327,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":951,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3557,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164,"mean":2.501717791411,"rank":76,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":67,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Computer Science":1,"Chemical Engineering":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1,"VE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Immunol_papers\/statuses\/743762902633447424","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8828674],"posted_on":"2016-06-17T11:11:09+00:00","author":{"name":"ImmunologyPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507527250015576065\/AHPc4B-C_normal.png","description":"A TwitterBot for #Immunology papers on #PubMed searching for adaptive, innate and cyto\/chemokine.
