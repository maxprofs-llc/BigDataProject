One important technical reason for this difficulty is the restricted frequency range (0.3-3.4 kHz) of conventional landline telephones. Internet telephony (voice over Internet protocol [VoIP]) is transmitted with a larger frequency range (0.1-8 kHz) and therefore includes more frequencies relevant to speech perception. According to a recently published, laboratory-based study, the theoretical advantage of ideal VoIP conditions over conventional telephone quality has translated into improved speech perception by hearing-impaired individuals. However, the speech perception benefits of nonideal VoIP network conditions, which may occur in daily life, have not been explored. VoIP use cannot be recommended to hearing-impaired individuals before its potential under more realistic conditions has been examined.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5733cf058f610004cb1","authors":["Georgios Mantokoudis"],"doi":"10.2196\/jmir.1818","first_seen_on":"2012-07-16T17:54:22+00:00","issns":["1439-4456"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Medical Internet Research","last_mentioned_on":1343333266,"links":["http:\/\/www.jmir.org\/2012\/4\/e102\/"],"pmid":"22805169","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"JMIR Publications Inc., Toronto, Canada","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicalinformatics"],"title":"Speech Perception Benefits of Internet Versus Conventional Telephony for Hearing-Impaired Individuals","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/speech-perception-benefits-internet-versus-conventional-telephony-hearingimpaired-individuals"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4704086,"mean":5.7142677783265,"rank":1014647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":3681038,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4704086,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76289,"mean":5.4527283190017,"rank":15760,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":60334,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76289,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1359,"mean":22.128346097202,"rank":1037,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":313,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1359,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
