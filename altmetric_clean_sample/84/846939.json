Here, we report an improved sequencing method achieving significantly increased throughput and decreased cost by replacing laborious sequencing library preparation steps with PCR employing a single primer pair designed to amplify a discrete subset of repeated regions. Using this approach, samples containing as little as 4% trisomy 21 DNA could be readily distinguished from euploid samples.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Isaac Kinde","Nickolas Papadopoulos","Kenneth W.
