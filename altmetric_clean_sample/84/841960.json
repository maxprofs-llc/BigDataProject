A large variety of cellular stimuli utilize these signaling pathways through a common upstream kinase transforming growth factor-\u03b2-activated kinase 1 (TAK1). TAK1 was originally identified as a mitogen-activated kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) activated by transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2); however, it has been characterized as a key regulator in inflammatory and immune signaling pathways. In addition, microbial proteins and components of host cell signaling scramble for the TAK1 complex in innate immunity. This review highlights the recent advances in the activation mechanisms and physiological functions of TAK1. Research targeting TAK1 raises the potential for new therapeutic options for inflammatory disorders, including cancer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036b4","authors":["Hiroaki Sakurai"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.tips.2012.06.007","first_seen_on":"2012-07-16T14:07:01+00:00","issns":["0165-6147"],"journal":"Trends in Pharmacological Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1348615582,"links":["http:\/\/www.cell.com\/trends\/pharmacological-sciences\/abstract\/S0165-6147%2812%2900113-7"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/download.cell.com\/trends\/pharmacological-sciences\/pdf\/PIIS0165614712001137.pdf","pmid":"22795313","pubdate":"2012-07-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Targeting of TAK1 in inflammatory disorders and cancer","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/targeting-tak1-inflammatory-disorders-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.95,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":877930,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":3623527,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75491,"mean":5.1811148496489,"rank":14564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":60823,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75491,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":630,"mean":3.5646009538951,"rank":124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":506,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":630,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.45,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":17,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
