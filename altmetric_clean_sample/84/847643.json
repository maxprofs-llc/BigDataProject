Dahlstrom, J. R. Graham, A. Tellegen, & B. Kaemmer, 1989), including the Restructured Clinical (RC) scales, in the prediction of clinical diagnostic status for African American and Caucasian male veterans seeking substance abuse treatment. Patients completed a battery of self-report instruments and were administered structured diagnostic interviews. African American patients obtained higher scores across most MMPI-2 scales compared with Caucasians with clinically meaningful elevations (T scores > 5 points) on 3 scales. The RC scales demonstrated strong correlations with diagnoses, however, like other MMPI-2 scales examined in this study, they displayed a general trend of predictive bias. Step-down hierarchical regression procedures (G. J. Lautenschlager & J. L. Mendoza, 1986) indicated the presence of predictive bias for a majority of the scales examined; however, most of these effects were small to modest (accounting for 3%-5% of variance). The pattern of slope and intercept biases across types of MMPI-2 scales differs from prior research and indicates the importance of evaluating bias in various populations and settings.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033d7","authors":["Monnot MJ","Quirk SW","Hoerger M","Brewer L"],"doi":"10.1037\/a0015316","endpage":"151","first_seen_on":"2012-07-19T15:49:07+00:00","issns":["1040-3590","1939-134X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Psychological Assessment","last_mentioned_on":1474966807,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19485669","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1037\/a0015316"],"pmid":"19485669","pubdate":"2009-06-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Business And Management","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"137","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Racial bias in personality assessment: using the MMPI-2 to predict psychiatric diagnoses of African American and Caucasian chemical dependency inpatients.","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/racial-bias-personality-assessment-using-mmpi2-predict-psychiatric-diagnoses-african-american-caucas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8440126,"mean":7.0979478654558,"rank":3671164,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4647693,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8440126,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95451,"mean":5.9857570874804,"rank":35587,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":58139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95451,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1222,"mean":2.4091646191646,"rank":320,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":879,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1222,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.025,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
