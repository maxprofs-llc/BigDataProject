There are only limited data describing specifically, the mechanical changes occurring in the foot in SSc. A pilot project conducted in preparation for this trial confirmed the previous reports of foot related impairment and reduced foot function in people with SSc and demonstrated a link to mechanical etiologies. To-date there have been no formal studies of interventions directed at the foot problems experienced by people with Systemic Sclerosis. The primary aim of this trial is to evaluate whether foot pain and foot-related health status in people with Systemic Sclerosis can be improved through the provision of a simple pressure-relieving insole.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007ca","authors":["Alcacer-Pitarch B","Buch MH","Gray J","Denton CP","Herrick A","Navarro-Coy N","Collier H","Loughrey L","Pavitt S","Siddle HJ","Wright J","Helliwell PS","Emery P","Redmond AC","Begonya Alcacer-Pitarch","Maya H Buch","Janine Gray","Christopher P Denton","Ariane Herrick","Nuria Navarro-Coy","Howard Collier","Lorraine Loughrey","Sue Pavitt","Heidi J Siddle","Jonathan Wright","Philip S Helliwell","Paul Emery","Anthony C Redmond"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2474-13-11","first_seen_on":"2012-07-15T14:13:45+00:00","funders":["aruk","dohuk"],"issns":["","1471-2474"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1342361082,"links":["http:\/\/ukpmc.ac.uk\/articles\/..\/articles\/PMC3395828\/reload=0;jsessionid=BK6ZLb3ydY1NqB3vXFvX.0"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ukpmc.ac.uk\/articles\/PMC3395828?pdf=render","pmid":"22309847","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics","physiology"],"title":"Pressure and pain In Systemic sclerosis\/Scleroderma - an evaluation of a simple intervention (PISCES): randomised controlled trial protocol","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2474-13-11","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pressure-pain-systemic-sclerosisscleroderma-evaluation-simple-intervention-pisces-randomised-control"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4681163,"mean":5.6987966927893,"rank":3320111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":759875,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4681163,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75917,"mean":5.4237470625428,"rank":49758,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":12858,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75917,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1597,"mean":4.3289047619048,"rank":1368,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":125,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1597,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":6.1717192982456,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/UKPubMedCentral\/status\/224504767722958848","citation_ids":[840887],"posted_on":"2012-07-15T14:04:42+00:00","author":{"name":"Europe PMC articles","url":"http:\/\/europepmc.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2792175138\/f93f2e30d1cca847800e6f3060b8101a_normal.jpeg","description":"RSS-feed of new free articles added to Europe PMC, affiliated to Europe PMC funders.
