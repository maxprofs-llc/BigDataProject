At rest, athletes had significantly higher superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity, higher levels of glutathione (GSH) and nitric oxide (NO) and lower levels of lipid peroxidation (TBARS) compared with non-athletes. A maximal exercise test induced statistically significant rise of superoxide anion radical (O2-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and NO levels in non-athletes, while TBARS levels decreased. Athletes experienced the fall in NO levels and the fall in CAT activity. After exercise, athletes had significantly lower levels of O2- compared with non-athletes. Two way repeated measures ANOVA showed that the response of O2-, NO and TBARS to the exercise test was dependent on the sports engagement (training experience) of subjects. Significant correlations between morphofunctional and redox parameters were found. These results suggest that physical fitness affects redox homeostasis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9373cf058f61000decb","authors":["Djordjevic DZ","Cubrilo DG","Barudzic NS","Vuletic MS","Zivkovic VI","Nesic M","Radovanovic D","Djuric DM","Jakovljevic VLj"],"doi":"10.4149\/gpb_2012_025","first_seen_on":"2012-07-19T14:39:20+00:00","issns":["0231-5882"],"issue":"2","journal":"General physiology and biophysics","last_mentioned_on":1342708662,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22781825"],"pmid":"22781825","pubdate":"2012-07-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","physiology"],"title":"Comparison of blood pro\/antioxidant levels before and after acute exercise in athletes and non-athletes.","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-blood-proantioxidant-levels-before-afer-acute-exercise-athletes-nonathletes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3063437,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":942846,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74987,"mean":5.2729654602192,"rank":48186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":14541,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74987,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":1.4634666666667,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.375,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
