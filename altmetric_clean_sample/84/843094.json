TLR7, as well as TLR3 and TLR8, triggers the immune responses, such as the production of type I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines via recognition of viral nucleic acids in the infected cells. In this study, we proposed that imiquimod has an IFN-independent antiviral effect in nonimmune cells. Imiquimod, but not resiquimod, suppressed replication of human herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) in FL cells. We analyzed alternation of gene expression by treatment with imiquimod using microarray analysis. Neither type I IFNs, nor TLRs, nor IFN-inducible antiviral genes were induced in imiquimod-treated FL cells. Cystatin A, a host cysteine protease inhibitor, was strongly upregulated by imiquimod and took a major part in the anti-HSV-1 activity deduced by the suppression experiment using its small interfering RNA. Upregulation of cystatin A was suggested to be mediated by antagonizing adenosine receptor A(1) and activating the protein kinase A pathway. Imiquimod, but not resiquimod, was shown to interact with adenosine receptor A(1). Imiquimod-induced anti-HSV-1 activity was observed in other cells, such as HeLa, SiHa, and CaSki cells, in a manner consistent with the cystatin A induction by imiquimod. These results indicated that imiquimod acted as an antagonist for adenosine receptor A(1) and induced a host antiviral protein, cystatin A. The process occurred independently of TLR7 and type I IFNs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f92","authors":["Toshiharu Yamashita"],"doi":"10.1128\/jvi.01196-12","first_seen_on":"2012-07-17T07:54:41+00:00","issns":["1098-5514"],"journal":"Journal of Virology","last_mentioned_on":1342511666,"links":["http:\/\/jvi.asm.org\/content\/early\/2012\/07\/05\/JVI.01196-12.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jvi.asm.org\/content\/early\/2012\/07\/05\/JVI.01196-12.full.pdf","pmid":"22787201","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Imiquimod Suppresses Propagation of Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 by Upregulation of Cystatin A via the Adenosine Receptor A1 Pathway","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/imiquimod-suppresses-propagation-herpes-simplex-virus-1-upregulation-cystatin-via-adenosine-receptor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630565,"mean":4.929464153233,"rank":2015561,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":942193,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630565,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66120,"mean":5.0521883271071,"rank":31282,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":23901,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66120,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4381,"mean":3.0027529680365,"rank":2181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1283,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4381,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71,"mean":1.4623714285714,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
