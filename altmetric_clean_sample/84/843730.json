The present report evaluated the frequency and predictors of a freeze response in the context of a biological challenge. A nonclinical sample (N=404) underwent a 20-s inhalation of 20% CO(2)\/balance O(2). Perceptions of immobility in the context of the challenge were reported in 13% of the sample, compared with 20% reporting a significant desire to flee. Subjective anxiety and panic during the challenge were associated with the freeze response, as were a number of anxiety symptom dimensions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cbd","authors":["Norman B.
