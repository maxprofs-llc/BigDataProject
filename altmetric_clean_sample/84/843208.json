Cleanascite\u2122"],"citation":{"abstract":"On-line comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography techniques promise to resolve samples that current one-dimensional liquid chromatography methods cannot adequately deal with. To make full use of the potential of two-dimensional liquid chromatography, optimization is required. Optimization of two-dimensional liquid chromatography is a relatively new yet important research topic the aim of which is to predict combinations of stationary and mobile phases, column formats, and chromatographic conditions that maximize resolving power and minimize analysis time. In on-line two-dimensional liquid chromatography, dilution-related issues play also an important role and these should be taken into account when developing optimization strategies. In this work, state-of-the-art strategies that support method development for on-line two-dimensional liquid chromatography through a rigorous choice of chromatographic parameters are critically reviewed. The final aim is to provide practitioners with a clear understanding of which aspects can be optimized using current on-line two-dimensional liquid chromatography strategies (and which ones cannot). In two-dimensional liquid chromatography, maximizing resolving power for a given analysis time and dilution requires optimizing efficiency, selectivity and retention. While great strides forward have been made in the optimization of efficiency-related issues, considerable effort needs still to be made in terms of (1) developing models that can predict the retention factors that given stationary\/mobile phase systems can provide and (2) using this information for choosing the two ones that maximize two-dimensional liquid chromatography orthogonality. Because of this limitation, in two-dimensional liquid chromatography, this aspect is typically dealt with a posteriori through examining chromatograms. This review clearly shows that important progress in the optimization of on-line two-dimensional liquid chromatography has recently been made.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e43","authors":["Bedani, Filippo","Schoenmakers, Peter J.","Janssen, Hans\u2010Gerd"],"doi":"10.1002\/jssc.201200070","endpage":"1711","first_seen_on":"2012-07-17T09:30:11+00:00","issns":["1615-9314","1615-9306"],"issue":"14","journal":"Journal of Separation Science (JSS) (formerly Journal of High Resolution Chromatography)","last_mentioned_on":1342517393,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jssc.201200070\/abstract;jsessionid=ABCB20BEE9A7CFF4AF95EC6D57B3B863.d02t03"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jssc.201200070\/pdf","pmid":"22807354","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1697","subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Theories to support method development in comprehensive two\u00e2\u0080\u0090dimensional liquid chromatography A review","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/theories-support-method-development-comprehensive-twodimensional-liquid-chromatography-review-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6324436,"mean":5.9767388233103,"rank":4673999,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":942699,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6324436,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75106,"mean":5.863125331203,"rank":49704,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":13373,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75106,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":719,"mean":1.062782729805,"rank":216,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":103,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":719,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":0.484375,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
