We hypothesized that administering an abbreviated California Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II) would detect verbal memory problems in MS accurately, thus serving as a potential screening tool. We performed receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analyses of three trials (trial 1, trial 2, and trial 1+2 combined) for raw data against standardized total scores. The results showed that at 1.5 standard deviations (SD) from the mean, the first two trials were 96.3% accurate, while at 2 SD from the mean, the first two trials combined were 97.5% accurate. We conclude that this study demonstrates than an abbreviated CVLT-II is a valid screening tool for verbal memory impairments.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5083cf058f61000312e","authors":["Frederick W Foley","Elizabeth S Gromisch","Vance Zemon","Ralph HB Benedict","Nancy D Chiaravalloti","John DeLuca","Mary A Picone","Sonya Kim"],"doi":"10.1177\/1352458512454347","endpage":"501","first_seen_on":"2012-07-18T03:23:15+00:00","issns":["1477-0970","1352-4585"],"issue":"4","journal":"Multiple Sclerosis (13524585)","last_mentioned_on":1342581773,"links":["http:\/\/msj.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2012\/07\/17\/1352458512454347.abstract?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/msj.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2012\/07\/17\/1352458512454347.full.pdf","pmid":"22807235","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"498","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Using a highly abbreviated California Verbal Learning Test-II to detect verbal memory deficits","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/using-highly-abbreviated-california-verbal-learning-testii-detect-verbal-memory-deficits"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506762,"mean":5.1233691071599,"rank":3107466,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":974734,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506762,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75038,"mean":5.193961379053,"rank":48684,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":17075,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75038,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1287,"mean":4.3106858475894,"rank":1038,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":140,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1287,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":5.272,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
