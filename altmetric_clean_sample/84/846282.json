This study used a shorter version of the Inventory of Beliefs about Wife Beating (IBWB) to measure women's attitude towards intimate partner violence. The results revealed that the mean score on the wife-beating scale of 15 items was 7.81 (SD = 4.893). Significant amounts of the variance (42.9%) in women's attitude towards intimate partner violence can be attributed to respondent's education (B = -0.60, p < 0.001), husband's education (B = -1.251, p < 0.01), exposure to mass media (B = -1.251, p < 0.01), respondent's current age (B = 0.081, p < 0.05), age at marriage (B = 0.215, p < 0.01), intimate partner violence victimization within the last 12 months (B = -1.533, p < 0.001) and women receiving micro-credit (small-scale loan or financial assistance) (B = -2.214, p < 0.001). The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the findings.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4de3cf058f610001cbb","authors":["Sayem AM","Begum HA","Moneesha SS"],"doi":"10.1017\/s0021932012000223","first_seen_on":"2012-07-18T21:33:30+00:00","issns":["0021-9320"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Biosocial Science","last_mentioned_on":1342647186,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22687269"],"pmid":"22687269","pubdate":"2012-06-14T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["socialsciences"],"title":"ATTITUDES TOWARDS JUSTIFYING INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE AMONG MARRIED WOMEN IN BANGLADESH.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/attitudes-towards-justifying-intimate-partner-violence-among-married-women-bangladesh-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629407,"mean":4.9349111287126,"rank":2016215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":939425,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629407,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72045,"mean":4.8675164344012,"rank":33740,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":26180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72045,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":165,"mean":3.170987804878,"rank":92,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":165,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.7916666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
