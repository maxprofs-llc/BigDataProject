We submitted paired SAT and VAT samples from six morbidly obese patients and six non-obese persons to two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization-time-of-flight\/time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Compared with non-obese subjects, obese patients presented with increased carboxylesterase-1, zinc finger protein 324A, annexin A5, ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase, \u03b1-crystallin B chain, osteoglycin, retinal dehydrogenase-1 and 14-3-3 protein \u03b3, and decreased transferrin, complement C3, fibrinogen \u03b3 chain, albumin, \u03b11-antitrypsin and peroxiredoxin-6, irrespective of the adipose tissue depot studied. SAT and VAT differed in protein species of fibrinogen and osteoglycin, whereas adipose tissue depot and obesity interacted on the protein abundance of actin, \u03b1-actinin 1, one protein species of carboxylesterase-1, retinal dehydrogenase-1 and 14-3-3 protein \u03b3. Our nontargeted proteomic approach identified novel protein species that may be involved in the development of obesity in humans.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f61000310e","authors":["Mar\u00eda Insenser","Rafael Montes-Nieto","Nuria Vilarrasa","Albert Lecube","Rafael Sim\u00f3","Joan Vendrell","H\u00e9ctor F.
