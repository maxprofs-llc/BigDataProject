These anticancer delivery platforms have been developed with the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect as a central mechanism for tumor targeting. EPR based nanomedicine has demonstrated, beyond doubt, to selectively target tumor tissues in animal models. However, over the last two decades, only nine anticancer agents utilizing this targeting strategy have been approved for clinical use. In this review, we systematically analyze various aspects that explain the limited clinical progress yet achieved. The influence of nanomedicine physicochemical characteristics, animal tumor models, and variations in tumor biology, on EPR based tumor targeting is closely examined. Furthermore, we reviewed results from over one hundred publications to construct patterns of factors that can influence the transition of EPR based anticancer nanomedicine to the clinic.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d37","authors":["Sebastien Taurin","Hayley Nehoff","Khaled Greish"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jconrel.2012.07.013","first_seen_on":"2012-07-17T09:56:08+00:00","issns":["01683659"],"journal":"Journal of Controlled Release","last_mentioned_on":1342518951,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0168365912005536?v=s5"],"pmid":"22800576","pubdate":"2012-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"title":"Anticancer Nanomedicine and Tumor Vascular Permeability; Where is the missing link?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/anticancer-nanomedicine-tumor-vascular-permeability-missing-link"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630112,"mean":4.9307700568987,"rank":2899884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":79089,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630112,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66118,"mean":5.0560852730764,"rank":48637,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":360,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66118,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1447,"mean":1.8828520055325,"rank":857,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1447,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":1.5224057971014,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":5,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Researcher":21,"Student  > Ph.
