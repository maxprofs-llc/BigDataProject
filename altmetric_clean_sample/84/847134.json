In complement to traditional biochemical techniques, noninvasive resonance energy transfer (RET) and protein-fragment complementation assays (PCAs) now allow protein interactions to be detected in the context of living cells. In this review, fluorescent and bioluminescent PCAs are discussed and their application illustrated with studies on GPCR signaling. Newly developed techniques combining PCA and RET assays for the detection of ternary and quaternary protein complexes are also presented.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081e7","authors":["Val J.
