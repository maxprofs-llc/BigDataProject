We surmised that defective placentation in IUGR dysregulates cellular bioenergic homeostasis, leading to increased autophagy in the villous trophoblast. The aims of this work were (1) to compare the differences in autophagy, p53 expression, and apoptosis between placentas of women with normal or IUGR pregnancies; (2) to study the effects of hypoxia and the role of p53 in regulating trophoblast autophagy; and (3) to investigate the relationship between autophagy and apoptosis in hypoxic trophoblasts.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Tai-Ho Hung","Szu-Fu Chen","Liang-Ming Lo","Meng-Jen Li","Yi-Lin Yeh","T\u2019sang-T\u2019ang Hsieh"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0040957","first_seen_on":"2012-07-16T21:03:20+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"7","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1420260017,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0040957","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0040957","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0040957"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0040957.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3397998","pmid":"22815878","pubdate":"2012-07-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e40957","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Increased Autophagy in Placentas of Intrauterine Growth-Restricted Pregnancies","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increased-autophagy-placentas-intrauterine-growthrestricted-pregnancies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691823,"mean":5.4318361211662,"rank":2254520,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2302407,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691823,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76042,"mean":5.3474786759774,"rank":32400,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":41129,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76042,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82601,"mean":8.8127636077483,"rank":41645,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":36666,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82601,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3257,"mean":6.5538390663391,"rank":1643,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":1436,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3257,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
