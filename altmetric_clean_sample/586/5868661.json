The initial physical impact triggers a cascade of molecular and cellular events that generate a non-permissive environment for cell survival and axonal regeneration. Spinal cord injured patients often arrive at the clinic hours (hrs) after the initial insult. This indicates the need to study and develop treatments with a long therapeutic window of action and multi-active properties, which target the complex set of events that arise after the initial trauma. We provide evidence that Tamoxifen (TAM), an FDA approved drug, exerts neuroprotective effects in an animal model when applied up-to 24 hrs after SCI. We hypothesized that continuous TAM administration will improve functional locomotor recovery, by favoring myelin preservation and reducing secondary damage after SCI. Adult female Sprague Dawley rats (~230 g) received a moderate contusion to the thoracic (T9-T10) spinal cord, using the MASCIS impactor device. In order to determine the therapeutic window available for TAM treatment, rats were implanted with TAM pellets (15 mg) immediately or 24 hrs after SCI. Locomotor function (BBB open field test, grid-walk and beam crossing tests) was assessed weekly for 35 days post-injury. TAM-treated rats showed significant functional locomotor recovery and improved fine movements when treated immediately or 24 hrs after SCI. Furthermore, TAM increased white matter preservation and reduced secondary damage caused by astrogliosis, axonal degeneration and cell death after trauma. These results provide evidence for TAM as a potential therapeutic agent to treat SCI up-to 24 hrs after the trauma.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e7b","authors":["Colon, Jennifer M","Torrado, Aranza Isabel","Cajigas, Ambar","Santiago, Jos\u00e9 Manuel","Salgado, Iris K","Arroyo, Yaria","Miranda, Jorge David"],"doi":"10.1089\/neu.2015.4111","first_seen_on":"2016-02-21T11:02:50+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms"],"issns":["1557-9042"],"journal":"Journal of Neurotrauma","last_mentioned_on":1456052553,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26896212?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26896212","pubdate":"2016-02-21T22:00:20+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Tamoxifen administration immediately or 24 hours after spinal cord injury improves locomotor recovery and reduces secondary damage in female rats","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tamoxifen-administration-immediately-24-hours-after-spinal-cord-injury-improves-locomotor-recovery-r"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7220962,"mean":6.3601386286362,"rank":3651494,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2051386,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7220962,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284157,"mean":10.355820098819,"rank":152701,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":101728,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284157,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":867,"mean":7.5392979214781,"rank":476,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":267,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":867,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":11.151576923077,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Ph.
