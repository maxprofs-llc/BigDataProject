Due to the lack of research in this area, a qualitative research design was employed. Interviews were conducted with 16 health professionals, 26 people with MS, and 11 family members of people who had MS. Adjusting to actual or threatened loss of income caused financial stress. These financial struggles led to a lower quality of life among respondents. Problem solving, coping, and positive reappraisal helped people to adjust to financial changes. Professionals focused on increased funding for services, whereas people with MS focused on improved income support. These findings highlight the need for professionals to consider the financial strain associated with this disease and the impact of this strain on the quality of life of individuals with MS and their families.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b23","authors":["De Judicibus, Margaret A","McCabe, Marita P","Margaret A.
