Crude mortality rates and age-adjusted mortality ratios by ward-unit were calculated. Demographic, residential environment, healthcare, and socioeconomic indicators were formulated for each of the ward-units between 1995 and 1998. Correlation and Poisson regression analyses were performed to examine the association between urban indicators and mortalities. The crude mortality rate by ward-unit in 1997 varied from 6.3 to 9.4 deaths per 1000 population. The age-adjusted mortality ratio in 1997 by ward-units as reference to the average mortality of urban China varied from 57.8 to 113.3 within Shanghai. Age-adjusted mortalities were inversely related with indicators of a larger floor space of dwellings per population, a larger proportion of parks, gardens, and green areas to total land area; a greater number of health professionals per population; and a greater number of employees in retail business per population. Spacious living showed independent association to a higher standard of community health in Shanghai (P < 0.05). Consequences of health policy and the developments of urban infrastructural resources from the viewpoint of the Healthy Cities concept were discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5933cf058f610004f67","authors":["Takehito Takano","Jia Fu","Keiko Nakamura","Kazuyuki Uji","Yoshiharu Fukuda","Masafumi Watanabe","Hiroshi Nakajima"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0168-8510(01)00234-2","first_seen_on":"2017-07-25T18:53:58+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["01688510","0168-8510"],"issue":"3","journal":"Health Policy","last_mentioned_on":1293840000,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0168-8510(01)00234-2"],"pmid":"12098518","pubdate":"2002-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Policy And Administration","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["healthservicesresearch","publichealth"],"title":"Age-adjusted mortality and its association to variations in urban conditions in Shanghai","type":"article","volume":"61","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ageadjusted-mortality-association-variations-urban-conditions-shanghai"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8078827,"mean":6.8937352751429,"rank":2033709,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4956816,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8078827,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96941,"mean":10.847676129565,"rank":29943,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":65992,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96941,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1139,"mean":4.9480333919156,"rank":384,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":437,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1139,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.8,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
