This study took advantage of the features of nanocrystals and direct compression technologies to develop a novel solid self-nanodispersion delivery system for andrographolide (Andro) in order to increase its dissolution rate for enhancing bioavailability. Andro nanosuspensions (Andro-NS) with a particle size of about 500\u00a0nm were prepared by homogenization technology and further converted into dried nanocrystal particles (Andro-NP) via spray-drying. The solid self-nanodispersion delivery system (Andro-SNDS)-loaded Andro-NP was prepared via direct compression technology. The DSC and PXRD results demonstrated that the Andro nanocrystals retained its original crystallinity. The dissolution of the Andro-SNDS formulation was 85.87% in pure water over 30\u00a0min, better than those of the coarse Andro and physical mixture of Andro and stabilizer. And the C max (299.32\u2009\u00b1\u200978.54\u00a0ng\/mL) and AUC0-\u221e (4440.55\u2009\u00b1\u2009764.13\u00a0mg\/L\u2009\u00b7\u2009h) of the Andro-SNDS formulation were significantly higher (p\u2009<\u20090.05) than those of the crude Andro (77.52\u2009\u00b1\u200931.73\u00a0ng\/mL and 1437.79\u2009\u00b1\u2009354.25\u00a0mg\/L\u2009\u00b7\u2009h). The AUC of the Andro-SNDS was 3.09 times as high as that of the crude Andro. This study illustrated a novel approach to combine the features of nanocrystals and composite particles used to improve oral bioavailability of poorly soluble drug.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067ed","authors":["Junnan Xu","Yueqin Ma","Yuanbiao Xie","Yingchong Chen","Yang Liu","Pengfei Yue","Ming Yang"],"doi":"10.1208\/s12249-016-0627-7","first_seen_on":"2016-11-04T16:30:41+00:00","issns":["1530-9932"],"journal":"AAPS PharmSciTech","last_mentioned_on":1478277023,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1208\/s12249-016-0627-7"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1208%2Fs12249-016-0627-7.pdf","pmid":"27620195","pubdate":"2016-09-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Design and Evaluation of Novel Solid Self-Nanodispersion Delivery System for Andrographolide.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/design-evaluation-novel-solid-selfnanodispersion-delivery-system-andrographolide"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7644999,"mean":6.5733031223765,"rank":5510594,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1861759,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7644999,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233927,"mean":12.835549883296,"rank":150568,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":72518,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233927,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":353,"mean":2.6111761363636,"rank":206,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":353,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":1.3357142857143,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":3}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AAPSComms\/statuses\/794577535300464640","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13344008],"posted_on":"2016-11-04T16:30:21+00:00","author":{"name":"AAPS","url":"http:\/\/www.aaps.org\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1922893266\/logo_aaps_5inches_72dpi_150x150_normal.png","description":"AAPS is an association of 9,000 members that advances the capacity of pharmaceutical scientists to develop products and therapies that improve global health.","id_on_source":"AAPSComms","tweeter_id":"122397315","geo":{"lt":38.88101,"ln":-77.10428,"country":"US"},"followers":2402},"tweet_id":"794577535300464640"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Timeline Photos","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1313034705375380&id=133899276622268","license":"public","citation_ids":[13344008],"posted_on":"2016-11-04T16:30:23+00:00","summary":"Novel solid self-nanodispersion delivery system for andrographolide to increase its dissolution rate for enhancing bioavailability.
