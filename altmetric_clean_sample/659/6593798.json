It is the most common type of syndromic hearing impairment with highly genetic heterogeneity and proved to be related by 6 genes as follows: PAX3, MITF, SNAI2, EDN3, EDNRB and SOX10. This article aims to identify the genetic causes of a Chinese WS child patient.\nA Chinese WS child was collected for clinical data collection by questionnaire survey. DNA samples of proband and his parents were extracted from peripheral blood samples. Six candidate genes were sequenced by the Trusight One sequencing panel on the illumina NextSeq 500 platform.\nA novel nonsense heterozygous mutation was found in the coding region of exon 2 in the SOX10 gene of proband. The novel nonsense heterozygous mutation could cause the replacement of the 55th lysine codon by stop codon (484T\u2009>\u2009C, C142R) and further more possibly cause terminating the protein translation in advance. However, both proband's parents had no mutation of genes above mentioned.\nThe gene mutation of SOX10 [NM_006941.3\u2009c.163A\u2009>\u2009T] is a novel nonsense mutation. No record of this mutation has been found in dbSNP, HGMD, 1000 Genomes Project, ClinVar and ESP6500 databases. It meets the condition of PS2 of strong evidence in 2015 ACMG Standards and Guidelines.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b88","authors":["Jing Ma","Tie-song Zhang","Ken Lin","Hao Sun","Hong-chao Jiang","Yan-li Yang","Fan Low","Ying-qin Gao","Biao Ruan","Tie-Song Zhang","Hong-Chao Jiang","Yan-Li Yang","Ying-Qin Gao","Ma, Jing","Zhang, Tie-Song","Lin, Ken","Sun, Hao","Jiang, Hong-Chao","Yang, Yan-Li","Low, Fan","Gao, Ying-Qin","Ruan, Biao"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijporl.2016.03.043","first_seen_on":"2016-04-10T05:52:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["01655876","1872-8464"],"journal":"International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology","last_mentioned_on":1464828849,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0165587616300465&_version=1&md5=dbab2f7777c4f7591bfd89ffd5c881b9","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27240497?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27240497","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["otolaryngology","pediatrics"],"title":"Waardenburg syndrome type II in a Chinese patient caused by a novel nonsense mutation in the SOX10 gene","type":"article","volume":"85","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/waardenburg-syndrome-type-ii-chinese-patient-caused-novel-nonsense-mutation-sox10-gene"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7847043,"mean":6.6493042501824,"rank":3823151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":3962701,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7847043,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":274211,"mean":11.3093798038,"rank":134726,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":136851,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":274211,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1695,"mean":1.9464781582054,"rank":533,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":1158,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1695,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":1.1178461538462,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":55,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
