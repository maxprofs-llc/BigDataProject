Nineteen EEG electrodes were placed on the scalp following the 10-20 system. These electrodes were then grouped into five recording regions corresponding to the scalp area of the cerebral cortex. Sixty-second WM task data were recorded from ten control subjects. Forty-five MWT basis functions from orthogonal families were investigated. These functions included Daubechies (db1-db20), Symlets (sym1-sym20), and Coiflets (coif1-coif5). Using ANOVA, we determined the MWT basis functions with the most significant differences in the ability of the five scalp regions to maximize their cross-correlation with the EEG signals. The best results were obtained using \"sym9\" across the five scalp regions. Therefore, the most compatible MWT with the EEG signals should be selected to achieve wavelet denoising, decomposition, reconstruction, and sub-band feature extraction. This study provides a reference of the selection of efficient MWT basis functions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5333cf058f6100045ba","authors":["Al-Qazzaz, Noor Kamal","Hamid Bin Mohd Ali, Sawal","Ahmad, Siti Anom","Islam, Mohd Shabiul","Escudero, Javier","Noor Al-Qazzaz","Sawal Hamid Bin Mohd Ali","Siti Ahmad","Mohd Islam","Javier Escudero"],"doi":"10.3390\/s151129015","endpage":"29035","first_seen_on":"2016-04-10T00:03:34+00:00","issns":["1424-8220"],"issue":"11","journal":"Sensors (14248220)","last_mentioned_on":1483656597,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26593918"],"pmid":"26593918","pubdate":"2015-11-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"29015","subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Selection of Mother Wavelet Functions for Multi-Channel EEG Signal Analysis during a Working Memory Task","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/15\/11\/29015","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/selection-mother-wavelet-functions-multichannel-eeg-signal-analysis-during-working-memory-task-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":2.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7987814,"mean":6.7359164730015,"rank":3192430,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4738247,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7987814,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275463,"mean":11.3337378731,"rank":99852,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":173153,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275463,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3310,"mean":1.8834717437292,"rank":454,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":2829,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3310,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167,"mean":1.303313253012,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":147,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
