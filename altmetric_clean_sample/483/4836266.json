We report clinical and pathological features of a 40-year-old woman with laryngeal paraganglioma. Tracheotomy combined with vein anesthesia was performed to isolate tumors. The patient was followed up for 3 months after surgery treatment and recovered well. We also provide a better understanding of this disease through a review of relevant literature. Largnx paraganglioma is rare, but should require long-term follow-up for possible recurrence.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8203cf058f61000bc2a","authors":["Zhou, Xueqin","Jiang, Shuai","Li, Hong"],"first_seen_on":"2015-12-03T11:08:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1940-5901"],"issue":"9","journal":"International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1449140902,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26629246?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC4659134","pmid":"26629246","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"A case of laryngeal paraganglioma and literature review.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/case-laryngeal-paraganglioma-literature-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6644977,"mean":6.1548448788946,"rank":5670097,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6644977,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278472,"mean":8.5684781108264,"rank":224371,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278472,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":946,"mean":1.4078687830688,"rank":476,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":946,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.36125,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/statuses\/672371792632156161","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4836266],"posted_on":"2015-12-03T11:08:22+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
