It also highlights some clinical benefits, but also uncertainties, of biomarker use.\nDrug-induced AKI is traditionally diagnosed by monitoring serum creatinine (SCr), blood urea nitrogen and albuminuria. The sensitivity of these measures is, however, limited to well-established AKI. Application of selected biomarkers for early diagnosis of drug-induced AKI may inform on progression of AKI and alert clinicians to adopt renoprotective strategies at the earliest times. Novel biomarkers, accepted for early detection of drug-induced AKI (kidney injury molecule-1, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and N-acetyl-\u03b2-d-glucosaminidase), may be useful additions in panels of biomarkers. Clinical biomarkers of cell cycle arrest, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 show promise but need further validation in clinical trials.\nTraditional parameters, such as SCr, provide some guidance for functional decline in drug-induced AKI but early, more sensitive, affordable, clinically acceptable, biomarkers of kidney dysfunction are needed. Basic biological understanding of AKI will improve with high-throughput methodologies such as proteomics and metabolomics, and this should lead to identification and usage of novel biomarkers. Ultimately, a combination of biomarkers indicating kidney dysfunction and damage is likely to be required.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073c2","authors":["Glenda C Gobe","Gobe, Glenda C","Coombes, Jeff S","Fassett, Robert G","Endre, Zoltan H"],"doi":"10.1517\/17425255.2015.1083011","endpage":"1694","first_seen_on":"2015-12-03T00:03:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1744-7607","1742-5255"],"issue":"11","journal":"Expert Opinion on Drug Metabolism & Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1449101016,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1517\/17425255.2015.1083011?ai=1lm3u&mi=ianpxd&af=R"],"pmid":"26548752","pubdate":"2015-09-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"1683","subjects":["metabolism"],"title":"Biomarkers of drug-induced acute kidney injury in the adult","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biomarkers-druginduced-acute-kidney-injury-adult"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6644977,"mean":6.1548448788946,"rank":5670088,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6644977,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278472,"mean":8.5684958864655,"rank":224368,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278472,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":640,"mean":1.449696400626,"rank":498,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":640,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":1.9861111111111,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
