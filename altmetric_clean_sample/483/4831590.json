We aimed to evaluate whether the combination of bisphosphonates with tyrosine kinase inhibitors of EGFR (EGFR-TKIs) could obtain a synergistic effect on advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations.\nBetween January 2008 and October 2013, 114 advanced EGFR mutations NSCLC patients who received EGFR-TKIs as first-line therapy were recruited from two cancer centers. Patients were separated into EGFR-TKIs alone or EGFR-TKIs plus bisphosphonates (combination) group. Median progression free survival (mPFS), median overall survival (mOS) distributions and survival curves were analyzed.\nAmong the 114 patients, 62 had bone metastases (19 patients treated with EGFR-TKIs, 43 patients treated with EGFR-TKIs + bisphosphonates). Median PFS and OS were significantly improved in combination group compared with EGFR-TKIs group (mPFS: 15.0 vs 7.3 months, P = 0.0017; mOS: 25.2 vs 10.4 months, P = 0.0015) in patients with bone metastases. Among the 71 patients (19 patients with bone metastases) treated with EGFR-TKIs alone, patients with bone metastases had poor survival prognosis (mPFS:7.3 vs 12.1 months, P = 0.0434; mOS:10.4 vs 22.0 months, P = 0.0036). The survival of patients with bone metastases who received EGFR-TKIs plus bisphosphonates therapy was non-inferior to patients without bone metastases treated with EGFR-TKIs alone (mPFS: 15.0 vs 12.1 months, p = 0.1871; mOS: 25.2 vs 22.0 months, p = 0.9798).\nConcomitant use of bisphosphonates and EGFR-TKIs improves therapeutic efficacy and brings survival benefits to NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation and bone metastases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Huang, Chu-Ying","Wang, Li","Feng, Cheng-Jun","Yu, Ping","Cai, Xiao-Hong","Yao, Wen-Xiu","Xu, Yong","Liu, Xiao-Ke","Zhu, Wen-Jiang","Wang, Yan","Zhou, Jin","Lu, You","Wang, Yong-Sheng"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.5515","first_seen_on":"2015-12-02T12:46:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1449639673,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26624882?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26624882"],"pmid":"26624882","pubdate":"2015-12-02T22:00:15+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Bisphosphonates enhance EGFR-TKIs efficacy in advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR activating mutation: A retrospective study.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bisphosphonates-enhance-egfrtkis-efficacy-advanced-nsclc-patients-egfr-activating-mutation-retrospec"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6717285,"mean":6.1598756482513,"rank":3019381,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3517283,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6717285,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279435,"mean":8.5961849238102,"rank":127594,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":139892,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279435,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6255,"mean":2.2469872081868,"rank":1339,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":4474,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6255,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":824,"mean":1.2770522478736,"rank":158,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":590,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":824,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"reddit":[{"title":"Bisphosphonates enhance EGFR-TKIs efficacy in advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR activating mutation: A retrospective study.","url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nsclc\/comments\/3w1e0v\/bisphosphonates_enhance_egfrtkis_efficacy_in\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[4831590],"posted_on":"2015-12-09T05:41:13+00:00","author":{"name":"montaukwhaler","url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nsclc","id_on_source":"nsclc","followers":1,"subreddit":"non small cell lung cancer"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/dermatologyf\/statuses\/672014153171648512","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4831590],"posted_on":"2015-12-02T11:27:14+00:00","author":{"name":"dermatologyf","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2046835740\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Dermatology News","id_on_source":"dermatologyf","tweeter_id":"546505902","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":58},"tweet_id":"672014153171648512"}]}}
