Knowing which modifiable physical characteristics predict dynamic postural stability can help direct rehabilitation and injury prevention programs.\nTo determine if trunk, hip, knee, and ankle flexibility and strength variables are significant predictors of dynamic postural stability during single-leg jump landings.\nCross-sectional study.\nLaboratory environment.\nNinety-four male Soldiers (age = 28.2 \u00b1 6.2 years, height = 176.5 \u00b1 2.6 cm, weight = 83.7 \u00b1 26.0 kg) agreed to participate.\nNo intervention provided.\nAnkle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion range of motion were assessed with a goniometer. Trunk, hip, knee, and ankle strength were assessed with an isokinetic dynamometer or hand-held dynamometer. The dynamic postural stability index (DPSI) was used to quantify postural stability. Simple linear and backwards stepwise regression analyses were used to identify which physical characteristic variables were significant predictors of DPSI.\nSimple linear regression analysis revealed that individually no variables were significant predictors of the DPSI. Stepwise backward regression analysis revealed that ankle dorsiflexion flexibility, ankle inversion and eversion strength, and knee flexion and extension strength were significant predictors of the DPSI (R2=0.19, p=0.0016, Adjusted R2=0.15).\nAnkle dorsiflexion range of motion, ankle inversion and eversion strength, and knee flexion and extension strength were identified as significant predictors of dynamic postural stability, explaining a small amount of the variance in the DPSI.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f37","authors":["Williams, Valerie J","Nagai, Takashi","Sell, Timothy C","Abt, John P","Rowe, Russell S","McGrail, Mark A","Lephart, Scott M","Valerie J.
