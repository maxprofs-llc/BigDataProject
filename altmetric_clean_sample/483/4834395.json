The fundamental differences of devices supporting telementoring create threats for the perception and interpretation of the transmitted video, highlighting the necessity of exploring hardware usability aspects in a safety critical surgical mentoring scenario.\nThree types of devices, based on the screen size, formed the arms for the randomized controlled trial. Streaming video recordings of a laparoscopic procedure to the mentors imitated the mentoring scenario. User preferences and response times were recorded while participating in a session performed on all devices.\nMedian response to a mentoring request times were similar for mobile platforms; expected durations were considerably longer for stationary computer. Ability to perceive and identify anatomical structures was insignificantly lower on small sized devices. Stationary and tablet platforms were nearly equally preferred by the most of participants as default telementoring hardware.\nAs a side effect, incompatibility of daily duties of the surgeons in the hospital and telementoring responsibilities while implementing systems locally was identified. Scaling up the use of the service in combination with the organizational changes of clinical staff looks like a promising solution.\nThe trial demonstrated the feasibility of using all three types of devices for the purpose of mentoring, allowing users to choose the preferred platform. The paper provided initial results on the quality assurance of telementoring systems imposed by the regulatory documents.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b70","authors":["Budrionis, Andrius","Hartvigsen, Gunnar","Lindsetmo, Rolv-Ole","Bellika, Johan Gustav"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijmedinf.2015.05.004","first_seen_on":"2015-12-02T23:05:59+00:00","issns":["1872-8243","1386-5056"],"issue":"9","journal":"International Journal of Medical Informatics","last_mentioned_on":1449097538,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1386505615000970"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ijmijournal.com\/article\/S1386505615000970\/pdf","pmid":"26048739","pubdate":"2015-01-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"715","subjects":["medicalinformatics"],"title":"What device should be used for telementoring?
