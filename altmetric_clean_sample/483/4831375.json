This device is composed of a transparent double-layered polymer sheet of ethylene-vinyl alcohol (EVOH) and poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) having an array of microhole structures of 90 \u03bcm diameter and 50 \u03bcm depth on its surface. All the microhole structures were equipped with a 1-\u03bcm-thick optical chemical sensing layer of platinum porphyrin-fluoropolymer on their bottom. The three-dimensional microstructures of the sensor were fabricated by a newly developed simple and low-cost production method named self-aligned hot embossing. The device was designed to be attached slightly above the cells cultivated on a dish to form a temporarily closed microspace over the target cells during measurement. Since the change in oxygen concentration is relatively fast in the microcompartmentalized culture medium, a rapid evaluation of the oxygen consumption rate is possible by measuring the phosphorescence lifetime of the platinum porphyrin-fluoropolymer. The combined use of the device and an automated optical measurement system enabled the high-throughput sensing of cellular oxygen consumption (100 points\/min). We monitored the oxygen metabolism of the human breast cancer cell line MCF7 on a Petri dish and evaluated the oxygen consumption rate to be 0.72 \u00b1 0.12 fmol\/min\/cell. Furthermore, to demonstrate the utility of the developed sensing system, we demonstrated the mapping of the oxygen consumption rate of rat brain slices and succeeded in visualizing a clear difference among the layer structures of the hippocampus, i.e., the cornu ammonis (CA1 and CA3) and dentate gyrus (DG).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Kojima, Mari","Takehara, Hiroaki","Akagi, Takanori","Shiono, Hirofumi","Ichiki, Takanori"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0143774","first_seen_on":"2015-12-02T11:55:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"12","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1451879040,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26624889?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26624889","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0143774","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0143774"],"pmid":"26624889","pubdate":"2015-12-02T22:00:15+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Flexible Sheet-Type Sensor for Noninvasive Measurement of Cellular Oxygen Metabolism on a Culture Dish","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/flexible-sheettype-sensor-noninvasive-measurement-cellular-oxygen-metabolism-culture-dish"},"altmetric_score":{"score":21.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":21.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6905088,"mean":6.197633439229,"rank":297446,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":6607135,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6905088,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282407,"mean":8.6438117462093,"rank":18275,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":264108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282407,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102062,"mean":9.9346890585044,"rank":7606,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":94444,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102062,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4944,"mean":10.464855755614,"rank":348,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":4595,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4944,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
