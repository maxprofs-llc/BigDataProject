Volatiles were extracted directly from the pack, using solid phase microextraction and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Sensory evaluation and microbiological analysis of the meat surface were also performed. Commercial samples of vacuum packed lamb legs (n=85), from two meat processing plants, were kept for 7weeks at -1.5\u00b0C then at different regimes of temperature (-1.5 to +4\u00b0C) until 11, 12 or 13weeks. Persistent odour was observed in 66% of samples, confinement odour in 24% and no odour in 11%. Volatiles associated with confinement odour (3-methyl-butanal, 3-hydroxy-2-butanone and sulphur dioxide) corresponded with end\/sub products of glucose fermentation and catabolism of amino acids by bacteria (all bacteria naturally found in meat and do not represent a risk to health). Confinement odour could indicate a stage at which the environment for bacteria growth is becoming favourable for the production of volatiles with strong odours that are noticed by the consumer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5023cf058f610003081","authors":["Reis, Marlon M","Reis, Mariza G","Mills, John","Ross, Colleen","Brightwell, Gale"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.meatsci.2015.11.017","first_seen_on":"2015-12-02T14:42:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-4138"],"journal":"Meat Science","last_mentioned_on":1449064992,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26624794?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26624794","pubdate":"2015-12-02T22:00:19+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Characterization of volatile metabolites associated with confinement odour during the shelf-life of vacuum packed lamb meat under different storage conditions.","type":"article","volume":"113","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterization-volatile-metabolites-associated-confinement-odour-during-shelflife-vacuum-packed-la"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6640754,"mean":6.1509604181908,"rank":5666635,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6640754,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253670,"mean":9.1929365984806,"rank":200907,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253670,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":424,"mean":4.1623735224586,"rank":331,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":424,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":3.8065454545455,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
