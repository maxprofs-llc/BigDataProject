For example, although onychomycosis is uncommon in children, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis when young patients have nail changes, particularly if a family history of onychomycosis is present. In elderly patients, comorbid medical conditions may complicate systemic treatment, and physical impairments may interfere with topical therapy. Nondermatophyte molds and yeasts should be considered as possible pathogens in patients with diabetes and psoriasis. Patients who are immunosuppressed for any reason are at increased risk for nail infections.
