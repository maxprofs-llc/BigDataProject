We describe the most common clinical manifestations as cerebellar ataxia, gluten encephalopathy, multiple sclerosis, peripheral neuropathies, sensorineural hearing loss, epilepsy, headache, depression, cognitive deficiencies and other less described clinical conditions. Our aim is to perform, as more as possible, a review about the most recent update on the topics in international literature. It is important to consider clinical neurological manifestations in celiac patients and to research these conditions also in the follow-up because they may start also one year after the start of gluten free diet (GFD) as peripheral neuropathy. The association with autism is analysed and possible new association with non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) are considered.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081b1","authors":["Casella, G","Bordo, B M","Schalling, R","Villanacci, V","Salemme, M","Di Bella, C","Baldini, V","Bassotti, G"],"first_seen_on":"2015-12-02T09:33:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1827-1642"],"journal":"Minerva Gastroenterologica E Dietologica","last_mentioned_on":1480300145,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26619901","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26619901?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26619901"],"pmid":"26619901","pubdate":"2015-12-02T22:02:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Neurological disorders and celiac disease.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neurological-disorders-celiac-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8071560,"mean":6.8509889435193,"rank":3681155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4310312,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8071560,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":296809,"mean":8.9311237298184,"rank":119183,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":172414,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":296809,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90,"mean":1.7849213483146,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":70,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":2.5,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Sports and Recreations":1,"Psychology":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Computer Science":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"US":2},"mendeley":{"DK":1,"PL":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PaulWhiteleyPhD\/statuses\/671985483099086848","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4830838],"posted_on":"2015-12-02T09:33:18+00:00","author":{"name":"Paul Whiteley","url":"http:\/\/questioning-answers.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000344449848\/35f9d576889f4cf18b0bcf1f367afa4f_normal.jpeg","description":"Autism research, research blogging & tweeting & health science stuff.
