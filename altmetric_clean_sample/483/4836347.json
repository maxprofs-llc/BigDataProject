The Ce of rocuronium for intubation was 3 \u03bcg\u00b7ml(-1) in both groups, and the Ce during operation were 0.8 and 1.0 \u03bcg\u00b7ml(-1) in group A and B, respectively. When target controlled infusion of rocuronium was stopped, without the administration of reversal agents for neuromuscular blockade, the relationship between Ce and the first twitch height (T1) was studied by regression analysis.\nThere was a significant linear relationship between Ce and T1, and there was no statistical difference in regression coefficient and interception between group A and B (P>0.05).\nThe degree of recovery from neuromuscular blockade could be judged by the target effective site concentration of rocuronium at the time of reversal from neuromuscular blockade in the elderly patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8203cf058f61000bc2a","authors":["Fan, Xiaochong","Ma, Minyu","Li, Zhisong","Gong, Shengkai","Zhang, Wei","Wen, Yuanyuan"],"first_seen_on":"2015-12-03T11:13:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1940-5901"],"issue":"9","journal":"International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1449141206,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26629159?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC4659047","pmid":"26629159","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"The relationship between the target effective site concentration of rocuronium and the degree of recovery from neuromuscular blockade in elderly patients.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/relationship-between-target-effective-site-concentration-rocuronium-degree-recovery-neuromuscular-bl"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6644977,"mean":6.1548448788946,"rank":5670099,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6644977,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278472,"mean":8.5684804450013,"rank":224372,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278472,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":946,"mean":1.4078687830688,"rank":476,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":946,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.36125,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/statuses\/672373071173431296","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4836347],"posted_on":"2015-12-03T11:13:26+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
