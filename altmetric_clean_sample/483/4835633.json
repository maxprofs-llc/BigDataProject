Because there are some data about the impact of aniseed EO on drug effects, this survey aimed to assess the potential of pharmacokinetic herb-drug interaction between aniseed EO and acetaminophen and caffeine in mice. The chemical analysis (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) of aniseed EO has confirmed trans-anethole (87.96%) as the main component. The pharmacokinetic studies of intraperitoneally (i.p.) and orally applied acetaminophen (200\u2009mg\/kg) and caffeine (20\u2009mg\/kg) were performed in mice after 5\u2009days of oral treatment with human equivalent dose of aniseed EO (0.3\u2009mg\/kg\/day). The analysis of pharmacokinetic data showed that in the group treated by aniseed EO, the significant decrease in the peak plasma concentration of acetaminophen after oral application (p\u2009=\u20090.024) was revealed when compared with control group and the reduction of systemic exposure to the drug after oral application (74\u2009\u00b1\u200932% vs. 85\u2009\u00b1\u200935% in the control) was noted. The bioavailability of orally applied caffeine was also significantly decreased (p\u2009=\u20090.022) after the EO treatment in comparison with the control (57\u2009\u00b1\u200924% vs. 101\u2009\u00b1\u200929%). Therefore, the compromised therapeutic efficacy of acetaminophen and caffeine during the usage of aniseed EO preparations should be considered.
