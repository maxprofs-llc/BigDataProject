The present study assessed the candidate factors that may influence decisions regarding postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy in females with early-stage breast cancer. Patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between January 2000 and December 2007 were enrolled in the study. Information about the patients, including socio-demographic factors, clinicopathological characteristics and receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy, was obtained from their medical records. Overall, 434 out of 1,296 (33.5%) patients with breast cancer decided against receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. Receipt of chemotherapy was significantly associated with the age of the patient at the time of diagnosis (P=0.029), occupational type (P=0.023), and lymph node status (P<0.001). Moderate associations were also observed between receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy and the patients family history of cancer (P=0.055) and hormone-receptor status (P=0.075). The results of the present study suggest that the occupational type of the patient is associated with receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy in China. This observation may provide a novel strategy for physicians to improve patients compliance regarding adjuvant chemotherapy. Further studies in additional developing countries are required in order to validate these observations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f61000837d","authors":["Zhu, Zhengzhi","Huo, Qiang","Wang, Shengying","Yang, Qifeng"],"doi":"10.3892\/ol.2015.3571","first_seen_on":"2015-12-02T11:53:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1792-1074"],"issue":"4","journal":"Oncology Letters","last_mentioned_on":1449054581,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26622887?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26622887","pubdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Occupational type affects the receipt of breast cancer adjuvant chemotherapy in China.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/occupational-type-affects-receipt-breast-cancer-adjuvant-chemotherapy-china"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6640754,"mean":6.1509604181908,"rank":5666608,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6640754,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253671,"mean":9.1929052863955,"rank":200902,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253671,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1001,"mean":1.35714,"rank":503,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1001,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109,"mean":0.7137037037037,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/672009737072828416","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4831347],"posted_on":"2015-12-02T11:09:41+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":713},"tweet_id":"672009737072828416"}]}}
