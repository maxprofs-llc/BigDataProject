Concomitant with this use is an increase in materials related research on medically used polymers. Information on the historical and current clinical use of polymeric materials is provided in order to establish a basis for the philosophy and problems encountered in assessing the acceptability of various polymers in the biological system. The requisite properties which must be demonstrated by a polymer in contact with the body are discussed from two viewpoints, i.e., the effects of the material on the stability of the host and the effects of the host on the stability of the material. In addition, the effects of synthesis, processing, storage, sterilization, implantation, and possible degradation of polymers are discussed, poly(ethylene terephthalate) being used as an example.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027e9","authors":["R N King","D J Lyman"],"first_seen_on":"2015-12-03T19:52:32+00:00","issns":["0091-6765"],"journal":"Environmental Health Perspectives","last_mentioned_on":1449172333,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1475190\/pdf\/envhper00495-0070.pdf"],"pdf_url":"\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1475190\/pdf\/envhper00495-0070.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1475190","pmid":"126150","pubdate":"1975-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Institute of Environmental Health Science","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"71","subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Polymers in contact with the body.","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/polymers-contact-body"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6644977,"mean":6.1548448788946,"rank":4916399,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":974905,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6644977,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278472,"mean":8.5684676968156,"rank":187715,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":54087,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278472,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2978,"mean":12.025774941216,"rank":2563,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":267,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2978,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":36.202692307692,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
