Current otolaryngology funding mechanisms and up-to-date resources are provided. The review is aimed to assist otolaryngology residents, faculty new to the grant process, as well as experienced researchers striving to improve their grant review scores.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005c01","authors":["Jeffrey C.
