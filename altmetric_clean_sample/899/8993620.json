In preparation for genome-wide association mapping (GWAM) of sclerotinia resistance in B. napus, 152 accessions from diverse geographical regions were screened with a single Canadian isolate, #321. Plants were inoculated by attaching mycelium plugs to the main stem at full flower. Lesion lengths measured 7, 14 and 21\u00a0days after inoculation were used to calculate the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC). Depth of penetration was noted and used to calculate percent soft and collapsed lesions (% s\u00a0+\u00a0c). The two disease traits were highly correlated (r\u00a0=\u00a00.93). Partially resistant accessions (AUDPC <7 and % s\u00a0+\u00a0c <2) were identified primarily from South Korea and Japan with a few from Pakistan, China and Europe. Genotyping of accessions with 84 simple sequence repeat markers provided 690 polymorphic loci for GWAM. The general linear model in TASSEL best fitted the data when adjusted for population structure (STRUCTURE), GLM\u00a0+\u00a0Q. After correction for positive false discovery rate, 34 loci were significantly associated with both disease traits of which 21 alleles contributed to resistance, while the remaining enhanced susceptibility. The phenotypic variation explained by the loci ranged from 6 to 25\u00a0%. Five loci mapped to published quantitative trait loci conferring sclerotinia resistance in Chinese lines.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422a","authors":["Gyawali, Sanjaya","Harrington, Myrtle","Durkin, Jonathan","Horner, Kyla","Parkin, Isobel A P","Hegedus, Dwayne D","Bekkaoui, Diana","Buchwaldt, Lone"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11032-016-0496-5","first_seen_on":"2016-06-23T14:20:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1380-3743","1572-9788"],"issue":"6","journal":"Molecular Breeding","last_mentioned_on":1466687016,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27330402?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4889634","pmid":"27330402","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Genetics & Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Pathology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Physiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Sciences","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"Microsatellite markers used for genome-wide association mapping of partial resistance to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum in a world collection of Brassica napus","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microsatellite-markers-used-genomewide-association-mapping-partial-resistance-sclerotinia-sclerotior"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7936934,"mean":6.7106933012983,"rank":6870049,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7936934,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262309,"mean":11.568903739115,"rank":219668,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262309,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":154,"mean":4.998091503268,"rank":113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":154,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":44.292222222222,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
