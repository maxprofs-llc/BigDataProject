Descriptive analyses were conducted to determine the distribution of worker\/employment\/incident characteristics.\nWorkplace physical violence that resulted in a TBI accounted for 6.6% percent of all TBI injury claims. Female workers, primarily in the health care\/social services sector, accounted for over half of all TBIs. Most workers were assaulted by consumers\/clients. Forty five percent of injuries occurred among workers with less than 3 years of employment.\nThis paper identifies profiles of workers and workplaces for targeted preventive efforts. Future studies are needed to further address risk factors by sex and outcomes, such as length of disability and health care cost.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5683cf058f610004ae1","authors":["Mollayeva, Tatyana","Mollayeva, Shirin","Lewko, John","Colantonio, Angela"],"doi":"10.3233\/wor-162339","first_seen_on":"2016-06-23T14:36:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1875-9270","1051-9815"],"issue":"2","journal":"Work","last_mentioned_on":1466690085,"links":["http:\/\/content.iospress.com\/articles\/work\/wor2339"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/content.iospress.com\/download\/work\/wor2339?id=work%2Fwor2339","pmid":"27315416","pubdate":"2016-06-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"IOS Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mechanical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["occupationalmedicine"],"title":"Work related traumatic brain injury due\u00a0to\u00a0assault.","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sex-differences-workrelated-traumatic-brain-injury-due-assault"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7936934,"mean":6.7106933012983,"rank":6017825,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1066941,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7936934,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262308,"mean":11.568897139611,"rank":183724,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":42641,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262308,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":416,"mean":3.892843373494,"rank":291,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":64,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":416,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.80555555555556,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
