Starting in 1991 with follow-up health assessments every two to three years, cognition was measured using the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI). For this study, health data was used to construct an accumulation of deficits frailty index (FI). Using six waves of data, multilevel growth curve analyses were constructed to examine simultaneous changes in cognition in relation to changes in FI, controlling for baseline frailty, age, education, and APOE-\u025b4 status.\nOn average, CASI scores declined by 2.0 points per year (95% confidence interval 1.9-2.1). Across six waves, each 10% within-person increase in frailty from baseline was associated with a 5.0 point reduction in CASI scores (95% confidence interval 4.7-5.2). Baseline frailty and age were associated both with lower initial CASI scores and with greater decline across the five follow-up assessments (p\u200a< \u200a0.01).\nCognition is adversely affected by impaired health status in old age. Using a multidimensional measure of frailty, both baseline status and within-person changes in frailty were predictive of cognitive trajectories.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c7a","authors":["Armstrong, Joshua J.","Godin, Judith","Launer, Lenore J.","White, Lon R.","Mitnitski, Arnold","Rockwood, Kenneth","Andrew, Melissa K.","Armstrong, Joshua J","Launer, Lenore J","White, Lon R","Andrew, Melissa K"],"doi":"10.3233\/jad-151172","first_seen_on":"2016-06-23T14:05:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1875-8908","1387-2877"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Alzheimer's Disease","last_mentioned_on":1467768375,"links":["http:\/\/content.iospress.com\/articles\/journal-of-alzheimers-disease\/jad151172","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27314525"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/content.iospress.com\/download\/journal-of-alzheimers-disease\/jad151172?id=journal-of-alzheimers-disease%2Fjad151172","pmid":"27314525","pubdate":"2016-06-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"IOS Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["geriatrics","neurology"],"title":"Changes in Frailty Predict Changes in\u00a0Cognition in Older Men: The\u00a0Honolulu-Asia Aging Study.","type":"article","volume":"53","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/changes-frailty-predict-changes-cognition-older-men-honoluluasia-aging-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8002013,"mean":6.750266627688,"rank":636920,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7364071,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8002013,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263067,"mean":11.572472147674,"rank":31183,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":231789,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263067,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2378,"mean":14.713091291544,"rank":344,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":2030,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2378,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":142,"mean":16.517418439716,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":142,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Unspecified":1,"Arts and Humanities":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"CA":2},"mendeley":{"BR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Danbelsky\/statuses\/745954202556432384","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8992877],"posted_on":"2016-06-23T12:18:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Daniel Belsky","url":"http:\/\/sites.duke.edu\/danbelsky\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/881618314216308736\/k9GgvqnZ_normal.jpg","description":"Aging, Genes, Environment, Life Course Epidemiology","id_on_source":"Danbelsky","tweeter_id":"945095557","geo":{"lt":35.99403,"ln":-78.89862,"country":"US"},"followers":534},"tweet_id":"745954202556432384"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/josherArmstrong\/statuses\/750328922647113730","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8992877],"posted_on":"2016-07-05T14:02:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Joshua Armstrong","url":"http:\/\/scrumptiocity.wordpress.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/476847611513565184\/G-nmPt5H_normal.jpeg","description":"Appreciator of good food, fine ales, and excellent health;
