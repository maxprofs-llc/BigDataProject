Data on this disease remain scarce.\nRetrospective study of patients with relapsing polychondritis seen between 2000 and 2012 in a single center, to describe patient characteristics and disease evolution, identify prognostic factors and define different clinical phenotypes.\nWe included 142 patients with chondritis types (86 women [61%]; mean age at first symptoms 43.5\u00b115 years): auricular (89%, n=127), nasal (63%, n=89), laryngeal (43%, n=61), chondrocostal (40%, n=57) and\/or tracheobronchial (22%, n=32). The main other manifestations were articular (69%, n=98), ophthalmological (56%, n=80), cochleovestibular (34%, n=48), cardiac (27%, n=38), and cutaneous (29%, n=40). At a mean follow-up of 13\u00b19 years, the 5- and 10-year survival was 95\u00b12% and 91\u00b13%, respectively. Factors associated with death on multivariable analysis were male sex (P=0.01), cardiac abnormalities (P=0.03) and concomitant myelodysplasia (P=0.004) or another hematologic malignancy (P=0.01). Cluster analysis revealed that separating patients into 3 groups was clinically relevant, thereby isolating patients with associated myelodysplasia, those with tracheobronchial involvement and those without the 2 features in terms of clinical characteristics, therapeutic management and prognosis.\nThis large series of definite relapsing polychondritis revealed an improvement in survival as compared with previous studies. Factors associated with death were male sex, cardiac involvement, and concomitant hematologic malignancy. We identified 3 distinct phenotypes. This article is protected by copyright.
