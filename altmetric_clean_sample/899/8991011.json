The aim of this component of the trial was to understand participants' perspectives of study participation and preferences for the mode of delivery.\nA mixed-methods questionnaire was distributed to study participants 3 months after giving birth. The questionnaire contained Likert scales and open-ended questions about the experience of being enrolled in a clinical trial and of childbirth, including the mode of delivery. Quantitative data were analyzed using SAS to generate descriptive statistics. Qualitative data were analyzed to identify categories and themes.\nNinety-one percent of trial participants completed the questionnaire. Across all groups, the majority of women would participate in a study like this one again if given the opportunity. Main benefits of participating were as follows: benefits to one and one's babies, altruism, and receiving quality care. Randomization for the mode of delivery was challenging for women because of the desire to be involved in decision-making. Findings related to childbirth experience and the mode of delivery demonstrated a preference for vaginal birth across all groups. Those who had a vaginal birth were more satisfied with their birth experience.\nThis study provides evidence to inform practitioners about what women who have twin pregnancies like or dislike about birth and their desire for involvement in decision-making. Vaginal birth was preferred across all study groups and was associated with greater satisfaction with childbirth experience.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023ff","authors":["Murray\u2010Davis, Beth","McVittie, Jennifer","Barrett, Jon F.","Hutton, Eileen K."],"doi":"10.1111\/birt.12238","endpage":"292","first_seen_on":"2016-06-23T13:21:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1523-536X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Birth: Issues in Perinatal Care","last_mentioned_on":1468137886,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/birt.12238\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/birt.12238#.V2vwm_-z41I.twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/enhanced\/doi\/10.1111\/birt.12238?hootPostID=d37691639214aaeea6f8392808e99e5a"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/birt.12238\/pdf","pmid":"27321272","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"285","subjects":["obstetrics"],"title":"Exploring Women's Preferences for the Mode of Delivery in Twin Gestations: Results of the Twin Birth Study","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exploring-womens-preferences-mode-delivery-twin-gestations-results-twin-birth-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8058126,"mean":6.8389387129106,"rank":1467813,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6586419,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8058126,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263378,"mean":11.648772778185,"rank":62972,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":200151,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263378,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":548,"mean":9.0988811700183,"rank":173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":375,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":548,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":3.06,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
