Species exhibiting temperature-dependent sex determination are highly susceptible to such changes since the incubation environment influences critical offspring characteristics such as survival and sex ratio. Here we show that the mean incubation duration of loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) nests from a high-density nesting beach on Bald Head Island, North Carolina, USA has decreased significantly over the past 25\u00a0yr. This decrease in incubation duration is significantly positively correlated with mean air temperature and negatively correlated with mean precipitation during the nesting season. Additionally, although no change in hatching success was detected during this same period, a potentially detrimental consequence of shorter incubation durations is that they lead to the production of primarily female offspring. Given that global temperatures are predicted to increase by as much as 4\u00b0C over the next century, the mass feminization of sea turtle hatchlings is a high-priority concern. While presently limited in number, studies using long-term data sets to examine the temporal correlation between offspring characteristics and climatic trends are essential for understanding the scope and direction of climate change effects on species persistence.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002765","authors":["Reneker, J.L.","Kamel, S.J."],"doi":"10.1002\/ecy.1603","first_seen_on":"2016-10-02T03:05:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1939-9170","0012-9658"],"issue":"12","journal":"Ecology","last_mentioned_on":1475423569,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ecy.1603\/abstract;jsessionid=4827A26A1CB0CBA38015AB364CD744D3.f01t02"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ecy.1603\/pdf","pmid":"27912005","pubdate":"2016-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ecological Applications","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ecology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Climate Change Increases the Production of Female Hatchlings at a Northern Sea Turtle Rookery","type":"article","volume":"97","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/climate-change-increases-production-female-hatchlings-northern-sea-turtle-rookery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8461697,"mean":7.1088157534769,"rank":3380428,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":5053703,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8461697,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253911,"mean":12.807452703713,"rank":92872,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":159802,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253911,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3911,"mean":6.3393304347826,"rank":2512,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3911,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101,"mean":9.93448,"rank":61,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
