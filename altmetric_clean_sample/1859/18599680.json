These patients face disparities in both health and in health care, which can be effectively addressed by surgeons in collaboration with allied health professionals.\nWe reviewed the current state of surgical access and outcomes of underserved populations in American rural communities, American urban communities, and in low- and middle-income countries.\nWe searched PubMed using standardized search terms and reviewed the reference lists of highly relevant articles. We reviewed the reports of two recent global surgery commissions.\nThere is an opportunity for scholarship in rural surgery, urban surgery, and global surgery to be unified under the concept of SRS. The burden of surgical disease and the challenges to management demonstrate that achieving optimal health outcomes requires more than excellent perioperative care. Surgeons can and should regularly address the social determinants of health experienced by their patients. Formalized research and training opportunities are needed to meet the growing enthusiasm among surgeons and trainees to develop their practice as socially responsible surgeons.","altmetric_jid":"565496cd2a83ee7c2d8b458c","authors":["Robinson, Tyler D.","Oliveira, Thiago M.","Timmes, Theresa R.","Mills, Jacqueline M.","Starr, Nichole","Fleming, Matthew","Janeway, Megan","Haddad, Diane","Sidhwa, Feroze","Macht, Ryan D.","Kauffman, Douglas F.","Dechert, Tracey A."],"doi":"10.3389\/fsurg.2017.00011","first_seen_on":"2017-04-07T15:51:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2296-875X"],"journal":"Frontiers in Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1501789532,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fsurg.2017.00011\/full?utm_source=S-TWT&utm_medium=SNET&utm_campaign=ECO_FSURG_XXXXXXXX_auto-dlvrit"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fsurg.2017.00011\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC5380666","pmid":"28424776","pubdate":"2017-04-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Socially Responsible Surgery: Building Recognition and Coalition","type":"article","volume":"4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317445,"mean":7.0084957256017,"rank":3939025,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4193570,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317445,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248351,"mean":13.01869441514,"rank":117663,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":123397,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248351,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":224,"mean":1.367264573991,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":171,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":224,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":1.2529411764706,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CH":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/FrontSurgery\/statuses\/850375385925656576","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18599680],"posted_on":"2017-04-07T15:51:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Frontiers in Surgery","url":"http:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/Surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/533297738960478209\/lMu-V8Yw_normal.jpeg","description":"The official Twitter Feed for all the latest peer-reviewed articles appearing in the upcoming journal Frontiers in Surgery.","id_on_source":"FrontSurgery","tweeter_id":"2373752904","geo":{"lt":46.516,"ln":6.63282,"country":"CH"},"followers":134},"tweet_id":"850375385925656576"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/dkauffman2\/statuses\/893196153986088960","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18599680],"posted_on":"2017-08-03T19:45:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Doug Kauffman","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/694359611764269056\/F2Ovpe89_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"dkauffman2","tweeter_id":"34823560","geo":{"lt":42.35843,"ln":-71.05977,"country":"US"},"followers":54},"tweet_id":"893196153986088960"}]}}
