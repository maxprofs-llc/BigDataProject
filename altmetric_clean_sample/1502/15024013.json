All patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (code ICD-9CM 38.12) in Connecticut between October 1985 and September 1991 were retrospectively identified. A total of 3997 carotid endarterectomies were performed by 226 surgeons in four specialties: general, cardiac, vascular, and neurosurgery. Individual surgeon volume ranged from fewer than one per year to 27.5 per year (mean 2.9 carotid endarterectomies per year). Outcome was measured as a combined stroke and\/or death percentage. The average combined stroke and\/or death rate for the entire group was 4.9%. The combined stroke and\/or death percentage was influenced significantly by the surgeon's annual volume. Surgeons who performed one or fewer carotid endarterectomies (43% of total surgeons) were 2.5 times more likely (p < 0.002) to have a poor postoperative outcome than those who performed 10 or more per year (9.3% of total surgeons). Overall there was a statistically significant correlation between a surgeon's annual volume and outcome, particularly for general surgeons.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a37","authors":["Steven T.
