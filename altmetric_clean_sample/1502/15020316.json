The objectives of this study were to evaluate the feasibility of randomizing women with severe postpartum anaemia secondary to postpartum haemorrhage to RBC transfusion or intravenous iron, and to describe patient-reported outcomes, and haematological and iron parameters.\nWomen with a postpartum haemorrhage exceeding 1000 ml and an Hb between 5\u00b76 and 8\u00b71 g\/dl were randomized to 1500 mg of intravenous iron (n = 7) isomaltoside or RBC transfusion (n = 6). Participants completed the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and blood samples were drawn at inclusion, daily during the first week and at weeks 3, 8 and 12.\nWe screened 162 women and included 13 (8%). There was no significant difference between groups in fatigue or depression scores. RBC transfusion was associated with a higher Hb on day 1, inhibition of reticulocytosis during the first week and low iron levels. Intravenous iron was associated with increased reticulocytosis during the first week, repleted iron stores and a higher Hb in weeks 3-12.\nThis pilot study shows that intravenous iron could be an attractive alternative to RBC transfusion in severe postpartum anaemia, and that a larger trial is needed and feasible.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003711","authors":["Holm, C.","Thomsen, L.
