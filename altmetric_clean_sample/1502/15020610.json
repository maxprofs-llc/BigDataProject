Relative to undisturbed ecosystems, the cut ecosystem exhibited accelerated loss of nutrients: nitrogen lost during the first year after cutting was equivalent to the amount annually turned over in an undisturbed system, and losses of cations were 3 to 20 times greater than from comparable undisturbed systems. Possible causes of the pattern of nutrient loss from the cut ecosystem are discussed.","ads_id":"1968Sci...159..882B","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["F. H. Bormann","G. E.
