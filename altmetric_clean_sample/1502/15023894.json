The analysis suggests specific approaches for optimal decision making under uncertainty and specifying such decisions for subgroups based on the ratio of expected costs to expected benefits, and for valuing research using value of information calculations. Though ideal value of information calculations may be difficult, certain approaches with less stringent data requirements may bound the value of information. These approaches suggest methods by which the vast cost-effectiveness literature may help inform priorities for medical research.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dd1","authors":["Meltzer, D","David Meltzer"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0167-6296(00)00071-0","endpage":"129","first_seen_on":"2016-12-24T12:42:55+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0167-6296","01676296"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Health Economics","last_mentioned_on":1356998400,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0167-6296(00)00071-0"],"pmid":"11148867","pubdate":"2001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Economics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"109","subjects":["healthservices","hospitals"],"title":"Addressing uncertainty in medical cost\u2013effectiveness analysis","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0167629600000710","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/addressing-uncertainty-medical-costeffectiveness-analysis-implications-expected-utility-maximization"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8148913,"mean":6.8919768479455,"rank":679648,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7456836,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8148913,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262598,"mean":12.437005655053,"rank":34986,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":227397,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262598,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1099,"mean":10.031861566485,"rank":217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":867,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1099,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":14.133304347826,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
