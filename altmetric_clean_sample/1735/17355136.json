In this work, we report on two superstructures including a honeycomb-like lattice and identical nanocluster arrays formed by depositing Fe on Sb(111). Combined with first-principles calculations, both detailed atomic structures have been clarified. The honeycomb structure consists of a single layered Fe-Sb phase and the cluster phase is assigned as a (3\u00d73) Fe3Sb7 superlattice. Both structural phases exhibit high magnetic moments localized on d bands of Fe. Our results provide a method to fabricate novel 2D magnetic superstructures possessing great potentials in realization of Haldane model, spintronics applications and single atom catalysis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006816","authors":["Yinghui Yu","Huixia Fu","Limin She","Shuangzan Lu","Qinmin Guo","Hui Li","Sheng Meng","Gengyu Cao"],"doi":"10.1021\/acsnano.6b08347","first_seen_on":"2017-03-15T01:37:03+00:00","issns":["1936-0851","1936-086X"],"journal":"ACS Nano","last_mentioned_on":1489541808,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acsnano.6b08347"],"pmid":"28071896","pubdate":"2017-02-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Fe on Sb(111): Potential Two-Dimensional Ferromagnetic Superstructures","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acsnano.6b08347","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fe-sb111-potential-twodimensional-ferromagnetic-superstructures"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8360145,"mean":7.0505745135414,"rank":1222705,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":7061890,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8360145,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242963,"mean":13.638216461833,"rank":54651,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":185548,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242963,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5064,"mean":12.10559391665,"rank":1650,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":3333,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5064,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":31.943864864865,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
