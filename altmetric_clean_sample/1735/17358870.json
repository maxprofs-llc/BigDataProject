Patients' time includes time to admission, travel time, waiting time, and treatment time and can be substantial. Patients' time is, however, often ignored in economic analyses. This may lead to biased results and inappropriate policy recommendations, which may eventually influence patients' health, wellbeing and welfare. How to value patient time is not straightforward. Although there is some emerging literature on the monetary valuation of patient time, an important challenge remains to develop an approach that can be used to monetarily value time of patients not participating in the labour market. We aim to contribute to the health economics literature by describing and empirically illustrating how to monetarily value the time of patients not participating in the labour market comprehensively, using the contingent valuation method. It is worth noting that our method can also be applied to people participating in the labour market. This paper describes the development of the contingent valuation survey. We apply our survey approach to a sample of 238 Dutch patients not participating in the labour market: n\u00a0=\u00a0107 Radiotherapy department (data collected between November 2011 and January 2013); n\u00a0=\u00a044 Rehabilitation department (March 2012-May 2012); n\u00a0=\u00a087 Orthopaedics department (January to June 2013). Results show that those patients value waiting time the highest (\u20ac30.10 per hour) and value travel and treatment time equally with respectively \u20ac13.20 and \u20ac13.32 per hour. This paper encourages future empirical research refining and applying the developed survey methodology to create more data on how other subgroups of individuals value their patients' time.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6383cf058f610008969","authors":["Bernard van den Berg","Amiram Gafni","France Portrait"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.socscimed.2017.02.025","first_seen_on":"2017-03-15T05:17:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["02779536","1873-5347"],"journal":"Social Science & Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1489555043,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0277953617301144"],"pmid":"28288314","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Anthropology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Sociology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences"],"subjects":["healthservices","socialsciences"],"title":"Attributing a monetary value to patients' time: A contingent valuation approach","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0277953617301144","volume":"179","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/attributing-monetary-value-patients-time-contingent-valuation-approach"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8360145,"mean":7.0505745135414,"rank":7226906,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8360145,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242963,"mean":13.638253093076,"rank":202073,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242963,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6245,"mean":9.5842959641256,"rank":6107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6245,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146,"mean":18.215517241379,"rank":138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
