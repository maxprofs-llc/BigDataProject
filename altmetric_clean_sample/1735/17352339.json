Instead of the standard independent atom model (IAM) method, the X-ray scattering is calculated directly from ab initio wavefunctions. The role of molecular symmetry and Friedel's law is examined, with the molecules BF3, C5H5(-), NF3, and 1,3-cyclohexadiene used as specific examples. The contributions to the elastic X-ray scattering from the electronic, vibrational, and rotational portions of the molecular wavefunction are examined in CS2. In particular, it is observed that the rotational states give rise to distinct signatures in the scattering signal.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008ee3","authors":["Andr\u00e9s Moreno Carrascosa","Thomas Northey","Adam Kirrander"],"doi":"10.1039\/c6cp06793j","first_seen_on":"2017-03-14T22:21:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1463-9076","1463-9084"],"issue":"11","journal":"Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics (PCCP)","last_mentioned_on":1490032602,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2017\/CP\/C6CP06793J"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2017\/cp\/c6cp06793j","pmid":"28262866","pubdate":"2017-03-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"7853","subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"title":"Imaging rotations and vibrations in polyatomic molecules with X-ray scattering","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/xlink.rsc.org\/?DOI=C6CP06793J","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/imaging-rotations-vibrations-polyatomic-molecules-xray-scattering"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8389481,"mean":7.0670107241375,"rank":7251778,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8389481,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243580,"mean":13.646615011967,"rank":202942,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243580,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4290,"mean":2.0755089764514,"rank":2920,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4290,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":357,"mean":1.5897191011236,"rank":174,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":357,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
