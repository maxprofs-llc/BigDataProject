Chronic inflammation is a major etiological factor in HCC, so we investigated the role of cortisol in gender discrepancy in a zebrafish model of HCC. Inducible expression of oncogenic KrasV12 in hepatocytes of transgenic zebrafish resulted in accelerated liver tumor progression in males. These tumors were more heavily infiltrated with tumor-associated neutrophils (TAN) and macrophages (TAM) versus females, and they both showed pro-tumor gene expression and promoted tumor progression. Interestingly, the adrenal hormone cortisol was predominantly produced in males to induce Tgfb1 expression, which functioned as an attractant for TAN and TAM. Inhibition of cortisol signaling in males, or increase of cortisol level in females, decreased or increased the numbers of TAN and TAM, respectively, accompanied by corresponding changes in pro-tumor molecular expression. Higher levels of cortisol, TGFB1, and TAN\/TAM infiltration in males was also confirmed in human pre-HCC and HCC samples, features that positively correlated in human patients. These results identify increased cortisol production and TAN\/TAM infiltration as primary factors in the gender disparity of HCC development in both fish and human.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dd4","authors":["Chuan Yan","Qiqi Yang","Zhiyuan Gong"],"doi":"10.1158\/0008-5472.can-16-2200","first_seen_on":"2017-03-15T04:48:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0008-5472","1538-7445"],"journal":"Cancer Research","last_mentioned_on":1502103185,"links":["http:\/\/cancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/77\/6\/1395.short?rss=1&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/cancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/77\/6\/1395.short?rss=1","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1158\/0008-5472.CAN-16-2200"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/cancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/canres\/77\/6\/1395.full.pdf","pmid":"28202512","pubdate":"2017-03-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Association for Cancer Research","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Tumor-Associated Neutrophils and Macrophages Promote Gender Disparity in Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Zebrafish","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/cancerres.aacrjournals.org\/lookup\/doi\/10.1158\/0008-5472.CAN-16-2200","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tumorassociated-neutrophils-macrophages-promote-gender-disparity-hepatocellular-carcinoma-zebrafish"},"altmetric_score":{"score":17.5,"score_history":{"1y":17.5,"6m":17.5,"3m":14,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":17.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336644,"mean":7.0294968595789,"rank":496667,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7838463,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336644,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242556,"mean":13.624974121333,"rank":26503,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":215980,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242556,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7526,"mean":7.2469209302326,"rank":446,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7078,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7526,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150,"mean":7.5004429530201,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":138,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Ph.
