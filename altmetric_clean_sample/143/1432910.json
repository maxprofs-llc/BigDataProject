A retrospective analysis of a cohort of 9817 ACLRs recorded in an ACLR Registry was performed. Patients were included if they underwent primary ACLR with bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft, hamstring tendon autograft or allograft tissue. Aseptic failure was the main endpoint of the study. After adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, and body mass index, allografts had a 3.02 times (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.93 to 4.72) higher risk of aseptic revision than bone-patellar tendon-bone autografts (p < 0.001). Hamstring tendon autografts had a 1.82 times (95% CI 1.10 to 3.00) higher risk of revision compared with bone-patellar tendon-bone autografts (p = 0.019). For each year increase in age, the risk of revision decreased by 7% (95% CI 5 to 9). In gender-specific analyses a 2.26 times (95% CI 1.15 to 4.44) increased risk of hamstring tendon autograft revision in females was observed compared with bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft. We conclude that allograft tissue, hamstring tendon autografts, and younger age may all increase the risk of early revision surgery after ACLR.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f6100059fd","authors":["G.
