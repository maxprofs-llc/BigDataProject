NO\u2022 and its autoxidation products have an extensive biochemical reaction network that includes reactions with iron-sulfur clusters, DNA, and thiols. The fate of NO\u2022 inside a pathogen depends on a kinetic competition among its many targets, and is of critical importance to infection outcomes. Due to the complexity of the NO\u2022 biochemical network, where many intermediates are short-lived and at extremely low concentrations, several species can be measured, but stable products are non-unique, and damaged biomolecules are continually repaired or regenerated, kinetic models are required to understand and predict the outcome of NO\u2022 treatment. Here, we have constructed a comprehensive kinetic model that encompasses the broad reactivity of NO\u2022 in Escherichia coli. The incorporation of spontaneous and enzymatic reactions, as well as damage and repair of biomolecules, allowed for a detailed analysis of how NO\u2022 distributes in E. coli cultures. The model was informed with experimental measurements of NO\u2022 dynamics, and used to identify control parameters of the NO\u2022 distribution. Simulations predicted that NO\u2022 dioxygenase (Hmp) functions as a dominant NO\u2022 consumption pathway at O2 concentrations as low as 35 \u00b5M (microaerobic), and interestingly, loses utility as the NO\u2022 delivery rate increases. We confirmed these predictions experimentally by measuring NO\u2022 dynamics in wild-type and mutant cultures at different NO\u2022 delivery rates and O2 concentrations. These data suggest that the kinetics of NO\u2022 metabolism must be considered when assessing the importance of cellular components to NO\u2022 tolerance, and that models such as the one described here are necessary to rigorously investigate NO\u2022 stress in microbes. This model provides a platform to identify novel strategies to potentiate the effects of NO\u2022, and will serve as a template from which analogous models can be generated for other organisms.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003349","authors":["Jonathan L.
