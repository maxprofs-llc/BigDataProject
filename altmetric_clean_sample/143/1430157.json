We genotyped 31 top-ranked SNPs not previously associated with rheumatoid arthritis in an independent replication of 3,929 autoantibody-positive rheumatoid arthritis cases and 5,807 matched controls from eight separate collections. We identified a common variant at the CD40 gene locus (rs4810485, P = 0.0032 replication, P = 8.2 x 10(-9) overall, OR = 0.87). Along with other associations near TRAF1 (refs. 2,3) and TNFAIP3 (refs. 4,5), this implies a central role for the CD40 signaling pathway in rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis. We also identified association at the CCL21 gene locus (rs2812378, P = 0.00097 replication, P = 2.8 x 10(-7) overall), a gene involved in lymphocyte trafficking. Finally, we identified evidence of association at four additional gene loci: MMEL1-TNFRSF14 (rs3890745, P = 0.0035 replication, P = 1.1 x 10(-7) overall), CDK6 (rs42041, P = 0.010 replication, P = 4.0 x 10(-6) overall), PRKCQ (rs4750316, P = 0.0078 replication, P = 4.4 x 10(-6) overall), and KIF5A-PIP4K2C (rs1678542, P = 0.0026 replication, P = 8.8 x 10(-8) overall).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003164","authors":["Soumya Raychaudhuri","Elaine F Remmers","Annette T Lee","Rachel Hackett","Candace Guiducci","No\u00ebl P Burtt","Lauren Gianniny","Benjamin D Korman","Leonid Padyukov","Fina A S Kurreeman","Monica Chang","Joseph J Catanese","Bo Ding","Sandra Wong","Annette H M van der Helm-van Mil","Benjamin M Neale","Jonathan Coblyn","Jing Cui","Paul P Tak","Gert Jan Wolbink","J Bart A Crusius","Irene E van der Horst-Bruinsma","Lindsey A Criswell","Christopher I Amos","Michael F Seldin","Daniel L Kastner","Kristin G Ardlie","Lars Alfredsson","Karen H Costenbader","David Altshuler","Tom W J Huizinga","Nancy A Shadick","Michael E Weinblatt","Niek de Vries","Jane Worthington","Mark Seielstad","Rene E M Toes","Elizabeth W Karlson","Ann B Begovich","Lars Klareskog","Peter K Gregersen","Mark J Daly","Robert M Plenge","Raychaudhuri S","Remmers EF","Lee AT","Hackett R","Guiducci C","Burtt NP","Gianniny L","Korman BD","Padyukov L","Kurreeman FA","Chang M","Catanese JJ","Ding B","Wong S","van der Helm-van Mil AH","Neale BM","Coblyn J","Cui J","Tak PP","Wolbink GJ","Crusius JB","van der Horst-Bruinsma IE","Criswell LA","Amos CI","Seldin MF","Kastner DL","Ardlie KG","Alfredsson L","Costenbader KH","Altshuler D","Huizinga TW","Shadick NA","Weinblatt ME","de Vries N","Worthington J","Seielstad M","Toes RE","Karlson EW","Begovich AB","Klareskog L","Gregersen PK","Daly MJ","Plenge RM"],"doi":"10.1038\/ng.233","endpage":"1223","first_seen_on":"2013-05-03T02:21:55+00:00","issns":["1061-4036"],"issue":"10","journal":"Nature Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1258563650,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2757650\/?tool=pubmed"],"pmcid":"PMC2757650","pmid":"18794853","pubdate":"2008-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"NIH Public Access","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1216","subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Common variants at CD40 and other loci confer risk of rheumatoid arthritis","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/ng.233","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/common-variants-cd40-other-loci-confer-risk-rheumatoid-arthritis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4681163,"mean":5.6987966927893,"rank":490693,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":4160563,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4681163,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90416,"mean":7.2530543604491,"rank":11881,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":78233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90416,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3848,"mean":16.617573693787,"rank":1217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":2587,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3848,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":47.546266666667,"rank":57,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":16,"Researcher":49,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
