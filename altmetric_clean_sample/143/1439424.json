Therefore, development of a novel strategy for the treatment of bone cancer pain is needed for improvement of patient quality of life. This study examined whether selective spinal cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) activation alleviates bone cancer pain and also examined the spinal expression of CB1.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002255","doi":"10.1097\/aln.0b013e3181a51e0d","first_seen_on":"2013-05-05T11:05:02+00:00","issns":["0003-3022"],"issue":"1","journal":"Anesthesiology","last_mentioned_on":1413337652,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/anesthesiology\/Abstract\/2009\/07000\/Reduction_of_Bone_Cancer_Pain_by_Activation_of.31.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/anesthesiology\/Fulltext\/2009\/07000\/Reduction_of_Bone_Cancer_Pain_by_Activation_of.31.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/anesthesiology\/2009\/07000\/Reduction_of_Bone_Cancer_Pain_by_Activation_of.31.pdf","pmid":"19512863","pubdate":"2009-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"173","subjects":["anesthesiology"],"title":"Reduction of Bone Cancer Pain by Activation of Spinal Cannabinoid Receptor 1 and Its Expression in the Superficial Dorsal Horn of the Spinal Cord in a Murine Model of Bone Cancer Pain","type":"article","volume":"111","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reduction-bone-cancer-pain-activation-spinal-cannabinoid-receptor-1-expression-superficial-dorsal-ho-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.956,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.956},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4373405,"mean":4.8671827328057,"rank":613063,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":3760616,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4373405,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88078,"mean":6.6396287566561,"rank":15383,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":72695,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88078,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2399,"mean":3.0820333611343,"rank":240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":2159,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2399,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":3.7960317460317,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Other":3,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Neuroscience":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":2}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Cannabinoids \u2013 Are They a Pain?","url":"http:\/\/feedproxy.google.com\/~r\/DrugDiscoveryOpinion\/~3\/JsFMLFvkb3g\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[527728,1439424],"posted_on":"2009-08-19T07:30:21+00:00","summary":"Many groups developing cannabinoid receptor agonists for the treatment of pain have sought to identify selective CB2 receptor agonists to avoid the psychotropic effects associated with CB1 receptor agonists and a recent report in the journal Science may pr","author":{"name":"Drug Discovery Opinion","url":"http:\/\/drugdiscoveryopinion.com","description":"DDO Limited - Consultancy for Biotech and Pharma"}}],"facebook":[{"title":"Reduction of Bone Cancer Pain by Activation of Spinal Cannab... : Anesthesiology","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/100001325900682\/posts\/589795311074660","license":"public","citation_ids":[1439424],"posted_on":"2013-12-16T13:25:15+00:00","summary":"now comes real proof. they are called abstracts and get reviewed by scientific communities  .. \n\nhttp:\/\/journals.lww.com\/anesthesiology\/Fulltext\/2009\/07000\/Reduction_of_Bone_Cancer_Pain_by_Activation_of.31.aspx","author":{"name":"Douglas Tramill","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/100001325900682","facebook_wall_name":false,"image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/100001325900682\/picture","id_on_source":"100001325900682"}},{"title":"Reduction of Bone Cancer Pain by Activation of Spinal Cannab... : Anesthesiology","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/1142173666\/posts\/10203105234168712","license":"public","citation_ids":[1439424],"posted_on":"2014-10-15T01:47:32+00:00","summary":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/anesthesiology\/Fulltext\/2009\/07000\/Reduction_of_Bone_Cancer_Pain_by_Activation_of.31.aspx journals.lww.com","author":{"name":"Jere M Iah","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/1142173666","facebook_wall_name":false,"image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/1142173666\/picture","id_on_source":"1142173666"}}]}}
