The synaptogyrin family comprises three isoforms: two neuronal (synaptogyrin-1 and -3) and one ubiquitous (synaptogyrin-2) form. Although the expression patterns of the exocytic proteins synaptotagmin-1, SNAP-25, synaptobrevin-2 and synaptophysin have been elucidated in taste buds, the function and expression pattern of synaptogyrin-1 in rat gustatory tissues have not been determined. Therefore, we examined the expression patterns of synaptogyrin-1 and several cell-specific markers of type II and III cells in rat gustatory tissues. Reverse transcription\/polymerase chain reaction assays and immunoblot analysis revealed the expression of synaptogyrin-1 mRNA and its protein in circumvallate papillae. In fungiform, foliate and circumvallate papillae, the antibody against synaptogyrin-1 immunolabeled a subset of taste bud cells and intra- and subgemmal nerve processes. Double-labeling experiments revealed the expression of synaptogyrin-1 in most taste cells immunoreactive for aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase and the neural cell adhesion molecule. A subset of synaptogyrin-1-immunoreactive taste cells also expressed phospholipase C\u03b22, gustducin, or sweet taste receptor (T1R2). In addition, most synaptogyrin-1-immunoreactive taste cells expressed synaptobrevin-2. These results suggest that synaptogyrin-1 plays a regulatory role in transmission at the synapses of type III cells and is involved in exocytic function with synaptobrevin-2 in a subset of type II cells in rat taste buds.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c2","doi":"10.1007\/s00441-013-1629-3","first_seen_on":"2013-05-03T10:13:52+00:00","issns":["1432-0878"],"journal":"Cell & Tissue Research","last_mentioned_on":1367575877,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23636420?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23636420","pubdate":"2013-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Genetics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Molecular Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Proteomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["histology","cellbiology"],"title":"Expression of synaptogyrin-1 in T1R2-expressing type II taste cells and type III taste cells of rat circumvallate taste buds.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expression-synaptogyrin1-t1r2expressing-type-ii-taste-cells-type-iii-taste-cells-rat-circumvallate-t"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3074993,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":952969,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89203,"mean":7.014144929486,"rank":60389,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":18147,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89203,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":745,"mean":1.60575,"rank":394,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":189,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":745,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":1.3603888888889,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
