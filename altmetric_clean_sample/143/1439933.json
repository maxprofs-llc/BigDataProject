Using OCOC6F5 as a leaving group means that only 1 mol % of osmium is required and yields as high as 98% can be obtained. Acyclic homoallylic alcohols were substrates considered too unreactive for effective use in the tethered aminohydroxylation reaction; improved reaction conditions mean that they have now become viable substrates for oxidation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003265","authors":["Timothy J.
