However, these studies are complicated by the diverse methods used to culture, characterize, and deliver MSCs and by the variety of methods used to assess homing events. This review provides a critical analysis of the methods used to track homing of exogenously infused MSCs and discusses strategies for enhancing their trafficking to particular tissues.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e1f","authors":["Jeffrey M.
