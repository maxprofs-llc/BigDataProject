Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome is an allelic disorder characterised by macrocephaly, intestinal polyps, lipomas, and pigmented penile macules. Diagnostic criteria for CS are based on the presence of a range of clinical features. However, prior data on the component clinical features have been based primarily on compilations of cases reported before development of consensus diagnostic criteria.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6013cf058f6100062d0","authors":["Robert Pilarski","Julie A Stephens","Ryan Noss","James L Fisher","Thomas W Prior"],"doi":"10.1136\/jmg.2011.088807","first_seen_on":"2013-05-04T15:08:42+00:00","issns":["1468-6244"],"journal":"Journal of Medical Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1380431700,"links":["http:\/\/jmg.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2011\/06\/08\/jmg.2011.088807.abstract?papetoc","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21659347"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jmg.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2011\/06\/08\/jmg.2011.088807.full.pdf","pmid":"21659347","pubdate":"2011-06-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Predicting PTEN mutations: an evaluation of Cowden syndrome and Bannayan\u2013Riley\u2013Ruvalcaba syndrome clinical features","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/predicting-pten-mutations-evaluation-cowden-syndrome-bannayanrileyruvalcaba-syndrome-clinical-featur"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.024,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.024},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":481231,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":4555474,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93643,"mean":7.1766817667287,"rank":10962,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":82679,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93643,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1295,"mean":4.821741885626,"rank":108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":1182,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1295,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":8.2478709677419,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
