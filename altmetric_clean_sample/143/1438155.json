Current consensus statements provide clinicians with a common language for EFM as well as provide a basis for a simplified approach to interpretation and management. This article presents a summary of the content and implementation of a statewide initiative in interdisciplinary EFM education and training designed to give clinicians of all backgrounds a shared mental model in EFM. Challenges to implementation at individual institutions may include physician and nursing engagement as well as time and cost constraints.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a8a","doi":"10.1097\/jpn.0b013e31828ee7fe","first_seen_on":"2013-05-04T23:36:47+00:00","issns":["0893-2190"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1368178926,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jpnnjournal\/Abstract\/2013\/04000\/A_Collaborative_Interdisciplinary_Approach_to.8.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jpnnjournal\/2013\/04000\/A_Collaborative_Interdisciplinary_Approach_to.8.pdf","pmid":"23618933","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"126","subjects":["nursing","perinatology"],"title":"A Collaborative Interdisciplinary Approach to Electronic Fetal Monitoring: Report of a Statewide Initiative","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/collaborative-interdisciplinary-approach-electronic-fetal-monitoring"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2927984,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1432484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89294,"mean":7.0230248507723,"rank":57188,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":28814,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89294,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":326,"mean":1.0010769230769,"rank":135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":143,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":326,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JPNNonline\/statuses\/330827698198966272","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1438155],"posted_on":"2013-05-04T23:34:04+00:00","author":{"name":"JPNN","url":"http:\/\/www.jpnnjournal.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1202669791\/jpnn_normal.jpg","description":"The primary objective of The Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing is to provide practicing nurses with useful information on perinatal and neonatal nursing.","id_on_source":"JPNNonline","tweeter_id":"217113604","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":160},"tweet_id":"330827698198966272"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JPNNonline\/statuses\/332792652040916993","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1438155],"posted_on":"2013-05-10T09:42:05+00:00","author":{"name":"JPNN","url":"http:\/\/www.jpnnjournal.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1202669791\/jpnn_normal.jpg","description":"The primary objective of The Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing is to provide practicing nurses with useful information on perinatal and neonatal nursing.","id_on_source":"JPNNonline","tweeter_id":"217113604","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":160},"tweet_id":"332792652040916993"}],"facebook":[{"title":"A Collaborative Interdisciplinary Approach to Electronic Fet... : The Journal of Perinatal & Neonata","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=531630960229090&id=184150891643767","license":"public","citation_ids":[1438155],"posted_on":"2013-05-10T09:42:06+00:00","summary":"New Article:","author":{"name":"The Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/184150891643767","facebook_wall_name":"The Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/184150891643767\/picture","id_on_source":"184150891643767"}},{"title":"A Collaborative Interdisciplinary Approach to Electronic Fet... : The Journal of Perinatal & Neonata","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=529379053787614&id=184150891643767","license":"public","citation_ids":[1438155],"posted_on":"2013-05-04T23:34:11+00:00","summary":"Most Popular:","author":{"name":"The Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/184150891643767","facebook_wall_name":"The Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/184150891643767\/picture","id_on_source":"184150891643767"}}]}}
