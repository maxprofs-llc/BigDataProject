PLMVd has been shown to self-ligate in vitro primarily via the formation of 2',5'-phosphodiester bonds; however, in vivo the occurrence and necessity of this nonenzymatic mechanism are not evident. Here, we unequivocally report the presence of 2', 5'-phosphodiester bonds at the ligation site of circular PLMVd strands isolated from infected peach leaves. These bonds serve to close the linear conformers (i.e., intermediates), yielding circular ones. Furthermore, these bonds are shown to stabilize the replicational circular templates, resulting in a significant advantage in terms of viroid viability. Although the mechanism responsible for the formation of these 2',5'-phosphodiester bonds remains to be elucidated, a hypothesis describing in vivo nonenzymatic self-ligation is proposed. Most significantly, our results clearly show that 2',5'-phosphodiester bonds are still present in nature and that they are of biological importance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f92","authors":["Fabien C\u00f4t\u00e9","Dominique L\u00e9vesque","Jean-Pierre Perreault"],"doi":"10.1128\/jvi.75.1.19-25.2001","first_seen_on":"2013-05-04T02:28:44+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1098-5514","0022-538X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Virology","last_mentioned_on":1205994660,"links":["http:\/\/jvi.asm.org\/cgi\/content\/full\/jvi;75\/1\/19"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jvi.asm.org\/content\/75\/1\/19.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC113893","pmid":"11119569","pubdate":"2001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society for Microbiology","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Natural 2\u2032,5\u2032-Phosphodiester Bonds Found at the Ligation Sites of Peach Latent Mosaic Viroid","type":"article","volume":"75","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/natural-25phosphodiester-bonds-found-ligation-sites-peach-latent-mosaic-viroid"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.184,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.184},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685758,"mean":4.9469155541215,"rank":579930,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":3105404,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685758,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85631,"mean":6.7857171552026,"rank":16219,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":69411,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85631,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4423,"mean":3.0127340569878,"rank":450,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":3973,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4423,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":4.6194444444444,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
