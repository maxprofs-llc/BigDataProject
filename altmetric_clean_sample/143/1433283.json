Fibril formation of R3A\u03b22m was potently prevented by \u03b1B-crystallin. \u03b1B-crystallin also prevented the unfolding and nonfibrillar aggregation of R3A\u03b22m. From analysis of the NMR spectra collected at various R3A\u03b22m to \u03b1B-crystallin molar subunit ratios, it is concluded that the structured \u03b2-sheet core and the apical loops of R3A\u03b22m interact in a nonspecific manner with the \u03b1B-crystallin. Complementary information was derived from NMR diffusion coefficient measurements of wild-type \u03b22m at a 100-fold concentration excess with respect to \u03b1B-crystallin. Mass spectrometry acquired in the native state showed that the onset of wild-type \u03b22m oligomerization was effectively reduced by \u03b1B-crystallin. Furthermore, and most importantly, \u03b1B-crystallin reversibly dissociated \u03b22m oligomers formed spontaneously in aged samples. These results, coupled with our previous studies, highlight the potent effectiveness of \u03b1B-crystallin in preventing \u03b22m aggregation at the various stages of its aggregation pathway. Our findings are highly relevant to the emerging view that molecular chaperone action is intimately involved in the prevention of in vivo amyloid fibril formation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Gennaro Esposito","Megan Garvey","Vera Alverdi","Fabio Pettirossi","Alessandra Corazza","Federico Fogolari","Maurizio Polano","P.
