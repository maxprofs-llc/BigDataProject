However, the contribution that goal setting makes to the rehabilitation process is not yet established. Similarly, the specific form of goal setting that is most useful is still to be determined. The purpose of this review was to examine recent studies of goal setting and identify implications for clinical practice both early and late after brain injury.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005863","authors":["Evans JJ","Jonathan J.
