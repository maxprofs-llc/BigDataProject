A lengthy list of recommendations, reprinted in this article, was unanimously adopted by the conferees. Among the considerations addressed by the recommendations are a woman's right to exercise control over conditions of labor and delivery; the importance of communication between women, their families, and health personnel; and the need to make judicious use of technologies such as fetal monitoring. A network of evaluation groups to assess new technologies, sponsored by WHO and PAHO, is advocated.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008b2a","first_seen_on":"2013-05-04T12:26:33+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["0140-6736"],"issue":"8452","journal":"The Lancet","last_mentioned_on":1475249400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2863457"],"pmid":"2863457","pubdate":"1985-08-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Appropriate technology for birth.","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/appropriate-technology-birth"},"altmetric_score":{"score":21.776,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":21.776},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454083,"mean":7.1051250224367,"rank":414330,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":8039767,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454083,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121837,"mean":7.0162236120688,"rank":6728,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":115109,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121837,"percentile":94},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24606,"mean":27.913906929486,"rank":4859,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":19747,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24606,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":441,"mean":17.015118181818,"rank":94,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":347,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":441,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":12,"Researcher":24,"Student  > Ph.
