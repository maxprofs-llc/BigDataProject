Beyond these consolidated indications, BV has been tested in a number of different settings with promising results, leading for example to the recent approval as a consolidation after ASCT in high-risk HL patients.\nMain emerging areas of clinical investigation of BV include the use as a single-agent or in combination with bendamustine in first-salvage therapy of HL (bridge to ASCT), in the frontline setting in combination with AVD chemotherapy in HL and with CHP in ALCL, in relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphomas and finally in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) expressing CD30. Moreover, many new ADCs are currently under clinical evaluation, as for example the anti-CD79A polatuzumab vedotin in DLBCL. Expert commentary: In few years BV changed the therapeutic scenario of relapsed or refractory HL and ALCL and is rapidly moving toward first-line approval in combination with standard chemotherapy if ongoing randomized trials will demonstrate improved results. Combination strategies with bendamustine in first-salvage HL and with R-CHP in first-line DLBCL appear very promising.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073d2","authors":["Michele Merli"],"doi":"10.1080\/17474086.2016.1205949","endpage":"14","first_seen_on":"2016-07-15T20:30:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1747-4086","1747-4094"],"issue":"8","journal":"Expert Review of Hematology","last_mentioned_on":1468656871,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/17474086.2016.1205949?ai=1lfpu&mi=ianpxd&af=R"],"pmid":"27416486","pubdate":"2016-07-14T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"1","subjects":["hematology"],"title":"New uses for brentuximab vedotin and novel antibody drug conjugates in lymphoma","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-uses-brentuximab-vedotin-novel-antibody-drug-conjugates-lymphoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8078414,"mean":6.8578859978971,"rank":5848321,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1943132,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8078414,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259389,"mean":11.745926257189,"rank":167615,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":76528,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259389,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":353,"mean":1.4053295454545,"rank":152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":132,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":353,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":1.2053571428571,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
