It is, therefore, imperative for a radiologist to be familiar with the normal and abnormal imaging appearances of common breast implants. Diagnostic imaging studies such as mammography, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging are used to evaluate implant integrity, detect abnormalities of the implant and its surrounding capsule, and detect breast conditions unrelated to implants. Magnetic resonance imaging of silicone breast implants, with its high sensitivity and specificity for detecting implant rupture, is the most reliable modality to asses implant integrity. Whichever imaging modality is used, the overall aim of imaging breast implants is to provide the pertinent information about implant integrity, detect implant failures, and to detect breast conditions unrelated to the implants, such as cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5263cf058f610003d95","authors":["Shah, Amisha T","Jankharia, Bijal B"],"doi":"10.4103\/0971-3026.184409","first_seen_on":"2016-07-15T17:47:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0971-3026"],"issue":"2","journal":"Indian Journal of Radiology & Imaging","last_mentioned_on":1468604136,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27413269?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4931781","pmid":"27413269","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"216","title":"Imaging of common breast implants and implant-related complications: A pictorial essay","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/imaging-common-breast-implants-implantrelated-complications-pictorial-essay"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8076187,"mean":6.8570931149856,"rank":6991936,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8076187,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259360,"mean":11.74634960036,"rank":218378,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259360,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113,"mean":2.3043928571429,"rank":91,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/754006514226954240","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9731854],"posted_on":"2016-07-15T17:35:36+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":716},"tweet_id":"754006514226954240"}]}}
