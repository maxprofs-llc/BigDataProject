Data on the antifungal susceptibility as well as the molecular mechanism of triazole resistance in strains belonging to this section are scant. Forty-two black Aspergillus strains from human (16) and animal (14) patients and the environment (12) were molecularly characterized and their in vitro triazole susceptibility investigated. A. tubingensis was isolated from humans, animals and environmental settings, whereas A. awamori and A. niger exclusively from humans. Phylogenetic analyses of \u03b2-tubulin and calmodulin sequences were concordant in differentiating A. tubingensis from A. awamori and A. niger Voriconazole and posaconazole (PSZ) were the most active triazoles. One A. tubingensis strain was resistant to itraconazole and PSZ and one A. niger to PSZ. Sequence analysis of the cyp51A gene revealed different sequence types within a species, and A. tubingensis from A. awamori\/A. niger were phylogenetically distinct also according to the strain origin and susceptibility profile. Genetic analysis of the cyp51A sequences suggests that two non-synonymous mutations, resulting in amino acid substitutions in the CYP51A protein (L21R, Q228R) might be involved in azole resistance. Thought azole resistance in black Aspergillus isolates from animals and rural environments does not represent a threat to public health in Southern Italy, the use of triazoles in clinical setting needs to better monitored. The cyp51A sequence is useful for the molecular identification of black Aspergillus and point mutations in protein sequence could be responsible for azole resistance phenomena.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be9","authors":["Iatta, Roberta","Nuccio, Federica","Immediato, Davide","Mosca, Adriana","De Carlo, Carmela","Miragliotta, Giuseppe","Parisi, Antonio","Crescenzo, Giuseppe","Otranto, Domenico","Cafarchia, Claudia"],"doi":"10.1128\/jcm.01075-16","first_seen_on":"2016-07-15T19:28:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1098-660X","0095-1137"],"journal":"Journal of Clinical Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1468610889,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27413191?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27413191","pubdate":"2016-07-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"JCM.01075-16","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"\n              Species distribution and\n              in vitro\n              azole susceptibility of\n              Aspergillus\n              section\n              Nigri\n              from clinical and environmental settings\n            ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/species-distribution-vitro-azole-susceptibility-aspergillus-section-nigri-isolates-clinical-environm"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8076187,"mean":6.8570931149856,"rank":6991886,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8076187,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259359,"mean":11.746319512025,"rank":218349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259359,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4436,"mean":4.4802777903044,"rank":3949,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4436,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":87,"mean":15.658279069767,"rank":78,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":87,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/phy_papers\/statuses\/754034839800598530","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9733520],"posted_on":"2016-07-15T19:28:09+00:00","author":{"name":"phypapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/438115152294989824\/0M7ZG0xC_normal.jpeg","description":"Continuous feed for phylogenetics papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ PrePrints.
