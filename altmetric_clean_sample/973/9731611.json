In this review a clinical vignette to present a practical perspective on the contemporary management of acute type B dissection (ABAD) in a specialist vascular centre with particular focus on areas of debate is used.\nThis is a narrative clinical review.\nAggressive anti-impulse therapy is the cornerstone of management of all patients with ABAD. However, 20-30% of patients develop complicated ABAD defined by the presence of malperfusion syndromes, acute aortic dilatation, dissection extension, or persistent pain and hypotension. These complicated patients typically require intervention, and non-randomised series suggest TEVAR to be an effective alternative to open repair with a lower morbidity. There is considerable interest and controversy surrounding the use of TEVAR in uncomplicated ABAD patients for whom the intervention-free survival at 6 years is less than 50% for patients managed with anti-impulse therapy. Data regarding this question are sparse, but two randomised trials (ADSORB and INSTEAD) both demonstrated a higher rate of favourable aortic remodelling in patients managed with TEVAR than medical therapy alone. However, it is unclear whether this positive remodelling translates into a reduction in long-term mortality sufficient to balance the early perioperative hazards of endografting.\nDespite increasing adeptness at endovascular stenting, the long-term outcomes of patients with ABAD leave significant room for improvement. In particular, the optimum management of patients with uncomplicated disease is unclear and guidance from trials powered for long-term mortality is awaited. Until then, the principals of management of ABAD remain aggressive medical therapy for all patients, with TEVAR primarily reserved for those who develop complications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f610007376","authors":["Scott, A J","Bicknell, C D"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ejvs.2015.10.026","endpage":"459","first_seen_on":"2016-07-15T17:41:09+00:00","issns":["1532-2165","10785884"],"issue":"3","journal":"European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1468603666,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26684594?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26684594","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"452","subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Contemporary Management of Acute Type B Dissection","type":"article","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/contemporary-management-acute-type-b-dissection"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8076187,"mean":6.8570931149856,"rank":6991963,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8076187,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259360,"mean":11.746380831203,"rank":218387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259360,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":847,"mean":2.8681111111111,"rank":725,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":847,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":2.2782608695652,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
