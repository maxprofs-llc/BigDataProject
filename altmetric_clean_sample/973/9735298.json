We evaluated the causes, hearing, and speech performance before and after cochlear implant reimplantation in Mandarin-speaking users. Methods. In total, 589 patients who underwent cochlear implantation in our medical center between 1999 and 2014 were reviewed retrospectively. Data related to demographics, etiologies, implant-related information, complications, and hearing and speech performance were collected. Results. In total, 22 (3.74%) cases were found to have major complications. Infection (n = 12) and hard failure of the device (n = 8) were the most common major complications. Among them, 13 were reimplanted in our hospital. The mean scores of the Categorical Auditory Performance (CAP) and the Speech Intelligibility Rating (SIR) obtained before and after reimplantation were 5.5 versus 5.8 and 3.7 versus 4.3, respectively. The SIR score after reimplantation was significantly better than preoperation. Conclusions. Cochlear implantation is a safe procedure with low rates of postsurgical revisions and device failures. The Mandarin-speaking patients in this study who received reimplantation had restored auditory performance and speech intelligibility after surgery. Device soft failure was rare in our series, calling attention to Mandarin-speaking CI users requiring revision of their implants due to undesirable symptoms or decreasing performance of uncertain cause.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef852a83ee09648b548f","authors":["Hwang, Chung-Feng","Ko, Hui-Chen","Tsou, Yung-Ting","Chan, Kai-Chieh","Fang, Hsuan-Yeh","Wu, Che-Ming"],"doi":"10.1155\/2016\/8962180","endpage":"8","first_seen_on":"2016-07-15T21:58:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2314-6141","2314-6133"],"journal":"BioMed Research International","last_mentioned_on":1468619870,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27413753?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4927948","pmid":"27413753","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"1","title":"Comparisons of Auditory Performance and Speech Intelligibility after Cochlear Implant Reimplantation in Mandarin-Speaking Users","type":"article","volume":"2016","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparisons-auditory-performance-speech-intelligibility-after-cochlear-implant-reimplantation-mandar"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8076187,"mean":6.8570931149856,"rank":6991869,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8076187,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259360,"mean":11.746200964686,"rank":218337,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259360,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4289,"mean":3.0021483208955,"rank":3073,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4289,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":4.0336111111111,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
