To solve these problems, the use of mobile cloud computing assisted by cloud data centers has been proposed. However, cloud data centers are always very far from the mobile requesters. In this paper, we propose an improved multi-objective local mobile cloud model: Compounded Local Mobile Cloud Architecture with Dynamic Priority Queues (LMCpri). This new architecture could briefly store jobs that arrive simultaneously at the cloudlet in different priority positions according to the result of auction processing, and then execute partitioning tasks on capable helpers. In the Scheduling Module, NSGA-II is employed as the scheduling algorithm to shorten processing time and decrease requester cost relative to PSO and sequential scheduling. The simulation results show that the number of iteration times that is defined to 30 is the best choice of the system. In addition, comparing with LMCque, LMCpri is able to effectively accommodate a requester who would like his job to be executed in advance and shorten execution time. Finally, we make a comparing experiment between LMCpri and cloud assisting architecture, and the results reveal that LMCpri presents a better performance advantage than cloud assisting architecture.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Xiaohui Wei","Bingyi Sun","Jiaxu Cui","Gaochao Xu"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0158491","first_seen_on":"2016-07-15T17:51:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"7","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1468662853,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0158491","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0158491","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0158491"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0158491.PDF","pmcid":"PMC4946787","pmid":"27419854","pubdate":"2016-07-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0158491","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"A Multi-Objective Compounded Local Mobile Cloud Architecture Using Priority Queues to Process Multiple Jobs","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multiobjective-compounded-local-mobile-cloud-architecture-using-priority-queues-process-multiple-job"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8078414,"mean":6.8578859978971,"rank":767592,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7303465,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8078414,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259389,"mean":11.745857634123,"rank":36332,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":222657,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259389,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112451,"mean":10.56086500667,"rank":16621,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":95654,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112451,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4444,"mean":10.57667116813,"rank":656,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":3771,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4444,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
