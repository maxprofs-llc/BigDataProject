Six male 16-week-old OLETF rats were divided into three groups: a DJB group, a sham operation group, and a daily injection with a GLP-1 receptor agonist (liraglutide) group. The gut microbiota of the three groups was analyzed at postoperative week 8 using the PCR-clone library method targeting the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. The DJB group showed a decrease in Bacteroidia in comparison to the other two groups (DJB, 3.9\u00a0%\/2.8\u00a0%; sham, 10.8\u00a0%\/11.6\u00a0%; liraglutide, 33.2\u00a0%\/14.1\u00a0%). In addition, DJB markedly increased the ratio of Gammaproteobacteria (DJB, 10.8\u00a0%\/13.7\u00a0%; sham, 0.2\u00a0%\/1.2\u00a0%; liraglutide, 0\u00a0%\/0.1\u00a0%). DJB changes the composition of gut microbiota; these changes might be the factors that contribute to the effects of DJB.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037d2","authors":["Kashihara, Hideya","Shimada, Mitsuo","Yoshikawa, Kozo","Higashijima, Jun","Nakao, Toshihiro","Nishi, Masaaki","Takasu, Chie","Hideya Kashihara","Mitsuo Shimada","Kozo Yoshikawa","Jun Higashijima","Toshihiro Nakao","Masaaki Nishi","Chie Takasu"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00595-016-1373-x","first_seen_on":"2016-07-15T17:54:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1436-2813","0941-1291"],"journal":"Surgery Today","last_mentioned_on":1480096569,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27412617?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27412617","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00595-016-1373-x"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00595-016-1373-x.pdf","pmid":"27412617","pubdate":"2016-07-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Japan","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgical Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Duodenal-jejunal bypass changes the composition of the gut microbiota","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/duodenaljejunal-bypass-changes-composition-gut-microbiota"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7747098,"mean":6.6307251234818,"rank":4022801,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2175890,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7747098,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257122,"mean":11.612773472411,"rank":140898,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":89961,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257122,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":551,"mean":1.3053636363636,"rank":113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":392,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":551,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.96666666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
