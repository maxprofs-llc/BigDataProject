Insights from past and current natural history studies have provided the framework for a compelling strategy for primary and secondary prevention. Primary prevention of T1D should target the general childhood population with vaccines (viral or tolerogenic) or by altering microbiota-induced immunoregulation. Secondary prevention will likely require combination therapies (anti-inflammatories, immunomodulatory agents, beta cell survival agents, and\/or agents improving glucose control) used sequentially or simultaneously to preserve residual beta cell function and prevent symptomatic disease. Critical gaps and challenges for prevention of T1D include an incomplete understanding of disease pathogenesis and heterogeneity, the lack of cost-effective risk screening and validated biomarkers for precise staging of disease and optimizing design of shorter and smaller prevention clinical trials, and the lack of appreciation of the impact and burden of T1D and the potential for its prevention. A comprehensive and concerted effort of funders, academia, industry, regulatory authorities, payers, government bodies, health care providers, and the T1D community will be required to deliver on JDRF's vision and strategy for prevention of T1D.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032ad","authors":["Insel, Richard","Dunne, Jessica L"],"doi":"10.1111\/pedi.12326","endpage":"92","first_seen_on":"2016-07-15T17:53:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1399-5448"],"journal":"Pediatric Diabetes","last_mentioned_on":1468604843,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27411442?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27411442","pubdate":"2016-07-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"87","subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"JDRF's vision and strategy for prevention of type 1 diabetes","type":"article","volume":"17 Suppl 22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/jdrfs-vision-strategy-prevention-type-1-diabetes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8076187,"mean":6.8570931149856,"rank":6991924,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8076187,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259359,"mean":11.746377732709,"rank":218372,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259359,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":366,"mean":2.9741260273973,"rank":319,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":366,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":2.6021428571429,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Student  > Ph.
