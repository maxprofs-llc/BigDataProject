In this study, cytokine-related mechanisms that may lead to the defect of Treg were investigated in patients with anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody positive MG (AChR+MG). Proliferation and cytokine production of responder T (Tresp) cells in response to polyclonal activation were measured in a suppression assay. The effect of IL-21 on suppression was evaluated in vitro in co-culture. IL-21 increased the proliferation of Tresp cells in Tresp\/Treg co-cultures. Tresp cells from patients with MG secreted significantly lower levels of IL-2. In patients with MG, IL-2 levels did not change with the addition of Treg to cultures, whereas it decreased significantly in controls. In Tresp\/Treg co-cultures, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 production increased in the presence of Treg in patients. IFN-\u03b3 was decreased, whereas IL-17A was increased in both patient and control groups. IL-21 inhibited the secretion of IL-4 in MG and healthy controls (HC), and IL-17A in HC only. The results demonstrated that IL-21 enhances the proliferation of Tresp cells in the presence of Treg. An effect of IL-21 mainly on Tresp cells through IL-2 is implicated. This article is protected by copyright.
