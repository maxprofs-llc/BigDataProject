Sleep was staged by means of EEG, EOG and EMG, and swallowing was monitored by means of an external sensing device attached to the neck. It was found that during sleep, swallowing is episodic, with long swallow-free periods. Swallows occur almost exculusively in association with movement arousals which are most frequent during Stages REM, 1 and 2 of sleep.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6163cf058f610007206","authors":["Lichter, I","Muir, R C"],"first_seen_on":"2017-07-04T13:16:00+00:00","issns":["0013-4694"],"issue":"4","journal":"Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology","last_mentioned_on":1499174145,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/46823\/"],"pmid":"46823","pubdate":"1975-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["physiology","neurology"],"title":"The pattern of swallowing during sleep.","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pattern-swallowing-during-sleep"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8461697,"mean":7.1088157534769,"rank":4522978,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2357379,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8461697,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236013,"mean":12.962475340237,"rank":132129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":81747,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236013,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":255,"mean":4.458157480315,"rank":212,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":255,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
