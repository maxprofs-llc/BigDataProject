Hyperlactatemia was defined as a blood lactate concentration \u22655mmol\/L and high-grade hyperlactatemia a lactate level \u226510mmol\/L. Lactate clearance was calculated as the percentage of decrease in lactate concentration from the peak value.\nOf 10,123 patients, 1373 (13.6%) had lactate concentration \u22655mmol\/L, and 434(31.6%) of them had \u226510mmol\/L. The most common causes of hyperlactatemia were sepsis\/septic shock and post-cardiac surgery. An association was found between lactate concentration and in-hospital mortality (p<0.001). The area under the receiver-operating-characteristics (ROC) of lactate concentration and the optimal cut off to predict mortality were 0.72 (0.70-0.75) and 8.6mmol\/L, respectively. ROC analysis for lactate clearance to predict in-hospital survival showed that the best area under the curve was obtained at 12h: 0.67 (95% confidence interval 0.59-0.75).\nHyperlactatemia was common and associated with a high mortality in critically ill patients. Lactate clearance had limited utility for predicting in-hospital survival.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a20","authors":["Ferreruela, Mireia","Raurich, Joan Maria","Ayestar\u00e1n, Ignacio","Llompart-Pou, Juan Antonio","Mireia Ferreruela","Joan Maria Raurich","Ignacio Ayestar\u00e1n","Juan Antonio Llompart-Pou"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jcrc.2017.07.039","first_seen_on":"2017-07-30T06:27:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0883-9441","08839441","1557-8615"],"journal":"Journal of Critical Care","last_mentioned_on":1505705400,"links":["https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jcrc.2017.07.039","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28772222\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28772222"],"pmid":"28772222","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["criticalcare"],"title":"Hyperlactatemia in ICU patients: Incidence, causes and associated mortality","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hyperlactatemia-icu-patients-incidence-causes-associated-mortality"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.93,"score_history":{"1y":8.93,"6m":8.93,"3m":8.93,"1m":5.08,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.93},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8430317,"mean":7.0913096536278,"rank":1034354,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7395543,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8430317,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":222613,"mean":12.792670413095,"rank":39204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":183371,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":222613,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1096,"mean":4.3647744292237,"rank":132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":964,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1096,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":4.4184090909091,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
