PDAC produces significant inflammatory response with resultant lymphopenia and thrombocytosis. The prognostic role of platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) as a tumor marker has been defined. We aimed to find the role of PLR as a diagnostic marker for PDAC in differentiating benign head mass comparing with carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9).\nA prospective study of patients with biopsy-proven PDAC and benign IHM with underlying chronic pancreatitis from 1st November 2014 to 30th June 2016 was performed. Total blood count including platelet count and CA 19-9 were recorded and statistically analyzed.\nThere was no significant difference in total leukocyte counts (7789\u00b12027 vs. 7568\u00b11289\u00a0cells\/mm(3)) between PDAC (n\u00a0=\u00a034) and IHM (n\u00a0=\u00a027). However, the mean lymphocyte (2235\u00b1837 vs. 2701\u00b1631\u00a0cells\/mm(3)) and platelet counts in mm(3) (3.36\u00b10.789)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(5) vs. (2.45\u00b10.598)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(5) showed difference. The median PLR was 161.9 (IQR\u00a0=\u00a0117.5-205.6) in PDAC and 91 (IQR\u00a0=\u00a077.2-106.6) in IHM. The median CA 19-9 (U\/mL) in PDAC and IHM was 69.3 (IQR\u00a0=\u00a022.7-427.7) and 13.9 (IQR\u00a0=\u00a07.2-23.6), respectively. On plotting the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve), area under the curve was maximum for PLR (88.7%) compared to CA 19-9 (77.8%) in diagnosing PDAC (p<0.0001). Using coordinates of ROC, PLR cutoff value was 113.5 (sensitivity-79.4%, specificity-92.6%, positive predictive value (PPV)-91.5%, negative predictive value (NPV)-99.7%) while CA 19-9 cutoff value was 25.3\u00a0U\/mL (sensitivity-73.5%, specificity-77.8%, PPV-78.5%, NPV-74.6%).\nPLR may be useful to differentiate PDAC from benign IHM in patients with chronic pancreatitis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f61000774f","authors":["Shanavas Kakkat","Ramesh Rajan","R.
