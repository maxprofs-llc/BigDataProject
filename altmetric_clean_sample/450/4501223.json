He reported having had several tick bites in months before the reaction. The serum specific IgE showed strong positivity to alpha-gal. This is clearly alpha-gal anaphylaxis with delayed onset after meat ingestion caused by tick bite, confirmed by alpha-gal IgE positivity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9273cf058f61000dd1a","authors":["Calamari, A M","Poppa, M","Villalta, D","Pravettoni, V"],"first_seen_on":"2015-09-12T16:20:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1764-1489"],"issue":"5","journal":"European annals of allergy and clinical immunology","last_mentioned_on":1442451799,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26357002"],"pmid":"26357002","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Alpha-gal anaphylaxis: the first case report in Italy.","type":"article","volume":"47","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alphagal-anaphylaxis-first-case-report-italy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6354076,"mean":5.8388740315468,"rank":2602151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3608691,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6354076,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195310,"mean":9.7521451955619,"rank":87261,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":101482,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195310,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126,"mean":1.86368,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":88,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
