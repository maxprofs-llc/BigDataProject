Reversing the neuronal hyperexcitability induced by nerve damage is a logical treatment strategy but has proven frustratingly difficult. Here, we propose a novel explanation for that difficulty. Changes in several different ion channels are individually sufficient to cause hyperexcitability in primary somatosensory neurons. Despite offering multiple drug targets, this scenario is problematic: if multiple sufficient changes are triggered by nerve injury, then no single change is necessary for hyperexcitability. This so-called degeneracy compromises therapeutic interventions because drug effects on any one ion channel can be circumvented by changes occurring in other ion channels. Overcoming degeneracy demands a more integrative approach to drug discovery.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a6","authors":["Ratt\u00e9, St\u00e9phanie","Prescott, Steven A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.conb.2015.08.007","first_seen_on":"2015-09-14T11:23:21+00:00","funders":["niehs","cihr"],"issns":["1873-6882","09594388"],"journal":"Current Opinion in Neurobiology","last_mentioned_on":1454258133,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26363576?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0959438815001348"],"pmid":"26363576","pubdate":"2015-09-14T22:00:19+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["biology","neurology"],"title":"Afferent hyperexcitability in neuropathic pain and the inconvenient truth about its degeneracy ","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/afferent-hyperexcitability-neuropathic-pain-inconvenient-truth-about-degeneracy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7066845,"mean":6.2846355963116,"rank":1537374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":5500051,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7066845,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227118,"mean":9.1013651113744,"rank":60159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":166058,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227118,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":930,"mean":4.4046609257266,"rank":275,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":645,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":930,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":5.3076923076923,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
