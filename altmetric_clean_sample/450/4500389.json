Promising species for this purpose are the evergreen shrubs of the genus Atriplex. The objective of the research was to study the growing responses of Atriplex halimus under different thermal regimes and to evaluate the biomass accumulation of selected clones. The test was carried out in four sites of Sardinia Island (Italy) characterized by different latitude, altitude and air temperature trends along the year. In every site, potted plants of five clones of A. halimus were compared for biomass production as measured by linear growth of plants (central axis and secondary shoots), as well as by dry weight of leaves, shoots and roots per plant. Correlations between sums of hour-degrees under or above the thresholds of critical air temperatures, comprised between 0 and 35\u00a0\u00b0C, and the plant growth indicators were analysed. Differences among the five clones, with regard to the influence of low temperatures on plant growth and on the biomass production were evaluated. Among five tested clones, GIO1 and SAN3 resulted more sensitive to low temperatures. Clones MAR1, PAL1 and FAN3 resulted less sensitive to low temperatures and in the site characterized by the lowest minimum temperatures also have shown greater adaptability and thus biomass growth in the observed period. The clone PAL1 showed a lower shoot\/root biomass ratio as adaptation to cold temperature, and the clone FAN3, the opposite behaviour and a general preference to temperate thermal regimes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b28","authors":["Dessena, Leonarda","Mulas, Maurizio"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00484-015-1062-2","first_seen_on":"2015-09-12T10:52:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-1254"],"journal":"International Journal of Biometeorology","last_mentioned_on":1442055125,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26353974?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26353974","pubdate":"2015-09-12T22:02:51+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Atmospheric Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Animal Physiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biophysics and Biological Physics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Meteorology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Physiology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Earth and Planetary Sciences","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biophysics"],"title":"Influence of temperature on biomass production of clones of Atriplex halimus.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-temperature-biomass-production-clones-atriplex-halimus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6326302,"mean":5.8274056156985,"rank":5388544,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6326302,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194836,"mean":9.7516989965868,"rank":155848,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194836,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":366,"mean":4.8219835616438,"rank":319,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":366,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":5.7303636363636,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
