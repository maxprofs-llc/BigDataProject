Here, we examined whether deregulation of \u03b2-catenin signaling is related to the aggressive characteristics of certain types of breast cancers. Analysis of cytokine levels in MDA-MB-231 cells overexpressing a constitutively active form of \u03b2-catenin (CA\u03b2-catenin) revealed a higher level of CCL5 expression. Cells transfected with CA\u03b2-catenin or stimulated with recombinant CCL5 exhibited increased cell invasion activity and spheroid formation in vitro. Furthermore, CA\u03b2-catenin-transfected MDA-MB-231 cells formed larger tumor masses that contained more Ki-67-positive cells and infiltrating lymphocytes than did the control cells. An inhibitor of CCR5 and a pan-CXCR neutralizing antibody dramatically reduced CA\u03b2-catenin-promoted activities. In addition to CCL5, 6-BIO, a chemical activator of \u03b2-catenin, induced cell invasion and spheroid formation in MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, high levels of nuclear \u03b2-catenin accumulation were detected in breast cancer in patients with metastasis but not in those without metastasis. Nuclear \u03b2-catenin localization is related to increased CCL5 production in breast cancer. These findings suggest that \u03b2-catenin expression enhances tumor progression via chemokine production in breast cancers and that \u03b2-catenin signaling is a critical regulator of the aggressive traits of breast cancers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002890","authors":["Yasuhara, Rika","Iri\u00e9, Tarou","Suzuki, Kenya","Sawada, Terumasa","Miwa, Noriko","Sasaki, Akiko","Tsunoda, Yuko","Nakamura, Seigo","Mishima, Kenji"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.yexcr.2015.09.003","first_seen_on":"2015-09-13T10:10:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1090-2422","00144827"],"journal":"Experimental Cell Research","last_mentioned_on":1451486586,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26363360?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0014482715300860"],"pmid":"26363360","pubdate":"2015-09-13T22:00:08+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"The \u03b2-catenin signaling pathway induces aggressive potential in breast cancer by up-regulating the chemokine CCL5 ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/%CE%B2catenin-signaling-pathway-induces-aggressive-potential-breast-cancer-upregulating-chemokine-ccl5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6892495,"mean":6.1874169550219,"rank":4892169,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1753917,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6892495,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":225969,"mean":9.0267885895349,"rank":139213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":71931,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":225969,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1254,"mean":2.2833487629689,"rank":854,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":356,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1254,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":3.2967777777778,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
