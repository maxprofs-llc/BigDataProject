The phytochemical resveratrol found in wine, derived from grapes, has been thought to be responsible for cardiovascular benefits associated with wine consumption because it was shown to have antioxidant and antiplatelet activities. In the present investigation, we examined the effect of resveratrol on induction of tissue factor (TF) expression in vascular cells that were exposed to pathophysiological stimuli. The data presented herein show that resveratrol, in a dose-dependent manner, inhibited the expression of TF in endothelial cells stimulated with a variety of agonists, including interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). A similar inhibition of TF induction was also seen in LPS stimulated monocytes that were pretreated with resveratrol before their stimulation with LPS. In addition, resveratrol was shown to inhibit the LPS-induced expression of TNFalpha mRNA in endothelial cells and of TNFalpha and IL-1beta mRNA in monocytes. Nuclear run-on analysis in endothelial cells showed that resveratrol inhibited TF expression at the level of transcription. However, resveratrol did not significantly alter the binding of the transcription factors c-Fos\/c-Jun and c-Rel\/p65, the transcription factors required for the induction of TF promoter in both endothelial cells and monocytes. Similarly, resveratrol had no significant effect on the binding of NF-kappaB in endothelial cells stimulated with IL-1beta, TNFalpha, and LPS. Overall, our data show that resveratrol could effectively suppress the aberrant expression of TF and cytokines in vascular cells, but it requires further investigation to understand how resveratrol exerts its inhibitory effect.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006b29","authors":["Usha R.
