Reported data suggest that cross-reacting mechanisms might play an important role in a significant proportion of allergic sensitizations to furry animals (common pets and unusual \/ exotic mammals) especially in the absence of any possible direct \/ indirect contact. In this context an evaluation of specific IgE by using the micro-array technique ImmunoCAP ISAC (Thermofisher Scientific - Immuno-Diagnostics, Sweden) for lipocalins (Can f 1, Can f 2, Equ c 1, Fel d 4, Mus m 1) and albumins (Bos d 6, Can f 3, Equ c 3, Fel d 2) might be very useful to evaluate the possibility of cross-reactions between the allergens of different animals. In fact, allergic sensitization without animal exposure is a relevant risk for patients, because they are not aware about the possibility that even severe respiratory symptoms may develop after an occasional animal contact. This aspect should be taken into account by susceptible individuals before acquiring new pets, after removal of common pets or beginning a contact for working \/ leisure activity with a common as well as uncommon animal.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9273cf058f61000dd1a","authors":["Liccardi, Gennaro","Bil\u00f2, M B","Manzi, F","Piccolo, A","Di Maro, E","Salzillo, A"],"first_seen_on":"2015-09-12T10:27:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1764-1489"],"issue":"5","journal":"European annals of allergy and clinical immunology","last_mentioned_on":1442107423,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26357003?dopt=Abstract&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26357003?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26357003","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"What could be the role of molecular-based allergy diagnostics in detecting the risk of developing allergic sensitization to furry animals?","type":"article","volume":"47"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6330141,"mean":5.8293205110783,"rank":2592286,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3595539,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6330141,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194892,"mean":9.7533795506206,"rank":87091,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":101251,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194892,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126,"mean":1.85968,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":89,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Feed_Fido\/statuses\/642645624584736768","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4500200],"posted_on":"2015-09-12T10:27:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Feed Fido","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/531619313619193858\/3GUEOdk8_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"Feed_Fido","tweeter_id":"2869861967","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":3},"tweet_id":"642645624584736768"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ConcordeMedica\/statuses\/642767764323729409","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4500200],"posted_on":"2015-09-12T18:32:31+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr Alex Concorde","url":"http:\/\/www.dralexconcorde.info\/#!health-and-medicine\/c224f","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1248165228\/concorde_medica_cropped__normal.jpg","description":"Dr Alex is creator of a unique 21C Individual Medicine called 'CruX'!
