Here, we determined the complete genomic sequence of the As. bogorensis type strain NBRC 16594, and conducted comparative analyses of gene expression under different conditions of co-culture with mammalian cells and standard AAB culture. The genome of As. bogorensis contained 2,758 protein-coding genes within a circular chromosome of 3,198,265 bp. There were two complete operons encoding cytochrome bo3-type ubiquinol terminal oxidases: cyoABCD-1 and cyoABCD-2. The cyoABCD-1 operon was phylogenetically common to AAB genomes, whereas the cyoABCD-2 operon belonged to a lineage distinctive from the cyoABCD-1 operon. Interestingly, cyoABCD-1 was less expressed under co-culture conditions than under the AAB culture conditions, whereas the converse was true for cyoABCD-2. Asaia bogorensis shared pathogenesis-related genes with another pathogenic AAB, Granulibacter bethesdensis, including a gene coding pathogen-specific large bacterial adhesin and additional genes for the inhibition of oxidation and antibiotic resistance. Expression alteration of the respiratory chain and unique hypothetical genes may be key traits that enable the bacterium to survive under the co-culture conditions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007156","authors":["Kawai, Mikihiko","Higashiura, Norie","Hayasaki, Kimie","Okamoto, Naruhei","Takami, Akiko","Hirakawa, Hideki","Matsushita, Kazunobu","Azuma, Yoshinao"],"doi":"10.1093\/dnares\/dsv018","first_seen_on":"2015-09-12T10:35:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1756-1663"],"journal":"DNA Research","last_mentioned_on":1442780740,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26358298?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26358298","http:\/\/dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/09\/09\/dnares.dsv018.long"],"pmid":"26358298","pubdate":"2015-09-12T22:01:15+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","genetics"],"title":"Complete genome and gene expression analyses of Asaia bogorensis reveal unique responses to culture with mammalian cells as a potential opportunistic human pathogen","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/complete-genome-gene-expression-analyses-asaia-bogorensis-reveal-unique-responses-culture-mammalian"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6368969,"mean":5.8427884125037,"rank":1419783,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":4934042,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6368969,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195834,"mean":9.739441238198,"rank":59287,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":135627,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195834,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":296,"mean":4.0587661016949,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":230,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":296,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":9.3946,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
