Under such a scenario, mRNAs that lack these specialized signals would be shunted into a default pathway where they are retained in the nucleus and eventually degraded. These ideas were based on the selective use of model mRNA reporters. For example, it has been shown that splicing promotes the nuclear export of certain model mRNAs, such as human \u03b2-globin, and that in the absence of splicing, the cDNA-derived mRNA is retained in the nucleus and degraded. Here we provide evidence that \u03b2-globin mRNA contains an element that actively retains it in the nucleus and degrades it. Interestingly, this nuclear retention activity can be overcome by increasing the length of the mRNA or by splicing. Our results suggest that contrary to many current models, the default pathway for most intronless RNAs is to be exported from the nucleus, unless the RNA contains elements that actively promote its nuclear retention.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f610008844","authors":["Abdalla Akef","Eliza S.
