A wide range (70 to 90\u00b0C) has been used. This study aimed to compare outcomes with two set temperatures for the lumbar facet medial branch ablation, 90 and 80\u00b0C.\nThis retrospective study compared the degree of patient self-reported functional improvement relief, postoperative opioid dose changes, as well as duration among lumbar facet medial branch (RFA) patients who had the procedures performed at 80 or 90\u00b0C.\nPatients who underwent the procedure at 90\u00b0C had 3.1 (95% CI 1.7, 6.5) times the odds (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0004) of reporting functional improvement of at least 50% when compared to those who underwent neurotomy at 80\u00b0C. For self-reported functional improvement greater or equal to 75%, the results were sustained with an odds ratio of 2.8 (95% CI 1.2, 5.7) favoring those with 90\u00b0C temperature neurotomy (P\u00a0=\u00a00.002).\nThere seems to be significant functional improvement associated with temp of 90\u00b0C compared to 80\u00b0C, with no added risk of complications. Randomized controlled studies are warranted.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003283","authors":["Costandi, Shrif","Garcia-Jacques, Mauricio","Dews, Teresa","Kot, Michael","Wong, Kevin","Azer, Gerges","Atalla, Jasmyn","Looka, Michael","Nasr, Elie","Mekhail, Nagy","Garcia\u2010Jacques, Mauricio"],"doi":"10.1111\/papr.12346","endpage":"n\/a","first_seen_on":"2015-09-15T06:51:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1533-2500"],"journal":"Pain Practice","last_mentioned_on":1442427904,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/papr.12346","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26369502?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/papr.12346\/pdf","pmid":"26369502","pubdate":"2015-09-16T18:25:18+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"n\/a","subjects":["psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"Optimal Temperature for Radiofrequency Ablation of Lumbar Medial Branches for Treatment of Facet-Mediated Back Pain.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/optimal-temperature-radiofrequency-ablation-lumbar-medial-branches-treatment-facetmediated-back-pain"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6484819,"mean":5.9644006576586,"rank":4550694,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1697409,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6484819,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":199261,"mean":9.7341577737629,"rank":126884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":62700,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":199261,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":464,"mean":4.4102807775378,"rank":302,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":140,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":464,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":4.8240740740741,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Other":3,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":2,"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Neuroscience":1,"Psychology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/643678275043135489","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4509258],"posted_on":"2015-09-15T06:50:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":982},"tweet_id":"643678275043135489"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/howtobeatpain\/statuses\/644215439568957440","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4509258],"posted_on":"2015-09-16T18:25:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Tom","url":"http:\/\/q.gs\/1nLP7","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2580122876\/Untitled_normal.png","description":"Ways to beat pain","id_on_source":"howtobeatpain","tweeter_id":"805076989","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":640},"tweet_id":"644215439568957440"}]}}
