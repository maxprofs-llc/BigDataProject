Among those that managed WSH comprehensively, workers were 4.4 times (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.33 to 8.25) more likely to be proud to work for their company, 7.4 times (95% CI, 3.96 to 13.90) more likely to be satisfied with their current job, and 1.7 times (95% CI, 1.21 to 2.32) more likely to balance the demands of work and home.\nThere is a need to enhance awareness and education on comprehensive and integrated WSH in Singapore companies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e91","authors":["Chia, Sin Eng","Wah, Lim John","Khim, Judy Sng Gek","Yoong, Joanne","Lim, Raymond Boon Tar","Seng, Chia Kee"],"doi":"10.1097\/jom.0000000000000502","first_seen_on":"2015-09-13T14:37:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1536-5948","1076-2752"],"issue":"9","journal":"Journal of Occupational & Environmental Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1442155013,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/joem\/Abstract\/2015\/09000\/A_Study_on_the_Comprehensive_and_Integrated.5.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/joem\/2015\/09000\/A_Study_on_the_Comprehensive_and_Integrated.5.pdf","pmid":"26340284","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"958","subjects":["environmentalhealth","occupationalmedicine"],"title":"A Study on the Comprehensive and Integrated Workplace Safety and Health Services in Singapore","type":"article","volume":"57","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/study-comprehensive-integrated-workplace-safety-health-services-singapore-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6334804,"mean":5.8312220102194,"rank":5395517,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6334804,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195335,"mean":9.7740703205791,"rank":156188,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195335,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1735,"mean":5.0396412918108,"rank":1458,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1735,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":9.0347368421053,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
