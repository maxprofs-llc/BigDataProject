When measuring global transcript levels only, the effect of the perturbation (e.g. transcription factor overexpression or drug treatment) on its target genes is often obscured by delayed feedback and secondary effects until the changes are fully propagated. As a proof of principle, we show that selective measuring of transcripts which are only synthesized after a perturbation (4sU-seq) is a more sensitive method to identify targets and time-dependent transcriptional responses than global transcript profiling. By metabolically labelling RNA in a time-course setup we could vastly increase the sensitivity of MYCN target gene detection compared to traditional RNA-sequencing. The validity of targets identified by 4sU-seq was demonstrated using ChIP-seq and neuroblastoma microarray tumour data. Here we describe the methodology, both molecular biology and computational aspects, required to successfully apply this 4sU-seq approach.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e5c","authors":["Schwarzl, Thomas","Higgins, Desmond G","Kolch, Walter","Duffy, David J","Thomas Schwarzl","Desmond G.
