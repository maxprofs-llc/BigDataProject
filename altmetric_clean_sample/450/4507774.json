These findings may indicate an accommodation period is necessary to acclimate to SB sitting.\nFor this study, 6 males and 6 females completed two separate, 2-hr sitting sessions on an SB. Half the participants completed a 9-day accommodation period between the visits, whereas the other half did not use an SB during the time. On both occasions, self-reported perceived discomfort ratings were collected along with erector spinae and abdominal muscle activity and lumbar spinal postures.\nDiscomfort ratings were reduced in female participants following the accommodation; no effects on muscle activation or lumbar spine postures were observed.\nAccommodation training may reduce perceived low-back discomfort in females.Trunk muscle activity and lumbar spine postures during seated office work on an SB did not differ between groups; however, greater sample power was required to conclusively address these variables.\nRegarding whether to use an SB in place of a standard office chair, this study indicates that females electing to use an SB can decrease discomfort by following an accommodation protocol; no evidence was found to indicate that SB chair use will improve trunk strength or posture, even following an accommodation period.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4dd3cf058f610001c0b","authors":["Jennie A.
