A lactulose breath test for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth has been used to select patients who will respond. However, its predictive value, using the classic definition of a positive lactulose breath test, has been disappointing.\nWe conducted a retrospective evaluation to study characteristics of the lactulose breath test that may be predictive of a response to antibiotics in patients with the irritable bowel syndrome.\nA clinical practice database was interrogated for consecutive patients who had a lactulose breath test for irritable bowel syndrome symptoms and a subsequent antibiotic course. Hydrogen\u00a0+\u00a0methane levels with carbon dioxide correction were plotted against time. Various profiles of the breath test curves were catalogued and compared with respect to their predictive value for symptom response to antibiotics.\nLactulose breath test graphs of 561 patients of all irritable bowel syndrome subtypes were grouped into categories based on their hydrogen\u00a0+\u00a0methane levels with respect to time. Of subjects whose hydrogen\u00a0+\u00a0methane rise was <20\u00a0ppm throughout the test (group 1; N\u00a0=\u00a095), 94.7\u00a0% improved after antibiotics (95\u00a0% CI 90.1-99.3). Of those with a rise <20\u00a0ppm within the first 90\u00a0min but a rise >50\u00a0ppm thereafter (group 3; N\u00a0=\u00a053), 47.2\u00a0% improved (95\u00a0% CI 33.7-60.6). The difference between groups 1 and 3 was statistically significant P\u00a0<\u00a00.001.\nA lactulose breath test appears to be useful in predicting response to antibiotics in patients with the irritable bowel syndrome. A hydrogen\u00a0+\u00a0methane rise <20\u00a0ppm throughout the duration of the test is most predictive. This observation contradicts the classic definition of a positive lactulose breath test.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002709","authors":["Kasir, Rafid","Zakko, Salam","Zakko, Philip","Adler, Michael","Lee, Aaron","Dhingra, Sachin","Guttermuth, Cecile","Rafid Kasir","Salam Zakko","Philip Zakko","Michael Adler","Aaron Lee","Sachin Dhingra","Cecile Guttermuth"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10620-015-3872-9","first_seen_on":"2015-09-14T18:36:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-2568","0163-2116"],"issue":"3","journal":"Digestive Diseases & Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1467117462,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26362282","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s10620-015-3872-9","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26362282?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26362282","pubdate":"2015-09-14T22:00:48+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Hepatology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Transplant Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Predicting a Response to Antibiotics in Patients with the Irritable Bowel Syndrome.","type":"article","volume":"61","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/predicting-response-antibiotics-patients-irritable-bowel-syndrome-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7958342,"mean":6.7226589717569,"rank":5748681,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1925192,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7958342,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231271,"mean":9.2438055606001,"rank":144516,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":71687,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231271,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1578,"mean":3.489296131896,"rank":994,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":542,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1578,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":13.405957446809,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"reddit":[{"title":"Predicting a Response to Antibiotics in Patients with the Irritable Bowel Syndrome. - PubMed","url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ibs\/comments\/3kv051\/predicting_a_response_to_antibiotics_in_patients\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[4507360],"posted_on":"2015-09-14T02:41:15+00:00","author":{"name":"testingTestingIBS","url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ibs","id_on_source":"ibs","followers":447,"subreddit":"ibs: it's a pain"}}],"facebook":[{"title":"Predicting a Response to Antibiotics in Patients with the Irritable Bowel Syndrome. - PubMed - NCBI","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=608603899287614&id=267003663447641","license":"public","citation_ids":[4507360,4507360],"posted_on":"2016-05-28T13:43:01+00:00","summary":"Predicting a Response to Antibiotics in Patients with the Irritable Bowel Syndrome.","author":{"name":"SIBO Symposium","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/267003663447641","facebook_wall_name":"SIBO Symposium","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/267003663447641\/picture","id_on_source":"267003663447641"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MicrobiomePaper\/statuses\/747770346556657665","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4507360],"posted_on":"2016-06-28T12:35:18+00:00","author":{"name":"Microbiome Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/585212126173732865\/jEvg1KpB_normal.jpg","description":"The latest PubMed publications on Microbiome Research delivered direct to your Twitter Feed.
