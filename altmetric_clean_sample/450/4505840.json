The activation of NF\u03baB is strictly regulated by several posttranslational modifications including phosphorylation, neddylation and ubiquitination. Several types of ubiquitination play important roles in multi-step regulations of the NF\u03baB pathway. Some of the tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) proteins functioning as E3 ubiquitin ligases are known to regulate various biological processes such as inflammatory signaling pathways. One of the TRIM family proteins, TRIM39, for which the gene has single nucleotide polymorphisms, has been identified as one of the genetic factors in Behcet's disease. However, the role of TRIM39 in inflammatory signaling had not been fully elucidated. In this study, to elucidate the function of TRIM39 in inflammatory signaling, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening using TRIM39 as a bait and identified Cactin, which has been reported to inhibit NF\u03baB- and TLR-mediated transcriptions. We show that TRIM39 stabilizes Cactin protein and that Cactin is upregulated after TNF\u03b1 stimulation. TRIM39 knockdown also causes activation of the NF\u03baB signal. These findings suggest that TRIM39 negatively regulates the NF\u03baB signal in collaboration with Cactin induced by inflammatory stimulants such as TNF\u03b1.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c7","authors":["Suzuki, Masanobu","Watanabe, Masashi","Nakamaru, Yuji","Takagi, Dai","Takahashi, Hidehisa","Fukuda, Satoshi","Hatakeyama, Shigetsugu"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00018-015-2040-x","first_seen_on":"2015-09-14T10:57:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1420-9071","1420-682X"],"issue":"5","journal":"Cellular & Molecular Life Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1466911688,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26363554?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26363554","pubdate":"2015-09-14T22:00:19+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"TRIM39 negatively regulates the NF\u03baB-mediated signaling pathway through stabilization of Cactin.","type":"article","volume":"73","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/trim39-negatively-regulates-nfbmediated-signaling-pathway-through-stabilization-cactin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7947684,"mean":6.7156263575118,"rank":5741533,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1922243,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7947684,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231225,"mean":9.2429186935612,"rank":144485,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":71689,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231225,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1538,"mean":3.0960091086532,"rank":1094,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":389,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1538,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":1.7990384615385,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
