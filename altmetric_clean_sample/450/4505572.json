Forty-one participants listened to a soundtrack depicting traumatic scenes (e.g., police brutality, torture and rape). Immediately after listening to the soundtrack, the subjects completed a randomly assigned task for 10\u00a0min. Intrusions from the soundtrack were reported in a diary during the following seven-day period.\nIn line with a modality-specific approach to intrusion modulation, auditory intrusions were reduced by verbal tasks compared to both a no-task and a visuospatial interference task..\nThe study did not control for individual differences in imagery ability which may be a feature in intrusion development.\nThe results provide an increased understanding of how intrusive mental images can be modulated which may have implications for preventive treatment..","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cbd","authors":["Tabrizi, Fara","Jansson, Billy"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jbtep.2015.09.003","first_seen_on":"2015-09-14T09:37:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00057916","1873-7943"],"journal":"Journal of Behavior Therapy & Experimental Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1442223447,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0005791615300239"],"pmid":"26422002","pubdate":"2015-10-01T22:00:25+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences","psychiatry"],"title":"Reducing Involuntary Memory by Interfering Consolidation of Stressful Auditory Information: A pilot study ","type":"article","volume":"50","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reducing-involuntary-memory-interfering-consolidation-stressful-auditory-information-pilot-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6338000,"mean":5.8315711024889,"rank":5398418,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6338000,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195531,"mean":9.8210785045773,"rank":156321,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195531,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":510,"mean":4.6014263261297,"rank":417,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":510,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":3.8194444444444,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
