In this paper, a comprehensive study on contemporary portable wind energy harvesters has been conducted. The electrical power generation methods of portable wind energy harvesters are surveyed in three major groups, piezoelectric-, electromagnetic-, and electrostatic-based generators. The paper also takes another view of this area by gauging the required mechanisms for trapping wind flow from ambient environment. In this regard, rotational and aeroelastic mechanisms are analyzed for the portable wind energy harvesting devices. The comparison between both mechanisms shows that the aeroelastic mechanism has promising potential in producing an energy harvester in smaller scale although how to maintain the resonator perpendicular to wind flow for collecting the maximum vibration is still a major challenge to overcome for this mechanism. Furthermore, this paper categorizes the previously published portable wind energy harvesters to macro and micro scales in terms of their physical dimensions. The power management systems are also surveyed to explore the possibility of improving energy conversion efficiency. Finally some insights and research trends are pointed out based on an overall analysis of the previously published works along the historical timeline.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5333cf058f6100045ba","authors":["Seyedfakhreddin Nabavi","Lihong Zhang"],"doi":"10.3390\/s16071101","first_seen_on":"2016-07-17T09:05:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1424-8220"],"issue":"7","journal":"Sensors (14248220)","last_mentioned_on":1495473191,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/16\/7\/1101","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4970146\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/16\/7\/1101\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4970146","pmid":"27438834","pubdate":"2016-07-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Portable Wind Energy Harvesters for Low-Power Applications: A Survey","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/portable-wind-energy-harvesters-lowpower-applications-survey"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8250529,"mean":6.9707556030289,"rank":3568966,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4564111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8250529,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237258,"mean":12.347210644996,"rank":96404,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":136531,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237258,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3399,"mean":1.968030606239,"rank":583,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":2760,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3399,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174,"mean":1.4934450867052,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":145,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
