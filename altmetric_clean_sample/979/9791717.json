However, the function of miR-214 in the development and treatment of breast cancer remains elusive. In this study, we report that miR-214 is strikingly down-regulated in breast cancer cell lines and clinical samples, particularly, in the doxorubicin resistant tumor tissues. Remarkably, restoration of miR-214 expression induces apoptosis and sensitizes the MCF7 cells sustaining wild-type p53, but not the p53 null MDA-MB-157\u00a0cells, to doxorubicin. Furthermore, we reveal that miR-214 directly down-regulates the expression of RFWD2, also known as COP1, an E3 ligase targeting the tumor suppressor p53 for proteasomal degradation. In addition, RFWD2 protein levels are reversely correlated with miR-214 expression levels in breast cancer tissues. Moreover, ectopic expression of RFWD2 markedly abolishes miR-214-triggered apoptosis of MCF7 cells. In conclusion, miR-214 functions as a tumor suppressor by regulating the RFWD2-p53 cascade, thus delivery of miR-214 analogs could be a potential adjunct therapy in breast cancer harboring wild type p53.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","authors":["Zhang, Jiaxuan","Su, Beibei","Gong, Chen","Xi, Qingsongg","Chao, Tengfei","Jiaxuan Zhang","Beibei Su","Chen Gong","Qingsongg Xi","Tengfei Chao"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbrc.2016.07.054","first_seen_on":"2016-07-17T10:24:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1090-2104","0006291X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1495724346,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27422604?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27422604?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27422604","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"miR-214 promotes apoptosis and sensitizes breast cancer cells to doxorubicin by targeting the RFWD2-p53 cascade","type":"article","volume":"478","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mir214-promotes-apoptosis-sensitizes-breast-cancer-cells-doxorubicin-targeting-rfwd2p53-cascade"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8266357,"mean":6.977935429341,"rank":3908359,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4174208,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8266357,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237367,"mean":12.347493735413,"rank":109885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":119943,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237367,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8754,"mean":2.7424195133097,"rank":5422,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":3209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8754,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":142,"mean":2.4262127659574,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":99,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":142,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
