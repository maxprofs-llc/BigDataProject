In different studies, the pathophysiology connection of QC to various diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD) was described. Algae are known for the ability to synthesize complex and highly-diverse compounds with specific enzyme inhibition properties. Therefore, we screened different algae species for the presence of QC inhibiting metabolites using a new \"Reverse Metabolomics\" technique including an Activity-correlation Analysis (AcorA), which is based on the correlation of bioactivities to mass spectral data with the aid of mathematic informatics deconvolution. Thus, three QC inhibiting compounds from microalgae belonging to the family of sulfolipids were identified. The compounds showed a QC inhibition of 81% and 76% at concentrations of 0.25 mg\/mL and 0.025 mg\/mL, respectively. Thus, for the first time, sulfolipids are identified as QC inhibiting compounds and possess substructures with the required pharmacophore qualities. They represent a new lead structure for QC inhibitors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f61000668a","authors":["Stephanie Hielscher-Michael"],"doi":"10.3390\/md14110203","first_seen_on":"2016-11-02T10:48:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1660-3397"],"issue":"11","journal":"Marine Drugs","last_mentioned_on":1480707338,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-3397\/14\/11\/203?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-3397\/14\/11\/203"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-3397\/14\/11\/203\/pdf","pmid":"27827845","pubdate":"2016-11-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"203","subjects":["biology","pharmacology"],"title":"Natural Products from Microalgae with Potential against Alzheimer\u2019s Disease: Sulfolipids Are Potent Glutaminyl Cyclase Inhibitors","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/natural-products-microalgae-potential-against-alzheimers-disease-sulfolipids-potent-glutaminyl-cycla"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.1,"score_history":{"1y":3.1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7836572,"mean":6.6415682037409,"rank":1899880,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":5918274,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7836572,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235952,"mean":12.836775237231,"rank":79892,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":155173,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235952,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":992,"mean":3.4745489404642,"rank":230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":760,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":992,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":3.4283870967742,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":44,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
