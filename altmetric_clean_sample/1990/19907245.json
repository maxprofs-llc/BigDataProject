The feasibility and the validity of newly proposed method are affirmed in the analytical monomer spectra. To go beyond the independent local bath approximation, all the correlations of site energy fluctuations and excitonic coupling fluctuations are included in our strategy, and their influence on the absorption and CD spectra is investigated based on the Frenkel exciton model of homodimer. In the end, a good fit of the absorption and part of CD spectra for the entire B800-B850 ring in the light-harvesting complexes 2 of purple bacteria to the experimental data is given, and the simulation results suggest that the asymmetry in the 800 nm region of CD spectra is actually an indication of B800-B850 inter-ring coupling.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cee","authors":["Yaling Ke","Yi Zhao"],"doi":"10.1063\/1.4982230","first_seen_on":"2017-05-06T23:57:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0021-9606","1089-7690"],"issue":"17","journal":"Journal of Chemical Physics","last_mentioned_on":1494115509,"links":["http:\/\/aip.scitation.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1063\/1.4982230?mi=3togxg&af=R&ConceptID=37&target=topic"],"pmid":"28477611","pubdate":"2017-05-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"AIP Publishing LLC","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"title":"Hierarchy of stochastic Schr\u00f6dinger equation towards the calculation of absorption and circular dichroism spectra","type":"article","volume":"146","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hierarchy-stochastic-schr%C3%B6dinger-equation-towards-calculation-absorption-circular-dichroism-spectra"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8170298,"mean":6.9145785001388,"rank":5913855,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1965625,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8170298,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237165,"mean":12.523690509521,"rank":154051,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":69319,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237165,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5599,"mean":2.7022418720972,"rank":2693,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":2586,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5599,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231,"mean":4.221347826087,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":149,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
