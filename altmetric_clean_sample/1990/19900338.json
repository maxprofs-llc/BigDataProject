Group 1 infants were discharged home on apnea monitors (AM) (n = 28), and Group 2 infants were not on apnea monitors (nonAM)(n = 46). Measured by the Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue (MAF) scale, mean fatigue scores from Time 1 to Time 3 markedly increased for the monitor group and decreased for the nonmonitor group. The scores were significantly different between the two groups at Times 2 and 3 but not at baseline. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures showed group by time interaction effects on fatigue. Monitoring and alleviation of fatigue in home caregivers of preterm infants on apnea monitors are necessary.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005732","authors":["Williams, P D","Press, A","Williams, A R","Piamjariyakul, U","Keeter, L M","Schultz, J","Hunter, K"],"first_seen_on":"2017-05-06T11:40:19+00:00","issns":["0897-1897"],"issue":"2","journal":"Applied Nursing Research","last_mentioned_on":1494882169,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10319521"],"pmid":"10319521","pubdate":"1999-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing"],"title":"Fatigue in mothers of infants discharged to the home on apnea monitors.","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fatigue-mothers-infants-discharged-home-apnea-monitors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":44,"score_history":{"1y":44,"6m":44,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":44},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8208063,"mean":6.9506291146371,"rank":204739,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":8003066,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8208063,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238938,"mean":12.544684222201,"rank":12711,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":226214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238938,"percentile":94},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":219,"mean":3.1171376146789,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":216,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":219,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.2583333333333,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
