The association between lipid markers (total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglycerides), APOE genotype, and cognitive decline in HIV infection was examined using mixed-effects models.\n\u2003The median baseline age of participants was 51, 81% were white, and 89% had education >12 years. HIV+ men had similar baseline total cholesterol and LDL, but lower HDL and higher triglycerides than controls (P<0.001). Higher cholesterol and LDL were associated with faster rates of cognitive decline (P<0.01), while higher HDL attenuated decline (P=0.02) in HIV+ men. In HIV+ men with elevated cholesterol, statin use was associated with a slower estimated rate of decline (P=0.02). APOE \u03f54 genotype accelerated cognitive decline in HIV+ but not HIV- men (P=0.01), with trajectories diverging from HIV- \u03f54 carriers after age 50. Cholesterol levels did not modify the association of \u03f54 genotype with decline (P=0.9).\n\u2003Elevated cholesterol and APOE \u03f54 genotype are independent risk factors for cognitive decline in ART-adherent HIV+ men over age 50. Treatment of dyslipidemia may be an effective strategy to reduce cognitive decline in older HIV+ individuals.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000255e","authors":["Shibani S. Mukerji","Joseph J.
