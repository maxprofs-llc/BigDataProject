As a result, it has become increasingly apparent that there is a substantial degree of mechanistic variation between ABC transporters that function as importers, which correlates with their physiological roles. Here, we summarize recent advances in ABC importers structure-function studies and provide an explanation as to the origin of the different mechanisms of action.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e5c","authors":["Oded Lewinson","Nurit Livnat-Levanon"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jmb.2017.01.010","first_seen_on":"2017-07-26T23:56:19+00:00","issns":["00222836"],"journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1501086505,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0022283617300384"],"pmid":"28104364","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Mechanism of Action of ABC Importers: Conservation, Divergence, and Physiological Adaptations","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mechanism-action-abc-importers-conservation-divergence-physiological-adaptations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8449581,"mean":7.1026410460558,"rank":6411165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1148918,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8449581,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":226509,"mean":12.906015972946,"rank":161848,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":40263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":226509,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4008,"mean":3.2035787372099,"rank":3492,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":254,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4008,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":2.1363636363636,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
