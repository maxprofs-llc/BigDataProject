One hundred seven patients were enrolled. Overall, 27 (26%) patients responded with a complete remission (CR) rate of 21% and CR without platelet recovery (CRp) of 5%. The overall 4-week mortality rate was 9%. In conclusion, BIDFA is active and safe in heavily pretreated patients with myeloid malignancies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000580a","authors":["Jabbour E","Garcia-Manero G","Cortes J","Ravandi F","Plunkett W","Gandhi V","Faderl S","O'Brien S","Borthakur G","Kadia T","Burger J","Konopleva M","Brandt M","Huang X","Kantarjian H","Elias Jabbour","Guillermo Garcia-Manero","Jorge Cortes","Farhad Ravandi","William Plunkett","Varsha Gandhi","Stefan Faderl","Susan O'Brien","Gautam Borthakur","Tapan Kadia","Jan Burger","Marina Konopleva","Mark Brandt","Xuelin Huang","Hagop Kantarjian"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.clml.2012.03.003","endpage":"251","first_seen_on":"2012-08-11T11:47:58+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["2152-2650","21522650"],"issue":"4","journal":"Clinical Lymphoma, Myeloma & Leukemia","last_mentioned_on":1344692694,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S2152265012000511"],"pmid":"22534616","pubdate":"2012-04-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"244","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Twice-Daily Fludarabine and Cytarabine Combination With or Without Gentuzumab Ozogamicin is Effective in Patients With Relapsed\/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia, High-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome, and Blast- Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia ","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S2152265012000511","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/twicedaily-fludarabine-cytarabine-combination-without-gentuzumab-ozogamicin-effective-patients-relap"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5028713,"mean":5.9653160399705,"rank":3324707,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1495801,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5028713,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79179,"mean":5.7008287403066,"rank":48477,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":27132,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79179,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266,"mean":2.1033660377358,"rank":154,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":101,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1.35,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
