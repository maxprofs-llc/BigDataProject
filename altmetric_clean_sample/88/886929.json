With the formalization of prenatal care in the early 1900s, maternal bed rest became a standard of care, especially toward the end of pregnancy. Antepartum bed rest is a common obstetric management tool, with up to 95% of obstetricians utilizing maternal activity restriction in some way in their practice. Bed rest is prescribed for a variety of complications of pregnancy, from threatened abortion and multiple gestations to preeclampsia and preterm labor. Although the use of bed rest is pervasive, there is a paucity of data to support its use. Additionally, many well-documented adverse physical, psychological, familial, societal, and financial effects have been discussed in the literature. There have been no complications of pregnancy for which the literature consistently demonstrates a benefit to antepartum bed rest. Given the well-documented adverse effects of bed rest, disruption of social relationships, and financial implications of this intervention, there is a real need for scientific investigation to establish whether this is an appropriate therapeutic modality. Well-designed randomized, controlled trials of bed rest versus normal activity for various complications of pregnancy are required to lay this debate to rest once and for all.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5083cf058f610003129","authors":["Bigelow, Catherine","Stone, Joanne"],"doi":"10.1002\/msj.20243","endpage":"302","first_seen_on":"2012-08-14T12:50:35+00:00","issns":["1931-7581","0027-2507"],"issue":"2","journal":"Mount Sinai Journal of Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1344948335,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/msj.20243\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/msj.20243\/pdf","pmid":"21425272","pubdate":"1994-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"291","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Bed Rest in Pregnancy","type":"article","volume":"78","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bed-rest-pregnancy-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8429296,"mean":7.090036166243,"rank":6081564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2335842,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8429296,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98334,"mean":6.1305712222754,"rank":61957,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":36160,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98334,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155,"mean":4.3247272727273,"rank":131,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":3.9808571428571,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
