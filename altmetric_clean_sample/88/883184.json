Patients and family members who had a critical care experience were approached for participation. An adapted version of the Schmidt Perception of Nursing Care Survey was administered. The Schmidt Perception of Nursing Care Survey factors--seeing the individual patient, explaining, responding, and watching over-were analyzed for 637 participants (263 before and 374 after the tele-ICU implementation). Analysis of data from patients and family members indicated significantly higher means for the following factors: seeing the individual patient (P =.004), responding (P =.002), and watching over (P =.006) only when there was an awareness by the patient and family members that the care team was at the bedside and at the tele-ICU command center. The perceptions of care in these cases may suggest an improved patient experience when a tele-ICU is part of the care team.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005d57","doi":"10.1097\/nci.0b013e31825ed8bb","first_seen_on":"2012-08-11T11:51:19+00:00","issns":["1559-7768"],"issue":"3","journal":"AACN Advanced Critical Care","last_mentioned_on":1350509808,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/aacnadvancedcriticalcare\/Abstract\/2012\/07000\/Perceptions_of_the_Care_Experience_in_Critical.12.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/aacnadvancedcriticalcare\/2012\/07000\/Perceptions_of_the_Care_Experience_in_Critical.12.pdf","pmid":"22828066","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"323","subjects":["nursing","criticalcare"],"title":"Perceptions of the Care Experience in Critical Care Units Enhanced by a Tele-ICU","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/perceptions-care-experience-critical-care-units-enhanced-teleicu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":2938458,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1425917,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76653,"mean":5.4365998799771,"rank":46843,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":26993,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76653,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":330,"mean":1.1988145896657,"rank":152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":84,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":330,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
