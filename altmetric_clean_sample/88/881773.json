At present, Australia does not have a national plan for rare diseases. To progress such a plan an inaugural Australian Rare Diseases Symposium was held in Western Australia in April 2011. This paper describes the key issues identified by symposium attendees for the development of a national plan, compares these to the content of EUROPLAN and national plans elsewhere and discusses how the outcomes might be integrated for national planning.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000087f","authors":["Caron Molster","Leanne Youngs","Emma Hammond","Hugh Dawkins","Molster C","Youngs L","Hammond E","Dawkins H"],"doi":"10.1186\/1750-1172-7-50","first_seen_on":"2012-08-10T12:33:16+00:00","issns":["","1750-1172"],"issue":"1","journal":"Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1344601863,"links":["http:\/\/www.ojrd.com\/content\/7\/1\/50\/abstract"],"pmid":"22883422","pubdate":"2012-08-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"50","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Key outcomes from stakeholder workshops at a symposium to inform the development of an Australian national plan for rare diseases","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/ojrd.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1750-1172-7-50","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/key-outcomes-stakeholder-workshops-symposium-inform-development-australian-national-plan-rare-diseas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3566212,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":137997,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76523,"mean":5.5097578212802,"rank":61929,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":853,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76523,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":775,"mean":3.3778294573643,"rank":699,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":775,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":4.1729565217391,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":4,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
