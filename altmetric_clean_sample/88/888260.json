Cannabinoid receptors (CB) are widely distributed in human and laboratory animal tissues, justifying the involvement of the endo-cannabinoid system in a great number of metabolic ways. Since there are no data regarding cannabinoid receptors in hair follicles of domestic animals, we investigated the presence and localization of CB1 receptor in dog hair follicles. By using a goat anti-CB1 polyclonal antibody, we observed CB1 receptor in the proximal part of both primary and secondary hair follicles. Staining was localized in the inner root sheath cells. We suppose that the endo-cannabinoid system is involved in the molecular mechanisms regulating hair follicle activity in dog. The identification of CB1 receptor at the level of the inner root sheath may help in the understanding of hair follicle biology and the possibility that cannabinoid molecules could be considered as suitable therapeutic tools in dog.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002150","authors":["Mercati F","Dall'aglio C","Pascucci L","Boiti C","Ceccarelli P"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.acthis.2011.01.003","first_seen_on":"2012-08-15T06:24:13+00:00","issns":["0065-1281"],"issue":"1","journal":"Acta Histochemica","last_mentioned_on":1399011839,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21414652"],"pmid":"21414652","pubdate":"2011-03-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier GmbH.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["histocytochemistry"],"title":"Identification of cannabinoid type 1 receptor in dog hair follicles.","type":"article","volume":"114","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-cannabinoid-type-1-receptor-dog-hair-follicles"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3712057,"mean":4.9755837164128,"rank":692931,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":3012942,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3712057,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73133,"mean":5.1496162555379,"rank":13159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":59832,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73133,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138,"mean":2.6870364963504,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":130,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":3},"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/krazykelly4\/statuses\/235843934805442560","license":"public","rt":["RobbIshcomer"],"citation_ids":[888260],"posted_on":"2012-08-15T21:02:30+00:00","author":{"name":"kelly glass","url":"http:\/\/www.glasslovers420.com","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2477591836\/3kTOTy3r_normal","description":"Miss hightimes oct 2012.owner of gl420. host on hempbeach.tv Activist since 2007. fighter of cervical cancer since 1_18_2011 .RIP TJ.FUCK CANCER...
