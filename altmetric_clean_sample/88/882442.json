In this study, we examined mouse strains in which Runx1, Runx3, or Cbf\u03b2 were deleted in early B lineage progenitors by an mb1-cre transgene. Loss of Runx1, but not Runx3, caused a developmental block during early B lymphopoiesis, resulting in the lack of IgM(+) B cells and reduced V(H) to DJ(H) recombination. Expression of core transcription factors regulating early B cell development, such as E2A, Ebf1, and Pax5, was reduced in B cell precursors lacking Runx1. We detected binding of Runx1-Cbf\u03b2 complexes to the Ebf1 proximal promoter, and these Runx-binding motifs were essential to drive reporter gene expression. Runx1-deficient pro-B cells harbored excessive amounts of the repressive histone mark H3K27 trimethylation in the Ebf1 proximal promoter. Interestingly, retroviral transduction of Ebf1, but not Pax5, into Runx1-deficient progenitors restored not only development of B220(+) cells that underwent V(H) to DJ(H) rearrangement but also expression of B lineage signature genes. Collectively, these results demonstrate that Runx1-Cbf\u03b2 complexes are essential to facilitate B lineage specification, in part via epigenetic activation of the Ebf1 gene.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c77","authors":["Seo W","Ikawa T","Kawamoto H","Taniuchi I"],"doi":"10.1084\/jem.20112745","first_seen_on":"2012-08-10T19:20:35+00:00","issns":["0022-1007","1540-9538"],"issue":"","journal":"The Journal of Experimental Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1344384000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22665574","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1084\/jem.20112745"],"pmid":"22665574","pubdate":"2012-06-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["medicine","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Runx1\u2013Cbf\u03b2 facilitates early B lymphocyte development by regulating expression of Ebf1","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/runx1cbf%CE%B2-facilitates-early-b-lymphocyte-development-regulating-expression-ebf1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635033,"mean":4.9228440290343,"rank":2018194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":945377,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635033,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73325,"mean":5.0823705744367,"rank":34875,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":26283,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73325,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2723,"mean":3.4232740631888,"rank":1427,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":405,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2723,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.3611111111111,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
