One proposed mechanism to explain this inefficiency is provided by the cancer stem cell model, which hypothesizes that micrometastases can only be established by tumour stem cells, which are few in number. However, recent in vitro and in vivo observations indicate that apoptosis is an important process regulating metastasis. Here we stress that the inhibition of cell death, apart from its extensively described function in primary tumour development, is a crucial characteristic of metastatic cancer cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f610003168","authors":["Patrick Mehlen","Alain Puisieux"],"doi":"10.1038\/nrc1886","endpage":"458","first_seen_on":"2012-08-13T12:37:31+00:00","issns":["1474-175X","1474-1768"],"issue":"6","journal":"Nature Reviews Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1481133600,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nrc\/journal\/v6\/n6\/full\/nrc1886.html","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/nrc1886","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16723991"],"pmid":"16723991","pubdate":"2006-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"449","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Metastasis: a question of life or death","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metastasis-question-life-death"},"altmetric_score":{"score":46.08,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":46.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7856296,"mean":6.655704591281,"rank":177166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":7679183,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7856296,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96291,"mean":5.8580592377194,"rank":1773,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":94518,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96291,"percentile":98},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1364,"mean":8.534572267058,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":1329,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1364,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":3.606875,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":7,"Professor > Associate Professor":37,"Student  > Doctoral Student":52,"Researcher":124,"Student  > Ph.
