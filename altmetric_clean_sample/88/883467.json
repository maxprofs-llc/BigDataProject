Cord blood can be used as an alternative source for bone marrow transplantation and its use is developing into a new field of treatment for pediatric and adult patients presenting with hematological disorders, immunological defects and specific genetic diseases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cad","authors":["Merlin G.
