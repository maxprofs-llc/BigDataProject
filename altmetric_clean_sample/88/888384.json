An important potential contribution towards achieving the MDGs for persons with disabilities will be the newly developed Guidelines for Community Based Rehabilitation (CBR), launched in 2010. Given the global shortage of medical and nursing personnel and highly skilled rehabilitation practitioners, effective implementation of the CBR guidelines will require additional health workers, with improved distribution and a new skill set, allowing them to work across the health, education, livelihoods, social, and development sectors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000830","authors":["Hasheem Mannan","Camille Boostrom","Malcolm MacLachlan","Eilish McAuliffe","Chapal Khasnabis","Neeru Gupta","Mannan H","Boostrom C","Maclachlan M","McAuliffe E","Khasnabis C","Gupta N"],"doi":"10.1186\/1478-4491-10-20","first_seen_on":"2012-08-15T08:19:40+00:00","issns":["","1478-4491"],"issue":"1","journal":"Human Resources for Health","last_mentioned_on":1345018394,"links":["http:\/\/www.human-resources-health.com\/content\/10\/1\/20\/abstract","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/1478-4491-10-20"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/human-resources-health.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/1478-4491-10-20?site=human-resources-health.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"22888953","pubdate":"2012-08-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"20","title":"A systematic review of the effectiveness of alternative cadres in community based rehabilitation","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/human-resources-health.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1478-4491-10-20","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/systematic-review-effectiveness-alternative-cadres-community-based-rehabilitation-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4998211,"mean":5.91499865152,"rank":4178882,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4998211,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78206,"mean":5.7660903011316,"rank":65010,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78206,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":396,"mean":6.3253316455696,"rank":391,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":396,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":3.64152,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
