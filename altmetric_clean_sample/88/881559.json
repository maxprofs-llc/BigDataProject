Computerized physician order-entry (CPOE) systems, coupled with decision support (Medication allergy checking, drug interactions, and dose calculations), are considered to be appropriate solutions for reducing medication errors and standardizing care. It is quite useful if clinical information system (CIS) supports order sets, which help with standardizing care, preventing omission errors, and expediting the ordering process. Order sets are predefined groups of orders pertinent to one or more specific clinical conditions or diagnoses. The article describes how a clinical information system can be used to support medication process (prescribing, ordering, dispensing, administration and monitoring) and offer participating medical teams real time warnings and key information regarding medications and patient status, thus reducing medication errors. Integrated electronic prescribing support system benefits for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) are discussed at the end.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa67f3cf058f6100098a4","first_seen_on":"2012-08-10T10:16:19+00:00","issns":["0926-9630"],"journal":"Studies in Health Technology & Informatics","last_mentioned_on":1344972500,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22874280?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22874280","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Slovenia.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Library And Information Studies","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["healthservicesresearch","medicalinformatics"],"title":"Electronic medication ordering with integrated drug database and clinical decision support system.","type":"article","volume":"180","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/electronic-medication-ordering-integrated-drug-database-clinical-decision-support-system"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506762,"mean":5.1233691071599,"rank":2124050,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2212389,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506762,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76522,"mean":5.4287181558003,"rank":32090,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":40880,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76522,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":791,"mean":1.5379215189873,"rank":209,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":544,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":791,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":1.6387096774194,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
