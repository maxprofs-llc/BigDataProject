A common treatment, surgical anterior capsule tightening, assumes that the instability is caused by abnormal anterior laxity. This study investigated the possibility that one element of overall imbalance, posterior capsular tightness, could be an underlying reason for shoulder instability. Surgical navigation technology, which is more accurate than whole-body motion-capture systems, was used to study anterior translational motions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61d3cf058f610007867","authors":["Zakani S","Venne G","Smith EJ","Bicknell R","Ellis RE"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11548-012-0782-6","first_seen_on":"2012-08-14T10:29:35+00:00","funders":["cihr"],"issns":["1861-6410"],"issue":"","journal":"International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1344940056,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22855410"],"pmid":"22855410","pubdate":"2012-08-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Computer Science, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Health Informatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Imaging \/ Radiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["radiology","generalsurgery"],"title":"Analyzing shoulder translation with navigation technology.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/analyzing-shoulder-translation-navigation-technology"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506762,"mean":5.1233691071599,"rank":3107814,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":976380,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506762,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76156,"mean":5.4618017989626,"rank":49885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":17794,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76156,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":1.4439189189189,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
