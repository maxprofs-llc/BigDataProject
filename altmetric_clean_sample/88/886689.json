This paper aims to analyze the feasibility and safety of single-incision laparoscopic colectomy (SILC) and its potential benefits. Methods. Systematic review was performed for the years 1983-August 2011 to retrieve all relevant literature. A total of 21 studies with 477 patients undergoing SILC were selected. Results. Range of operative times and estimated blood losses were 75-229\u2009min and 0-100\u2009mL, respectively. Overall conversion rate was 5.9% (28\/477) and an additional laparoscopic port was used in 4.9% (16\/329) cases. Range of lymph node number for malignant cases was 12-24.6 and surgical margins were all negative. Overall mortality and morbidity rate was 0.4% (2\/477) and 11.7% (43\/368), respectively. The length of hospital stay (LOS) varied across reports (2.7-9.2 days). Among 6 case-matched studies, one showed less blood loss in SILC as compared to LAC and 2 showed shorter LOS after SILC versus HALC or LAC\/HALC groups. In addition, one study reported maximum pain score on postoperative days 1 and 2 was lower in SILS compared to LAC and HALC. Conclusions. SILC procedure is feasible and safe when performed by surgeons highly skilled in laparoscopy. In spite of technical difficulties, there may be potential benefits associated with SILC over LAC\/HALC.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f61000421a","doi":"10.1155\/2012\/783074","first_seen_on":"2012-08-14T10:21:23+00:00","issns":["2090-1453"],"journal":"Minimally Invasive Surgery (20901445)","last_mentioned_on":1344939543,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22888419?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22888419","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Single-incision laparoscopic surgeries for colorectal diseases: early experiences of a novel surgical method.","type":"article","volume":"2012","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/singleincision-laparoscopic-surgeries-colorectal-diseases-early-experiences-novel-surgical-method"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3616176,"mean":4.9318698536468,"rank":2902491,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":71209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3616176,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72846,"mean":5.1713189100144,"rank":54217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":238,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72846,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":1.1735675675676,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1.35,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
