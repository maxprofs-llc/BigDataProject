From something as mundane as bipolar cautery to sophisticated intraoperative navigation with real-time magnetic resonance imaging-assisted surgical guidance, both technologies, however simple or complex, require computational processing power to function. The next frontier for neurosurgery involves developing a greater understanding of the brain and furthering our capabilities as surgeons to directly affect brain circuitry and function.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d13","authors":["Lee B","Liu CY","Apuzzo ML"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.wneu.2012.07.013","first_seen_on":"2012-08-14T16:27:33+00:00","issns":["1878-8750"],"issue":"","journal":"World Neurosurgery","last_mentioned_on":1344961524,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22846655"],"pmid":"22846655","pubdate":"2012-08-02T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["neurosurgery"],"title":"Quantum Computing: A Prime Modality in Neurosurgery's Future.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quantum-computing-prime-modality-neurosurgerys-future"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":3557515,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":831176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78731,"mean":5.7677616410517,"rank":52054,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":13383,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78731,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":546,"mean":1.8949981651376,"rank":305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":546,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":2.87375,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":4,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Physics and Astronomy":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Computer Science":3,"Business, Management and Accounting":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1,"BR":1,"MX":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/chili_v8\/statuses\/235411812785463296","license":"public","citation_ids":[887336],"posted_on":"2012-08-14T16:25:24+00:00","author":{"name":"neuroRBT","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1731983343\/rbt_7_normal.JPG","description":"Brain scientist, PhD.
