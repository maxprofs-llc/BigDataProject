Human ASC Angiogenic Potential Reversed by Hypoxia Preconditioning ROS Production"],"citation":{"abstract":"Adipose stroma\/stem cells (ASC) represent an ideal source of autologous cells for cell-based therapy. Their transplantation enhances neovascularization after experimental ischemic injury. Aging is associated with a progressive decrease in the regenerative potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from bone marrow. This work aims to determine the aging effect on human ASC capacities. First, we show that aging impairs angiogenic capacities of human ASC (hASC) in a mouse ischemic hindlimb model. Although no change in hASC number, phenotype, and proliferation was observed with aging, several mechanisms involved in the adverse effects of aging have been identified in vitro combining a concomitant decrease in (i) ASC ability to differentiate towards endothelial cells, (ii) secretion of proangiogenic and pro-survival factors, and (iii) oxidative stress. These effects were counteracted by a hypoxic preconditioning that improved in vivo angiogenic capacities of hASC from older donors, while hASC from young donors that have a strong ability to manage hypoxic stress were not. Finally, we identified reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation as a key signal of hypoxia on hASC angiogenic capacities. This study demonstrates for the first time that age of donor impaired angiogenic capacities of hASC in ischemic muscle and change in ROS generation by hypoxic preconditioning reverse the adverse effect of aging.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5083cf058f61000311d","authors":["Sandra De Barros","St|[eacute]|phanie Dehez","Emmanuelle Arnaud","Corinne Barreau","Alexandre Cazavet","Guillaume Perez","Anne Galinier","Louis Casteilla","Val|[eacute]|rie Planat-B|[eacute]|nard","St\u00e9phanie Dehez","Val\u00e9rie Planat-B\u00e9nard"],"doi":"10.1038\/mt.2012.213","endpage":"408","first_seen_on":"2013-02-16T02:22:23+00:00","issns":["1525-0016","1525-0024","15250016"],"issue":"2","journal":"Molecular Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1497454250,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/mt\/journal\/v21\/n2\/full\/mt2012213a.html","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1525001616306001"],"pmid":"23070114","pubdate":"2012-10-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"399","subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Aging-related Decrease of Human ASC Angiogenic Potential Is Reversed by Hypoxia Preconditioning Through ROS Production","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/agingrelated-decrease-human-asc-angiogenic-potential-reversed-hypoxia-preconditioning-through-ros-pr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366012,"mean":7.0543497525808,"rank":4218424,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3932583,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366012,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117441,"mean":6.6267346730246,"rank":53653,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":60112,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117441,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1296,"mean":10.220798455598,"rank":846,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":415,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1296,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":23.419862068966,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
