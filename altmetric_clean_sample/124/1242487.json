We reviewed the published literature on MEDLINE from articles between 1950 and 2008 on the non-atheroprotective effects of statins and noted consistent benefits of statin use in improving outcomes of ventricular arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death, cardiac transplant rejection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and sepsis. However, for these conditions, the level of evidence was inadequate to recommend statin use. The evidence for improving outcomes in atrial fibrillation, mortality in heart failure, contrast-induced nephropathy, cataract, age-related macular degeneration, sub-arachnoid hemorrhage, osteoporosis, dementia, and cancer incidence was conflicting and inconclusive. Furthermore, we found that most of the literature consists of small observational studies and their conclusions are often not corroborated by results from larger or randomized studies. Pending large, well designed, randomized trials, we conclude that there is no definite evidence for the use of statins in any condition besides hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021f1","authors":["Beri A","Sural N","Mahajan SB"],"doi":"10.2165\/11315710-000000000-00000","first_seen_on":"2013-02-15T20:24:22+00:00","issns":["1175-3277","1179-187X"],"issue":"6","journal":"American Journal of Cardiovascular Drugs","last_mentioned_on":1360713600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19929034","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.2165\/11315710-000000000-00000"],"pmid":"19929034","pubdate":"2009-11-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Non-Atheroprotective Effects of Statins","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nonatheroprotective-effects-statins-systematic-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3619418,"mean":4.9280690829525,"rank":2016368,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":927199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3619418,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":290323,"mean":5.8464972616613,"rank":155396,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":82163,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":290323,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":2.7706829268293,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
