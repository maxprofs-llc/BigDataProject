One hundred and forty-four patients, excluding patients with primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, were enrolled in this study. The volume of saliva secreted was measured with the screening technique for estimation of salivary flow, which uses a filter paper for diagnosing dry mouth. Disturbed salivary secretion was observed in 84 (58.3 %) of the 144 patients. In the case of patients free of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, the prevalence of disturbed salivary secretion differed significantly among the disease groups (P < 0.05), with the prevalence being over 50 % in all disease groups other than the rheumatoid arthritis group and the highest in the systemic sclerosis group. There was significant positive correlation between the number of colored spots and oral visual analog scale score (r = 0.45, P < 0.0001). Autoimmune diseases can be accompanied by salivary gland dysfunction, regardless of the presence\/absence of complication by Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. In the present study, the screening technique for estimation of salivary flow, which uses a filter paper for diagnosing dry mouth, was shown to be a useful means of detecting salivary gland dysfunction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f61000349a","authors":["Maeshima E","Furukawa K","Maeshima S","Koshiba H","Sakamoto W"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00296-012-2611-1","first_seen_on":"2013-02-19T12:43:02+00:00","issns":["0172-8172"],"issue":"12","journal":"Rheumatology International","last_mentioned_on":1412800525,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23274440","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23274440?dopt=Citation","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3832768\/"],"pmid":"23274440","pubdate":"2013-01-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Rheumatology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"Hyposalivation in autoimmune diseases","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hyposalivation-autoimmune-diseases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5234237,"mean":6.1676477996049,"rank":2255271,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":2908147,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5234237,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94380,"mean":6.552822132042,"rank":35193,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":57775,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94380,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":644,"mean":3.0812721617418,"rank":236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":386,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":644,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":1.9357222222222,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
