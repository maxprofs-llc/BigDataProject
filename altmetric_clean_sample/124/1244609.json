It is diagnosed by history, physical exam and objective testing. Patient education, environmental control measures, pharmacotherapy, and allergen-specific immunotherapy are the cornerstones of allergic rhinitis treatment and can significantly reduce the burden of disease. Current treatment guidelines include antihistamines, intranasal corticosteroids, oral and intranasal decongestants, intranasal anticholinergics, intranasal cromolyn, and leukotriene receptor antagonists. In the mechanism of allergic rhinitis, histamine is responsible for major allergic rhinitis symptoms such as rhinorrhea, nasal itching and sneezing. Its effect on nasal congestion is less evident. In contrast, leukotrienes result in increase in nasal airway resistance and vascular permeability. Antihistamines and leukotriene receptor antagonists are commonly used in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. The published literature about combined antihistamines and leukotriene antagonists in mono- or combination therapy is reviewed and presented.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007046","authors":["Beng\u00c3\u00bc \u00c3\u0087obano\u00c4\u009flu","Elina Toskala","Ahmet Ural","Cemal Cingi","Beng\u00fc \u00c7obano\u011flu"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11882-013-0341-4","first_seen_on":"2013-02-17T04:37:34+00:00","issns":["1534-6315","1529-7322"],"journal":"Current Allergy and Asthma Reports","last_mentioned_on":1366389601,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs11882-013-0341-4"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs11882-013-0341-4","pmid":"23389557","pubdate":"2013-02-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Current Science Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Allergology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pulmonarymedicine","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Role of Leukotriene Antagonists and Antihistamines in the Treatment of Allergic Rhinitis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-leukotriene-antagonists-antihistamines-treatment-allergic-rhinitis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":1989994,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2420229,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88985,"mean":6.3213644475412,"rank":35574,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":50887,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88985,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":349,"mean":3.0494942528736,"rank":161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":175,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":349,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":3.9695,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
