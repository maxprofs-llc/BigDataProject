Protonations to three ether oxygen atoms of the sucrose molecule, A, B, and (C, D), were compared. Three (B, the fructosyl-ring oxygen protonation; C, protonation to the bridge oxygen of the glycosidic bond for the glucosyl-oxygen cleavage; and D, protonation to that for the fructosyl-oxygen cleavage) gave the fragmentation. Paths B, C, and D were examined by the use of the sucrose molecule and H3O(+)(H2O)13. The path B needs a large activation energy, indicating that it is unlikely. The fragmentation transition state (TS1) of path C needs almost the same activation energy as that of path D. The isomerization TS of Int(C) \u2192 Int(D), TS(C \u2192 D), was also obtained as a bypass route. The present calculations showed that the path via the fructosyl-oxygen cleavage (D) is slightly (not absolutely) more favorable than that via the glucosyl-oxygen cleavage (C).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e9f","authors":["Shinichi Yamabe"],"doi":"10.1021\/jo3027565","first_seen_on":"2013-02-15T22:42:58+00:00","issns":["0022-3263"],"journal":"Journal of Organic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1360888726,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jo3027565"],"pmid":"23373870","pubdate":"2013-02-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Three Competitive Transition States at the Glycosidic Bond of Sucrose in Its Acid-Catalyzed Hydrolysis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/three-competitive-transition-states-glycosidic-bond-sucrose-acidcatalyzed-hydrolysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631167,"mean":4.9271322908448,"rank":2898695,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":80454,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631167,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":290496,"mean":5.8180390437012,"rank":231377,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1039,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":290496,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2673,"mean":2.7652425149701,"rank":1977,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":145,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2673,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79,"mean":1.7833333333333,"rank":66,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
