During routine molecular screening of apicomplexan parasites in reptiles using the 18S rRNA gene, we have amplified and sequenced Proteromonas parasites from three lizard hosts (less than 1% prevalence). We conducted phylogenetic analysis to confirm the taxonomic position and infer their relationships with other stramenopiles. Although our phylogeny is limited due to scarcity of molecular data on these protists, our results confirm they are closely related to Proteromonas lacertae. Our findings show that unexpected parasites can be amplified from host samples (blood and tissue) using general procedures to detect hemoparasites, and stress that positive PCR amplifications alone should not be considered as definitive proof of infection by particular parasites. Further validation by sequence confirmation and thorough phylogenetic assessment will not only avoid false positives and biased prevalence estimates but also provide valuable information on the biodiversity and phylogenetic relationships of other parasitic organisms. More generally, our results illustrate the perils of general diagnosis protocols in parasitological studies and the need of cross-validation procedures.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008dbe","authors":["Maia JP","G\u00f3mez-D\u00edaz E","Harris DJ"],"doi":"10.2478\/s11686-012-0048-z","first_seen_on":"2013-02-16T20:29:11+00:00","issns":["1230-2821"],"issue":"4","journal":"Acta Parasitologica","last_mentioned_on":1361039197,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23129192"],"pmid":"23129192","pubdate":"2012-11-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"Apicomplexa primers amplify Proteromonas (Stramenopiles, Slopalinida, Proteromonadidae) in tissue and blood samples from lizards.","type":"article","volume":"57","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/apicomplexa-primers-amplify-proteromonas-stramenopiles-slopalinida-proteromonadidae-tissue-blood-sam"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
