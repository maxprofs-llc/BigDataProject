Anesthesiologists, currently poorly represented in the rapidly evolving specialties of hospice and palliative medicine, are uniquely qualified to contribute to the comprehensive care of patients who are in this category. Anesthesiologists' interpersonal capabilities in the management of patients and families under duress, their knowledge and comfort level with the application of potent analgesic and consciousness-altering pharmacology, and their titrating and monitoring skills would add a valuable dimension to palliative care teams. This article summarizes the state of the art and means by which anesthesiologists might contribute to improvements in the important end-of-life outcome of safe and comfortable dying.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f61000571e","authors":["Fine PG"],"doi":"10.1213\/01.ane.0000141061.74294.de","first_seen_on":"2013-02-17T13:57:37+00:00","issns":["0003-2999"],"issue":"1","journal":"Anesthesia and analgesia","last_mentioned_on":1361109450,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15616075"],"pmid":"15616075","pubdate":"2004-12-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["anesthesiology"],"title":"The evolving and important role of anesthesiology in palliative care.","type":"article","volume":"100","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evolving-important-role-anesthesiology-palliative-care"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":3078429,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":958271,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88986,"mean":6.3218232735855,"rank":59530,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":18841,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88986,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2684,"mean":2.6656280283265,"rank":1828,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":571,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2684,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103,"mean":2.346568627451,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
