In the present study, the usefulness of chromogenic medium, slide culture technique and Vitek2 Compact (V2C) has been analysed. A total of 173 clinical isolates of yeast species were included in the study. An algorithm to identify such isolates in routine clinical microbiology laboratory was prepared and followed. Chromogenic medium was able to identify Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis and Trichosporon asahii. Chromogenic medium was also helpful in identifying \"multi-species\" yeast infections. The medium was unable to provide presumptive identification of C. pelliculosa, C. utilis, C. rugosa, C. glabrata and C. hemulonii. Vitek 2 compact (V2C) differentiated all pseudohypae non-producing yeast species. The algorithm followed was helpful in timely presumptive identification and final diagnosis of yeast infections, including multi-species yeast infections.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002aac","authors":["Agarwal"],"doi":"10.4103\/0255-0857.81794","first_seen_on":"2013-02-18T10:38:06+00:00","issns":["0255-0857"],"issue":"2","journal":"Indian Journal of Medical Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1472869884,"links":["http:\/\/www.ijmm.org\/article.asp?issn=0255-0857;year=2011;volume=29;issue=2;spage=172;epage=177;aulast=Agarwal"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ijmm.org\/article.asp?issn=0255-0857;year=2011;volume=29;issue=2;spage=172;epage=177;aulast=Agarwal;type=2","pmid":"21654115","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medknow Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Yeast identification in routine clinical microbiology laboratory and its clinical relevance","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/yeast-identification-routine-clinical-microbiology-laboratory-clinical-relevance"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8320311,"mean":7.0122256031246,"rank":3941040,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4194412,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8320311,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117663,"mean":6.5958393194066,"rank":48978,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":65354,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117663,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":360,"mean":1.7243286908078,"rank":131,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":360,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":2.125,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Immunology and Microbiology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"NG":1,"VE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/peejayadeyoju\/status\/303450222913277952","citation_ids":[1246253],"posted_on":"2013-02-18T10:25:45+00:00","author":{"name":"ADEYOJU A.O","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3238338194\/41aa76dd55e5e18a5083ba05f5539aaa_normal.jpeg","description":"I AM ME.
