However, harvesting of bone marrow is always associated with some potential morbidity. It was recently revealed that adipose derived stromal cells contain a cell population with multipotency. In addition to an adequate supply, these cells do not appear to decline with age. The purpose of our study was to assess osteogenic capability of these cells in vitro and in vivo.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f48","authors":["Zou, Jun","Wang, Genlin","Geng, Dechun","Zhu, Xuesong","Gan, Minfeng","Yang, Huilin"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jss.2009.07.021","first_seen_on":"2013-02-16T14:24:47+00:00","issns":["0022-4804"],"journal":"Journal of Surgical Research","last_mentioned_on":1361024304,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0022480409003916"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.journalofsurgicalresearch.com\/article\/S0022-4804(09)00391-6\/pdf","pmid":"20070984","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"A Novel Cell-Based Therapy in Segmental Bone Defect: Using Adipose Derived Stromal Cells","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-cellbased-therapy-segmental-bone-defect-using-adipose-derived-stromal-cells-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631265,"mean":4.9266893682253,"rank":2015188,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":943834,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631265,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84941,"mean":6.0535195902991,"rank":42805,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":27310,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84941,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":877,"mean":1.6680502283105,"rank":427,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":313,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":877,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":0.79047619047619,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/fedatny_walla\/status\/302783994930552832","citation_ids":[1243777],"posted_on":"2013-02-16T14:18:24+00:00","author":{"name":"Fatma Abdou","url":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fatma.Abdou.Photography","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3051264149\/8b97916e1a71d24bc49c321b9fe4a8f4_normal.jpeg","description":"A Muslim Girl..
