The task is considered high risk based on weight limits and awkward positioning. A task force including representatives from the National Association of Orthopaedic Nurses, the American Nurses Association, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the Patient Safety Center of Inquiry at the James A. Haley Veterans Administration Medical Center in Tampa, Diligent Services, and Guldmann, Inc., developed an ergonomic tool for determining best practices for safe vertical transfers. Current concepts of ergonomic safety, scientific evidence, and safe patient-handling equipment and devices were incorporated into this ergonomic tool.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005bf6","doi":"10.1097\/nor.0b013e3181998897","first_seen_on":"2013-02-17T02:05:27+00:00","issns":["0744-6020"],"issue":"2S","journal":"Orthopaedic Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1361066722,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/orthopaedicnursing\/Abstract\/2009\/03001\/Recommendations_for_Vertical_Transfer_of_a.4.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/orthopaedicnursing\/2009\/03001\/Recommendations_for_Vertical_Transfer_of_a.4.pdf","pmid":"19339852","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"S13","subjects":["nursing","orthopedics"],"title":"Recommendations for Vertical Transfer of a Postoperative Total Hip Replacement Patient (Bed to Chair, Chair to Toilet, Chair to Chair, or Car to Chair)","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/recommendations-vertical-transfer-postoperative-total-hip-replacement-patient-bed-chair-chair-toilet"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":2933724,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1428990,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88986,"mean":6.3250435017138,"rank":56126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":29544,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88986,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":465,"mean":1.0078232758621,"rank":173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":223,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":465,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
