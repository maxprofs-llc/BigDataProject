Clinical assessment of all available data is then the only option to come to a final conclusion. We evaluated the diagnostic work-up of a large cohort of Dutch patients who applied for financial compensation due to mesothelioma. We determined how often a pathological or clinical diagnosis can be made, and which factors are associated with making the final diagnosis malignant mesothelioma.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4fe3cf058f610003039","doi":"10.1016\/j.lungcan.2013.01.012","first_seen_on":"2013-02-19T21:24:31+00:00","issns":["1872-8332"],"journal":"Lung Cancer (01695002)","last_mentioned_on":1361309071,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23415607"],"pmid":"23415607","pubdate":"2013-02-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Legal claims for malignant mesothelioma: Dealing with all cases.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/legal-claims-malignant-mesothelioma-dealing-cases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":1989198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2419624,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89308,"mean":6.3169689274078,"rank":35713,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":50835,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89308,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":485,"mean":2.433347107438,"rank":165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":307,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":485,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":2.135,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
