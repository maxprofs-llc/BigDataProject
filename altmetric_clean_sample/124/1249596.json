However, data on this relationship in young persons are scarce, and neurodietary research in this age group is limited compared with the extensive literature on adults. Here, we aimed to explore the effects of a diminished central nervous 5-HT synthesis, which is achieved by acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) Moja-De , on memory function in young males with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002163","authors":["Zepf, F.
