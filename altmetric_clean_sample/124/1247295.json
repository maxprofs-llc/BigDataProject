We report a case of a grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma 'drop' lesion invading a previous C-S scar with resultant cervical stromal invasion. Using both MR images and a thorough review of the pathology, the tumor at the C-S scar was determined to be an implant derived from a primary lesion at the uterine fundus. With increases in the incidence of both endometrial cancer and births by C-S, it is likely we will encounter more cases of iatrogenic implants of endometrial cancers in C-S scars.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e90","authors":["Baba T","Mandai M","Yamanishi Y","Suzuki A","Kang HS","Konishi I"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1447-0756.2010.01381.x","first_seen_on":"2013-02-18T21:55:27+00:00","issns":["1341-8076"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology Research","last_mentioned_on":1361224570,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21314809"],"pmid":"21314809","pubdate":"2011-02-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Online Library","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Endometrial cancer implanted within a cesarean section scar.","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/endometrial-cancer-implanted-within-cesarean-section-scar"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633255,"mean":4.9221505741186,"rank":2897852,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":82007,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633255,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85371,"mean":6.0139720510719,"rank":65145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":403,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85371,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":336,"mean":2.3142985074627,"rank":204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":336,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.3857142857143,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
