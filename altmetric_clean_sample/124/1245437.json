This is reflected by the assumption in linkage studies of a penetrance of 90%. We had previously suggested that a larger-than-anticipated number of LQTS patients might be affected without showing clinical signs. We have now exploited the availability of molecular diagnosis to test this hypothesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100057f2","authors":["Silvia G.
