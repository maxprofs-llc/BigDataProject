See our recent paper"],"citation":{"abstract":"Gelatin-methacrylamide (gelMA) hydrogels are shown to support chondrocyte viability and differentiation and give wide ranging mechanical properties depending on several cross-linking parameters. Polymer concentration, UV exposure time, and thermal gelation prior to UV exposure allow for control over hydrogel stiffness and swelling properties. GelMA solutions have a low viscosity at 37\u2009\u00b0C, which is incompatible with most biofabrication approaches. However, incorporation of hyaluronic acid (HA) and\/or co-deposition with thermoplastics allows gelMA to be used in biofabrication processes. These attributes may allow engineered constructs to match the natural functional variations in cartilage mechanical and geometrical properties.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f610008093","authors":["Schuurman W","Levett PA","Pot MW","van Weeren PR","Dhert WJ","Hutmacher DW","Melchels FP","Klein TJ","Malda J","Schuurman, Wouter","Levett, Peter A.","Pot, Michiel W.","van Weeren, Paul Ren\u00e9","Dhert, Wouter J.
