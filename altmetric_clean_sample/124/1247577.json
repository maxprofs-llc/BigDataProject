Though highly related, the Salmonella lineages may be strictly adapted to different hosts or cause different diseases, from mild local illness like gastroenteritis to fatal systemic infections like typhoid. Therefore, rapid and accurate identification of Salmonella is essential for timely and correct diagnosis of Salmonella infections. The current identification methods such as 16S rRNA sequencing and multilocus sequence typing are expensive and time consuming. Additionally, these methods often do not have sufficient distinguishing resolution among the Salmonella lineages.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Qing-Hua Zou","Ren-Qing Li","Ye-Jun Wang","Shu-Lin Liu"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0055988","first_seen_on":"2013-02-19T01:30:50+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"2","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1361235910,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0055988?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+plosone%2FPLoSONE+%28PLoS+ONE+Alerts%3A+New+Articles%29"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0055988.pdf","pmid":"23441160","pubdate":"2013-02-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e55988","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Identification of Genes to Differentiate Closely Related Salmonella Lineages","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-genes-differentiate-closely-related-salmonella-lineages"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3619417,"mean":4.9286052998637,"rank":2903934,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":71634,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3619417,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85332,"mean":6.0392372525811,"rank":65438,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":167,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85332,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64037,"mean":8.3194640514711,"rank":50375,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":165,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64037,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4420,"mean":7.3482290110885,"rank":3239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4420,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
