We developed a glycan-based immunoassay, FastLec-Hepa, to fill this unmet need. FastLec-Hepa automatically detects unique fibrosis-related glyco-alteration in serum hyperglycosylated Mac-2 binding protein within 20\u2005min. The serum FastLec-Hepa counts increased with advancing fibrosis and illustrated significant differences in medians between all fibrosis stages. FastLec-Hepa is sufficiently sensitive and quantitative to evaluate the effects of PEG-interferon-\u03b1\/ribavirin therapy in a short post-therapeutic interval. The obtained fibrosis progression is equivalent to -0.30 stages\/year in patients with sustained virological response, and 0.01 stages\/year in relapse\/nonresponders. Furthermore, long-term follow-up of the severely affected patients found hepatocellular carcinoma developed in patients after therapy whose FastLec-Hepa counts remained above a designated cutoff value. FastLec-Hepa is the only assay currently available for clinically beneficial therapy evaluation through quantitation of disease severity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Atsushi Kuno","Yuzuru Ikehara","Yasuhito Tanaka","Kiyoaki Ito","Atsushi Matsuda","Satoru Sekiya","Shuhei Hige","Michiie Sakamoto","Masayoshi Kage","Masashi Mizokami","Hisashi Narimatsu"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep01065","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2013-02-15T00:02:13+00:00","issns":["2045-2322","xxxx-xxxx"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1394237057,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/srep\/2013\/130115\/srep01065\/full\/srep01065.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/srep\/2013\/130115\/srep01065\/fig_tab\/srep01065_F2.html"],"pmid":"23323209","pubdate":"2013-01-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Glycobiology","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Biochemical assays","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Assay systems","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"ELISA","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"","subjects":["science"],"title":"A serum \u00e2\u0080\u009csweet-doughnut\u00e2\u0080\u009d protein facilitates fibrosis evaluation and therapy assessment in patients with viral hepatitis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/serum-sweetdoughnut-protein-facilitates-fibrosis-evaluation-therapy-assessment-patients-viral-hepati"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5032959,"mean":5.9653559095836,"rank":2311244,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2594736,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5032959,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":299725,"mean":6.2588086439524,"rank":121030,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":168729,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":299725,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15806,"mean":13.331097121164,"rank":7608,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":7644,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15806,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":530,"mean":15.24802268431,"rank":312,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":204,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":530,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
