It has become clear that under the pressure of the host's immune system, cancer cells have adapted elaborate tactics to reduce their immunogenicity (also known as immunoselection) and\/or to actively suppress immune cells and promote immune tolerance (also known as immunosubversion). In this issue of the European Journal of Immunology, Dolen and Esendagli [Eur. J. Immunol. 2013. 43: 747-757] show that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells develop an adaptive immune phenotype switching mechanism: In response to attack by activated T cells, the leukemia cells quickly downregulate the T-cell costimulatory ligand B7-H2 and reciprocally upregulate the coinhibitory ligands B7-H1 and B7-DC in order to shut down T-cell activation via the PD-1 pathway. These novel findings and their relevance for cancer immunotherapy, especially potential applications in PD-1 check-point blockade therapy are discussed in this Commentary.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f610007351","authors":["Yao S","Chen L"],"doi":"10.1002\/eji.201243275","endpage":"579","first_seen_on":"2013-02-18T00:25:45+00:00","funders":["nci","niaid"],"issns":["0014-2980"],"issue":"3","journal":"European Journal of Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1361146921,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23381914?dopt=Citation"],"pmid":"23381914","pubdate":"2013-02-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"576","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Adaptive resistance: a tumor strategy to evade immune attack.","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adaptive-resistance-tumor-strategy-evade-immune-attack"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":3079512,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":959284,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89220,"mean":6.2950567255854,"rank":59907,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":19171,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89220,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1432,"mean":1.79678546471,"rank":940,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":326,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1432,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":6.34375,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
