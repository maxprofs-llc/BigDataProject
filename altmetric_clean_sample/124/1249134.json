In this article, I present a situation-specific theory that explains the unique cancer pain experience of Asian Americans. Unlike other existing theories, this situation-specific theory was developed on the basis of evidence, including a systematic literature review and research findings, making it comprehensive and highly applicable to research and practice with Asian American patients with cancer. Thus, this theory would strengthen the interconnections among theory, evidence, and practice in pain management for Asian American cancer patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f6100056d2","doi":"10.1097\/01.ans.0000341412.02177.77","first_seen_on":"2013-02-19T16:14:27+00:00","issns":["0161-9268"],"issue":"4","journal":"Advances in Nursing Science","last_mentioned_on":1360853682,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/advancesinnursingscience\/Fulltext\/2008\/10000\/The_Situation_Specific_Theory_of_Pain_Experience.6.aspx?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/advancesinnursingscience\/2008\/10000\/The_Situation_Specific_Theory_of_Pain_Experience.6.pdf","pmid":"19033747","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Lippincott Williams & Wilkins","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"319","subjects":["nursing"],"title":"The Situation-Specific Theory of Pain Experience for Asian American Cancer Patients","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/situationspecific-theory-pain-experience-asian-american-cancer-patients-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628077,"mean":4.9442940120368,"rank":2904654,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75251,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628077,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85444,"mean":6.0383990262515,"rank":65437,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":254,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85444,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174,"mean":1.2956647398844,"rank":115,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"The Situation-Specific Theory of Pain Experience for Asian A... : Advances in Nursing Science","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=483134338389288&id=119297461480504","citation_ids":[1249134],"posted_on":"2013-02-14T14:54:42+00:00","summary":"Most Popular:","author":{"name":"Advances in Nursing Science","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/119297461480504","facebook_wall_name":"Advances in Nursing Science","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/119297461480504\/picture","id_on_source":"119297461480504"}}]}}
