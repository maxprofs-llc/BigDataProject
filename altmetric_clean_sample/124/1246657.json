Cervical disc arthroplasty was theoretically designed to be an ideal substitute for fusion by preserving motion at the operative level and delaying adjacent level degeneration. However, it remains unclear whether arthroplasty achieves that aim.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000256d","authors":["Si Yin MD","Xiao Yu MD","Shuangli Zhou MD","Zhanhai Yin PhD","Yusheng Qiu PhD"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11999-013-2830-0","first_seen_on":"2013-02-18T15:01:00+00:00","issns":["1528-1132","0009-921X"],"journal":"Clinical Orthopaedics & Related Research","last_mentioned_on":1376969150,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs11999-013-2830-0"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs11999-013-2830-0","pmid":"23389804","pubdate":"2013-02-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer-Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Conservative Orthopedics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Orthopedics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Sports Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgical Orthopedics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Is Cervical Disc Arthroplasty Superior to Fusion for Treatment of Symptomatic Cervical Disc Disease?
