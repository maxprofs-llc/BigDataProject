A 73-year-old man was presented to hospital complaining sudden onset of chest pain. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a type A aortic dissection, that extended from the ascending aorta to the left common iliac atery. Superior mesenteric artery was compressed by the thrombosed false lumen. Epigastric pain was exacerbated acutely, we decided to treat the bowel ischemia 1st, and after that, if bowel ischemia was reversible, central repair operation performed. Emergent saphenous vein bypass was performed from the right external iliac artery to the superior mesenteric artery. Then total arch replacement was performed using cardiopulmonary bypass. The patient complicated with postoperative paralytic ileus, he completely recovered without bowel resection.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9163cf058f61000d027","first_seen_on":"2013-03-01T11:15:26+00:00","issns":["0021-5252"],"issue":"3","journal":"Kyobu geka The Japanese journal of thoracic surgery","last_mentioned_on":1388574965,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23445651?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23445651","pubdate":"2013-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"[Acute TypeA Aortic Dissection with Superior Mesenteric Arterial Dissection; Report of a Case].","type":"article","volume":"66","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/acute-type-aortic-dissection-superior-mesenteric-arterial-dissection-report-case-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634915,"mean":4.919334042571,"rank":2898763,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":81579,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634915,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85544,"mean":6.1430048046013,"rank":65253,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":425,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85544,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77,"mean":0.69602631578947,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.4375,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/statuses\/307448903538724865","license":"public","citation_ids":[1272729],"posted_on":"2013-03-01T11:15:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":439},"tweet_id":"307448903538724865"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/status\/418339841072316416","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1272729],"posted_on":"2014-01-01T11:16:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":439},"tweet_id":"418339841072316416"}]}}
