Once the symptoms are identified, rapid diagnosis and treatment will prevent further deterioration in the patient's condition. The nurse plays a critical role in this process. The specific presentation of PIP, along with clarification of potential causes and strategies to prevent the occurrence of this complication, will be discussed. Through a case study format and emphasis on the role of the nurse, the specifics of case finding and rapid intervention will be described.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a65","doi":"10.1097\/jnn.0b013e3182829054","first_seen_on":"2013-03-01T06:00:30+00:00","issns":["0888-0395"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of neuroscience nursing","last_mentioned_on":1362117618,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jnnonline\/Abstract\/2013\/04000\/Postictal_Psychosis___Implications_for_Nursing.3.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jnnonline\/2013\/04000\/Postictal_Psychosis___Implications_for_Nursing.3.pdf","pmid":"23353654","pubdate":"2013-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"71","subjects":["nursing","neurosurgery","neurology"],"title":"Postictal Psychosis: Implications for Nursing","type":"article","volume":"45","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/postictal-psychosis-implications-nursing"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3072242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":949712,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89361,"mean":6.4572666517459,"rank":59115,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":17900,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89361,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":426,"mean":1.0936470588235,"rank":202,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":426,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":0.671875,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
