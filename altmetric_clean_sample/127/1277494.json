In the present study, a freezing protocol successfully used for human tissue, was adapted for preserving ovarian tissue of domestic and non-domestic felids. Ovaries from non-domestic felid species were obtained from seven freshly euthanized and two recently deceased wild felids kept in different European Zoos. In addition, ovaries from domestic cats were obtained after ovariectomy from local veterinary clinics for methological adaptations.Ovarian cortex was dissected and uniform sized pieces of 2 mm diameter were obtained. Using a slow freezing protocol (-0.3\u00b0C per min) in 1.5 mol\/L ethylene glycol, 0.1 mol\/L sucrose, the pieces were cultured for up to 14 days both before and after cryopreservation. The integrity of primordial follicles was assessed by histology, and the impact of different protein sources (FCS or BSA) and Vitamin C was determined during two weeks of culture.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4cc3cf058f6100004b5","authors":["Caterina Wiedemann","Jennifer Zahmel","Katarina Jewgenow"],"doi":"10.1186\/1746-6148-9-37","first_seen_on":"2013-03-04T12:24:58+00:00","issns":["1746-6148"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Veterinary Research","last_mentioned_on":1500578868,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1746-6148\/9\/37\/abstract","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1746-6148\/9\/37","https:\/\/bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1746-6148-9-37"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/bmcvetres\/content\/pdf\/1746-6148-9-37.pdf","pmid":"23433001","pubdate":"2013-02-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"startpage":"37","title":"Short-term culture of ovarian cortex pieces to assess the cryopreservation outcome in wild felids for genome conservation","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/shortterm-culture-ovarian-cortex-pieces-assess-cryopreservation-outcome-wild-felids-genome-conservat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":51.35,"score_history":{"1y":40,"6m":40,"3m":40,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":51.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8248040,"mean":6.9694059574582,"rank":177437,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":8070526,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8248040,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117510,"mean":6.704948455012,"rank":2419,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":115088,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117510,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1251,"mean":2.7662864,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":1245,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1251,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":1.8317446808511,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
