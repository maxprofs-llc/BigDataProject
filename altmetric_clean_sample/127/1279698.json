Garlic (Allium sativum) has been widely used in the clinic for treatment of CVD and regulation of lipid metabolism. This study investigated the effects of a high hydrostatic pressure extract of garlic (HEG) on HDL-C level and regulation of hepatic apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) gene expression.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000086a","authors":["Lee S","Joo H","Kim CT","Kim IH","Kim Y"],"doi":"10.1186\/1476-511x-11-77","first_seen_on":"2013-03-05T11:08:32+00:00","issns":[""],"issue":"1","journal":"Lipids in Health and Disease","last_mentioned_on":1362481697,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22713542?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22713542","pubdate":"2012-06-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Lipids in Health and Disease","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Lipidology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","biochemistry"],"title":"High hydrostatic pressure extract of garlic increases the HDL-cholesterol level via up-regulation of apolipoprotein A-I gene expression in rats fed a high-fat diet.","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/high-hydrostatic-pressure-extract-garlic-increases-hdl-cholesterol-level-via-upregulation-apolipopro"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626939,"mean":4.9512885298875,"rank":2907071,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":73291,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626939,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85499,"mean":6.1812693396337,"rank":65641,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":210,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85499,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":427,"mean":3.2315774647887,"rank":339,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":427,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.6847826086957,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
