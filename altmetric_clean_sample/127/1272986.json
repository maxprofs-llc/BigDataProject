Such processes provide versatile routes not only to test structures and vehicles for scientific studies but also to high-performance, heterogeneously integrated functional systems, including those in flexible electronics, three-dimensional and\/or curvilinear optoelectronics, and bio-integrated sensing and therapeutic devices. This article summarizes recent advances in a variety of transfer printing techniques, ranging from the mechanics and materials aspects that govern their operation to engineering features of their use in systems with varying levels of complexity. A concluding section presents perspectives on opportunities for basic and applied research, and on emerging use of these methods in high throughput, industrial-scale manufacturing.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006895","authors":["Carlson, Andrew","Bowen, Audrey M.","Huang, Yonggang","Nuzzo, Ralph G.","Rogers, John A.","Carlson A","Bowen AM","Huang Y","Nuzzo RG","Rogers JA"],"doi":"10.1002\/adma.201201386","endpage":"5318","first_seen_on":"2013-03-01T13:13:12+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1521-4095","0935-9648"],"issue":"39","journal":"Advanced Materials","last_mentioned_on":1362110400,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/adma.201201386\/abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/adma.201201386"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/adma.201201386\/pdf","pmid":"22936418","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u00e2\u0080\u0090VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Engineering","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"startpage":"5284","subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"title":"Transfer Printing Techniques for Materials Assembly and Micro\/Nanodevice Fabrication","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transfer-printing-techniques-materials-assembly-micronanodevice-fabrication"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3624912,"mean":4.9388872667219,"rank":445375,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":3162377,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3624912,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85481,"mean":6.1795343472157,"rank":12301,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":72723,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85481,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2821,"mean":6.7565468085106,"rank":607,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":1959,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2821,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":13.415428571429,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":30,"Researcher":67,"Student  > Ph.
