Fifty cadavers were analysed with cranio encephalic trauma and skull base fracture or the raccoon eyes sign. Both conditions were present in 24 (48.0%) cases. The association was significantly higher in cases with a frontal basal fracture and epidural haematoma. The raccoon eyes sign is easily recognised and can be associated with basal fractures.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ade","authors":["Herbella, F A","Mudo, M","Delmonti, C","Braga, F M","Del Grande, J C"],"first_seen_on":"2013-03-01T10:14:05+00:00","issns":["0020-1383"],"issue":"10","journal":"Injury","last_mentioned_on":1393599780,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11754879","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0020-1383(01)00144-9"],"pmid":"11754879","pubdate":"2001-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"title":"\u2018Raccoon Eyes\u2019 (periorbital haematoma) as a sign of skull base fracture","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/raccoon-eyes-periorbital-haematoma-sign-skull-base-fracture"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12.13,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12.13},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":393911,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":4642684,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93559,"mean":6.643666132239,"rank":8690,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":84869,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93559,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":833,"mean":4.2700673076923,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":790,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":833,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":2.4236842105263,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":6,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":15,"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"CA":1,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"School Fees Or Head CTs: Reflections For Ethical Clinical Practice","url":"http:\/\/www.clinicalcorrelations.org\/?p=7399","citation_ids":[1272583,2230560,541692,2230561,1363350,2230562],"posted_on":"2014-02-28T15:03:00+00:00","summary":"By Steffen Haider, MD\nPeer Reviewed\nShe was a thin, 4-year old girl brought to the Accident Centre by her mother for evaluation of new-onset bruising around the eyes after being an unseatbelted passenger in a motor vehicle crash three days earlier.
