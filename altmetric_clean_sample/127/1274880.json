Although the exact prevalence of PAH in infants with CLD is unknown, infants with CLD and severe PAH have a high mortality rate. Except for oxygen supplementation, no specific interventions have been established as effective in the treatment for PAH in premature infants with CLD. Little has been proven regarding the clinical efficacy of vasodilators and concerns remain regarding adverse effects.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9123cf058f61000cc8c","doi":"10.1002\/14651858.cd009449.pub2","first_seen_on":"2013-03-02T11:11:36+00:00","issns":["1469-493X"],"journal":"Cochrane database of systematic reviews","last_mentioned_on":1362222666,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23450605?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23450605","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["healthservicesresearch","medicine"],"title":"Hydralazine in infants with persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hydralazine-infants-persistent-hypoxemic-respiratory-failure"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":3547968,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":136183,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89145,"mean":6.4315659606929,"rank":69884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":685,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89145,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7248,"mean":10.784365668553,"rank":6713,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7248,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":6.5697534246575,"rank":70,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
