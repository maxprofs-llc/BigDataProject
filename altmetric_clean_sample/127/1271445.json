Analyzing SNPs individually requires several large studies to integrate the often divergent results. In the presence of epistasis, multivariate approaches based on the linear model (including stepwise logistic regression) often have low sensitivity and generate an abundance of artifacts.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f6100084da","doi":"10.2217\/pgs.13.28","first_seen_on":"2013-02-28T21:44:17+00:00","issns":["1744-8042"],"issue":"4","journal":"Pharmacogenomics","last_mentioned_on":1362087850,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23438886"],"pmid":"23438886","pubdate":"2013-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical","pharmacology"],"title":"From single-SNP to wide-locus: genome-wide association studies identifying functionally related genes and intragenic regions in small sample studies.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/singlesnp-wide-locus-genomewide-association-studies-identifying-functionally-related-genes-intrageni"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6615617,"mean":6.1356453182895,"rank":4894374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":970750,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6615617,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100795,"mean":6.7066729964085,"rank":67240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":18813,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100795,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":512,"mean":2.9810919765166,"rank":350,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":79,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":512,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":1.9777777777778,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
