Here we use such a model, termed APPsi:tTA, to determine what phenotypes persist in mice with high amyloid burden after new production of APP\/A\u03b2 has been suppressed. We find that 12- to 13-month-old APPsi:tTA mice are impaired in cognitive tasks that assess short- and long-term memories. Acutely suppressing new APPsi\/A\u03b2 production produced highly significant improvements in performing short-term spatial memory tasks, which upon continued suppression translated to superior performance in more demanding tasks that assess long-term spatial memory and working memory. Deficits in episodic-like memory and cognitive flexibility, however, were more persistent. Arresting mutant APPsi production caused a rapid decline in the brain levels of soluble APP ectodomains, full-length APP, and APP C-terminal fragments. As expected, amyloid deposits persisted after new APP\/A\u03b2 production was inhibited, whereas, unexpectedly, we detected persistent pools of solubilizable, relatively mobile, A\u03b242. Additionally, we observed persistent levels of A\u03b2-immunoreactive entities that were of a size consistent with SDS-resistant oligomeric assemblies. Thus, in this model with significant amyloid pathology, a rapid amelioration of cognitive deficits was observed despite persistent levels of oligomeric A\u03b2 assemblies and low, but detectable solubilizable A\u03b242 peptides. These findings implicate complex relationships between accumulating A\u03b2 and activities of APP, soluble APP ectodomains, and\/or APP C-terminal fragments in mediating cognitive deficits in this model of amyloidosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e79","doi":"10.1523\/jneurosci.4251-12.2013","first_seen_on":"2013-03-01T11:17:24+00:00","issns":["1529-2401"],"issue":"9","journal":"Journal of Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1363676400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23447589?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23447589","pubdate":"2013-02-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Reversible pathologic and cognitive phenotypes in an inducible model of Alzheimer-amyloidosis.","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reversible-pathologic-cognitive-phenotypes-inducible-model-alzheimeramyloidosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627387,"mean":4.9489064262842,"rank":281097,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":3343498,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627387,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85512,"mean":6.1770468126908,"rank":8705,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":76714,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85512,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9098,"mean":6.1532784434429,"rank":1031,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":8057,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9098,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":397,"mean":7.0272121212121,"rank":71,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":324,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":397,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
