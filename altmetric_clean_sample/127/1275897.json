Detailed blood group typing of the wife, husband, and fetus, and the presence of a very long Y chromosome in the last two, indicated a 99.9% chance that the fetus was fathered by the husband and only a 0.1% chance that it was fathered by \"some other male Caucasian.\" The couple elected to continue the pregnancy. Neonatal testing verified the prenatal findings.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021ff","authors":["M S Golbus","J D Stephens","H M Cann"],"first_seen_on":"2013-03-03T04:43:40+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"1","journal":"American Journal of Human Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1362285784,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1685934\/"],"pdf_url":"\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1685934\/pdf\/ajhg00187-0090.pdf","pmid":"7189095","pubdate":"1980-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"88","title":"In utero paternity testing utilizing fetal blood obtained by midtrimester fetoscopy.","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/utero-paternity-testing-utilizing-fetal-blood-obtained-midtrimester-fetoscopy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633425,"mean":4.921826751301,"rank":2015230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":946678,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633425,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85415,"mean":6.1431705106892,"rank":43138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":27408,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85415,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2910,"mean":6.3359147473358,"rank":2348,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":370,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2910,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":16.034564102564,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/younglibrarian\/status\/308075025938927618","citation_ids":[1275897],"posted_on":"2013-03-03T04:43:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Katie Dunneback","url":"http:\/\/katied.wordpress.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/67739858\/kmdmangaavatar3_normal.jpg","description":"Librarian.
