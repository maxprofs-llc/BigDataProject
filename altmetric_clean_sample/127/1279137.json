However, the identities of nitrated proteins and their roles in hepatotoxicity are poorly understood. Thus, we aimed at studying the mechanism of APAP-induced hepatotoxicity by systematic identification and characterization of nitrated proteins in the absence or presence of an antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC). The levels of nitrated proteins markedly increased at 2h in mice exposed to a single APAP dose (350mg\/kg ip), which caused severe liver necrosis at 24h. Protein nitration and liver necrosis were minimal in mice exposed to nontoxic 3-hydroxyacetanilide or animals co-treated with APAP and NAC. Mass-spectral analysis of the affinity-purified nitrated proteins identified numerous mitochondrial and cytosolic proteins, including mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase, Mn-superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, ATP synthase, and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, involved in antioxidant defense, energy supply, or fatty acid metabolism. Immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot with anti-3-nitrotyrosine antibody confirmed that the aforementioned proteins were nitrated in APAP-exposed mice but not in NAC-cotreated mice. Consistently, NAC cotreatment significantly restored the suppressed activity of these enzymes. Thus, we demonstrate a new mechanism by which many nitrated proteins with concomitantly suppressed activity promotes APAP-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and hepatotoxicity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002911","authors":["Mohamed A.
