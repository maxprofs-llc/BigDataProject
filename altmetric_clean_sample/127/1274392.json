For these reasons, they are intensively studied by different approaches, recently including proteomics. Macrophage cells can be taken from a range of different sources, including blood monocytes and macrophages from tissues. Macrophages can also be generated by in vitro culture from blood monocytes, and cell lines derived from this lineage can be used. Similarly, many different proteomic techniques can be used, ranging from classic approaches based on 2D gel electrophoresis to more recent high-throughput gel-free techniques essentially based on mass spectrometry. Here, we review the application of such techniques to the study of monocytes\/macrophages, and summarize some results potentially relevant to two paradigmatic conditions - atherosclerosis and disorders of iron metabolism.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073d9","authors":["Annalisa Castagna"],"doi":"10.1586\/epr.12.11","first_seen_on":"2013-03-02T02:08:23+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Expert Review of Proteomics","last_mentioned_on":1362188410,"links":["http:\/\/www.expert-reviews.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1586\/epr.12.11?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed"],"pmid":"22462790","pubdate":"2012-04-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Monocyte\/macrophage proteomics: recent findings and biomedical applications.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/monocytemacrophage-proteomics-recent-findings-biomedical-applications"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630432,"mean":4.9299514944696,"rank":2741681,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":730893,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630432,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85530,"mean":6.1463611406659,"rank":59920,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":20187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85530,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127,"mean":1.5464285714286,"rank":104,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.72857142857143,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
