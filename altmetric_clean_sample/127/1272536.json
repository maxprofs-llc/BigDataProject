Along with some fishes and shrimps, nerite snails in tropical to temperate freshwater systems are examples of amphidromous animals that migrate upstream for growth and reproduction after a marine larval phase. Here I report, to my knowledge, the first example of 'hitchhiking' behaviour in the obligatory migration of animals: the nerite snail Neritina asperulata appears to travel several kilometres as minute juveniles by firmly attaching to the shells of congeneric, subadult snails in streams of Melanesian Islands, presumably to increase the success rate of migration.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c6d","authors":["Yasunori Kano"],"doi":"10.1098\/rsbl.2009.0191","first_seen_on":"2013-03-01T09:40:23+00:00","issns":["1744-9561","1744-957X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Biology Letters","last_mentioned_on":1362130805,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2781923\/"],"pmid":"19411267","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"465","subjects":["biology"],"title":"Hitchhiking behaviour in the obligatory upstream migration of amphidromous snails","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hitchhiking-behaviour-obligatory-upstream-migration-amphidromous-snails"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632582,"mean":4.9236596667819,"rank":2015228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":945694,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632582,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85531,"mean":6.1465521337543,"rank":43128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":27488,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85531,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1313,"mean":21.652144817073,"rank":1089,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":147,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1313,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":4.8357142857143,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Ph.
