This phenomenon is called mitochondrial dynamics and crucial for mitochondrial function and integrity. We performed a comprehensive analysis of mitochondrial dynamics in the pathogenic mould Aspergillus fumigatus. Phenotypic characterization of respective mutants revealed the general essentiality of mitochondrial fusion for mitochondrial genome maintenance and the mould's viability. Surprisingly, it turned out that the mitochondrial rhomboid protease Pcp1 and its processing product s-Mgm1 which are crucial for fusion in yeast are dispensable for fusion, mtDNA maintenance and viability in A. fumigatus. In contrast, mitochondrial fission mutants show drastically reduced growth and sporulation rates and increased heat susceptibility. However, reliable inheritance of mitochondria to newly formed conidia is ensured. Strikingly, mitochondrial fission mutants show a significant and growth condition-dependent increase in azole resistance. Parallel disruption of fusion in a fission mutant partially rescues growth and sporulation defects and further increases the azole resistance phenotype. Taken together, our results indicate an emerging dispensability of the mitochondrial rhomboid protease function in mitochondrial fusion, the suitability of mitochondrial fusion machinery as antifungal target and the involvement of mitochondrial fission in azole susceptibility.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f610003118","authors":["Neubauer, Michael","Zhu, Zhaojun","Penka, Mirjam","Helmschrott, Christoph","Wagener, Nikola","Wagener, Johannes"],"doi":"10.1111\/mmi.13167","first_seen_on":"2015-08-15T10:08:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1365-2958"],"journal":"Molecular Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1439659509,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26272083?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26272083","pubdate":"2015-08-15T22:01:01+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","microbiology"],"title":"Mitochondrial dynamics in the pathogenic mould Aspergillus fumigatus: therapeutic and evolutionary implications.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mitochondrial-dynamics-pathogenic-mold-aspergillus-fumigatus-therapeutic-evolutionary-implications"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5483994,"mean":6.3682819390887,"rank":4562118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5483994,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191808,"mean":9.0494607287534,"rank":153765,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191808,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2231,"mean":2.8053067264574,"rank":2008,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2231,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":2.5028064516129,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1},"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/yeast_papers\/statuses\/632493834270670850","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4399682],"posted_on":"2015-08-15T10:07:35+00:00","author":{"name":"yeast_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yeast","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/470859351591092225\/S4XxHSFa_normal.jpeg","description":"Get your fresh daily #yeast #papers from #Pubmed, #Arxiv, #BioRxiv and #PeerJ here!
