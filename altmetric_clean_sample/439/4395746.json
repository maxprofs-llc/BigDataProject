Personal GWG goals predict total GWG. Some estimates suggest only 30% of pregnant women have personal GWG goals that are congruent with Institute of Medicine GWG recommendations. The primary purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which perceived pre-pregnancy weight status, healthcare provider advice, knowledge of EADP risks, and value for healthy GWG predicted knowledge of GWG recommendations. The secondary purpose was to determine sources of GWG information among pregnant women.\nPregnant women with a confirmed singleton pregnancy completed a one-time survey in obstetric clinic waiting rooms. Logistic regression analysis was used.\n246 predominantly African American, low income, overweight\/obese women completed surveys. Average age was 25 (SD 5.3) and gestation age ranged from 7 to 40\u00a0weeks. Knowledge of pre-pregnancy weight status was the only unique predictor of GWG recommendation knowledge (B\u00a0=\u00a0.642, p\u00a0=\u00a0.03). The top three sources of GWG information were physicians, internet, and books. The least frequently reported sources of GWG information were other healthcare providers, community programs, and television.\nIn low income diverse overweight\/obese pregnant women, accurate pre-pregnancy weight status perception was the only significant unique predictor of knowledge of GWG recommendations. Physicians were the preferred source of GWG information. Clinicians should have frequent, ongoing conversations about weight status with women before, during, and after pregnancy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000798","authors":["Tracey Ledoux","Patricia Van Den Berg","Patrick Leung","Pamela D Berens"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13104-015-1306-6","first_seen_on":"2015-08-14T08:28:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1756-0500"],"journal":"BMC Research Notes","last_mentioned_on":1440434745,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1756-0500\/8\/349","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26268578"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/s13104-015-1306-6.pdf","pmid":"26268578","pubdate":"2015-08-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","biology"],"title":"Factors associated with knowledge of personal gestational weight gain recommendations.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/factors-associated-knowledge-personal-gestational-weight-gain-recommendations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5521583,"mean":6.394768364573,"rank":2743931,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2610872,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5521583,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192464,"mean":9.0181423858094,"rank":95201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":88783,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192464,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1744,"mean":4.0837142857143,"rank":768,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":901,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1744,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109,"mean":4.747537037037,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":62,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
