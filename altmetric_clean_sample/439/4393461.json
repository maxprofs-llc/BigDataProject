Citrinoviride, and T. longibrachiatum) isolated from different Siberian ecotops was studied. It was shown that these species differ in the degree of their antibacterial and antifungal activity. The chosen strain, T. citrinoviride TV4-1, exhibited high activity and a wide range of actions against the opportunistic and pathogenic fungi of the Aspergillus and Candida albicans genus; bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; and cancer cells. According to mass and I R spectrometry data and the spectrum of biological action, peptaibols are probably the most active compounds in the strain culture extracts.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9153cf058f61000ce55","authors":["Sadykova, V S","Kurakov, A V","Kuvarina, A E","Rogozhin, E A"],"first_seen_on":"2015-08-13T16:57:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0555-1099"],"issue":"3","journal":"Prikladnaia biokhimiia i mikrobiologiia","last_mentioned_on":1439484604,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26204779?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26204779","pubdate":"2015-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["microbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"[Antimicrobial Activity of Fungi Strains of Trichoderma from Middle Siberia].","type":"article","volume":"51"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5480898,"mean":6.3650870917652,"rank":4559458,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5480898,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191633,"mean":8.97623009727,"rank":153558,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191633,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101,"mean":1.01808,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.7,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/yeast_papers\/statuses\/631870346157666304","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4393461],"posted_on":"2015-08-13T16:50:04+00:00","author":{"name":"yeast_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yeast","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/470859351591092225\/S4XxHSFa_normal.jpeg","description":"Get your fresh daily #yeast #papers from #Pubmed, #Arxiv, #BioRxiv and #PeerJ here!
