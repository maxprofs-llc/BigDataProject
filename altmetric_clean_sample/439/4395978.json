The threshold of responsiveness to the noxious stimulus increased when bees were previously stimulated with isopentyl acetate, which is a main component of the alarm pheromone of the sting chamber. This effect is antagonised by previous injection of naloxone-hydrochloride (Endo Laboratories Inc.). Results suggest that in the honeybee an endogenous opioid system activated by isopentyl acetate is responsible for modulation of perception for nociceptive stimuli. The resulting stress-induced analgesia in the defender bee would reduce its probability of withdrawal thus increasing its efficiency against enemies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003325","authors":["N\u00fa\u00f1ez, J","Almeida, L","Balderrama, N","Giurfa, M"],"first_seen_on":"2015-08-14T10:05:28+00:00","issns":["0031-9384"],"issue":"1","journal":"Physiology & Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1479770211,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9402618","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9402618"],"pmid":"9402618","pubdate":"1997-12-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","physiology","behavioralsciences"],"title":"Alarm pheromone induces stress analgesia via an opioid system in the honeybee.","type":"article","volume":"63","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alarm-pheromone-induces-stress-analgesia-via-opioid-system-honeybee"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7722526,"mean":6.6240776217551,"rank":1882199,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4813523,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7722526,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227264,"mean":8.5435955610901,"rank":66907,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":156749,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227264,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2363,"mean":8.4704690939881,"rank":772,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":1114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2363,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":11.530723404255,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
