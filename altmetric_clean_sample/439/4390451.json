The current study used a cross-sectional, correlational design to investigate these same issues in Australia. The sample included 575 heterosexual participants, 184 men and 390 women. Because a literature search failed to identify an Australian measure of support for gay men, a Support for Gay Men Scale was developed by the researchers. Multiple regression analyses were used to investigate whether scores on the Brief Multidimensional Measure of Religiousness\/Spirituality and the respondents' sex predicted scores on the Support for Gay Men subscales, and the strength of these relationships. Findings reveal that this relatively young university undergraduate Australian sample indicated they strongly supported gay men.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d73cf058f610001276","authors":["Carly Copolov","Copolov, Carly","Knowles, Ann","Ann Knowles"],"doi":"10.1080\/13691058.2015.1065512","endpage":"220","first_seen_on":"2015-08-13T09:06:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1464-5351","1369-1058"],"issue":"2","journal":"Culture, Health &amp; Sexuality","last_mentioned_on":1445572493,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/eprint\/RCDDnKvSDhTd3rbvAshi\/full","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1080\/13691058.2015.1065512"],"pmid":"26265080","pubdate":"2015-08-13T22:01:02+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Sociology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cultural Studies","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"211","subjects":["socialsciences","behavioralsciences"],"title":"Support for gay men: an Australian study","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/13691058.2015.1065512","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/support-gay-men-australian-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6391435,"mean":5.9810902648762,"rank":2618489,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3629961,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6391435,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184635,"mean":9.2314536867534,"rank":82117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":96201,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184635,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":517,"mean":3.528484496124,"rank":286,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":217,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":517,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":3.475,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
