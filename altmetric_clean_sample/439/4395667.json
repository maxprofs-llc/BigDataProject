It is characterized by impaired social abilities, disordered language, isolated areas of interest, and repetitive behaviors. Evidence suggested that the neuropathology of ASD is widely distributed, involving epigenetic regulation in the brain. MiRNAs are a group of endogenous non-coding RNAs that play a critical role in neurodevelopment, neuroplasticity, and other fundamental neurobiological processes. To study miRNA profiling in Autism spectrum disorder in China, we performed miRNA microarray followed quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Here, we describe detailed methods and analysis on these microarray data which has been deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO): GSE67979.","altmetric_jid":"5216115b3cf058827c00001c","authors":["Huang, Fengzhen","Zhou, Tieqiao","Yao, Xiaoxi","Yi, Jiping","Zhou, Fei","Long, Zhe","Hou, Xuan","Wang, Chunrong","Chen, Zhao","Jiang, Hong"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.gdata.2015.08.006","first_seen_on":"2015-08-14T08:02:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["22135960","2213-5960"],"journal":"Genomics Data","last_mentioned_on":1450975593,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S2213596015001798","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26697346?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26697346?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4664689","pmid":"26697346","pubdate":"2015-12-24T11:13:40+00:00","title":"miRNA profiling in autism spectrum disorder in China.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mirna-profiling-autism-spectrum-disorder-china"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6836868,"mean":6.1882509316009,"rank":1453199,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":5372776,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6836868,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":223220,"mean":8.3757043710438,"rank":58257,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":164274,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":223220,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":433,"mean":1.5995555555556,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":400,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":433,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":1.1279411764706,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
