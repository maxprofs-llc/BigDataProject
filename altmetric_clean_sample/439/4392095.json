The principal sources of fluoride include water, some species of vegetation, certain edible marine animals, dust and industrial processes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the fluoride retention of most commonly consumed estuarine fishes among fish consuming population of Andhra Pradesh.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the amount of fluoride retention due to ten most commonly consumed estuarine fishes as a contributing factor to Fluorosis by SPADNS Spectrophotometric method. The presence and severity of dental fluorosis among fish consuming population was recorded using Community Fluorosis Index. Statistical analysis was done using MedCalc v12.2.1.0 software.\nFor Sea water fishes, the fluoride levels in bone were maximum in Indian Sardine (4.22 ppm). Amongst the river water fishes, the fluoride levels in bone were maximum in Catla (1.51 ppm). Also, the mean total fluoride concentrations of all the river fishes in skin, muscle and bone were less (0.86 ppm) as compared to the sea water fishes (2.59 ppm). It was unveiled that sea fishes accumulate relatively large amounts of Fluoride as compared to the river water fishes. The mean Community Fluorosis Index was found to be 1.06 amongst a sampled fish consuming population. Evaluation by Community Index for Dental fluorosis (CFI) suggested that fluorosis is of medium public health importance.\nIt was analysed that bone tends to accumulate more amount of fluoride followed by muscle and skin which might be due to the increased permeability and chemical trapping of fluoride inside the tissues. The amount of fluoride present in the fishes is directly related to the severity of fluorosis amongst fish consuming population, suggesting fishes as a contributing factor to fluorosis depending upon the dietary consumption.","authors":["Ganta, Shravani","Yousuf, Asif","Nagaraj, Anup","Pareek, Sonia","Sidiq, Mohsin","Singh, Kushpal","Vishnani, Preeti"],"doi":"10.7860\/jcdr\/2015\/12271.6035","first_seen_on":"2015-08-13T12:22:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2249-782X"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of clinical and diagnostic research : JCDR","last_mentioned_on":1441016607,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26266208"],"pmid":"26266208","pubdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Evaluation of Fluoride Retention Due to Most Commonly Consumed Estuarine Fishes Among Fish Consuming Population of Andhra Pradesh as a Contributing Factor to Dental Fluorosis: A Cross-Sectional Study.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-fluoride-retention-due-most-commonly-consumed-estuarine-fishes-among-fish-consuming-popul"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"GB":1,"AU":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/nyscof\/statuses\/631802897299316736","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4392095],"posted_on":"2015-08-13T12:22:03+00:00","author":{"name":"nyscof","url":"http:\/\/www.fluoridedangers.blogspot.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/855513313282740224\/etvcUYZm_normal.jpg","description":"New York State Coalition Opposed to Fluoridation, Inc.","id_on_source":"nyscof","tweeter_id":"14442406","geo":{"lt":40.7626,"ln":-73.45318,"country":"US"},"followers":624},"tweet_id":"631802897299316736"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AGAINSTFLUORIDE\/statuses\/632107412707770368","license":"gnip","rt":["nyscof"],"citation_ids":[4392095],"posted_on":"2015-08-14T08:32:05+00:00","author":{"name":"FLUORIDEFREECUMBRIA","url":"http:\/\/www.lakestay.co.uk\/fluoridefreecumbria\/index.html","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/433927224756940800\/kEC5IzLf_normal.jpeg","description":"Campaigning for safe water in Cumbria and the Lake District","id_on_source":"AGAINSTFLUORIDE","tweeter_id":"268372444","geo":{"lt":54.66209,"ln":-3.36086,"country":"GB"},"followers":163},"tweet_id":"632107412707770368"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/FluoridePoison\/statuses\/638264186355752960","license":"gnip","rt":["nyscof"],"citation_ids":[4392095],"posted_on":"2015-08-31T08:16:55+00:00","author":{"name":"Geoffrey Norman Pain","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Geoff_Pain\/contributions","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/777804484420395008\/puLeeEML_normal.jpg","description":"Ph.D. scientist ex Monash, Bristol, Cambridge, Adelaide, WA, Notre Dame  http:\/\/drgeoffpain.wordpress.com","id_on_source":"FluoridePoison","tweeter_id":"59633402","geo":{"lt":-25,"ln":135,"country":"AU"},"followers":1415},"tweet_id":"638264186355752960"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Muzzpol\/statuses\/638296031973744640","license":"gnip","rt":["nyscof"],"citation_ids":[4392095],"posted_on":"2015-08-31T10:23:27+00:00","author":{"name":"Muzzpol","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/788764529685516288\/D1FguzoL_normal.png","description":"Tweets mostly on Australian & NSW Politics,Natural Health,Transport,& Aged Care,but also tweets on any issue of interest to me.
