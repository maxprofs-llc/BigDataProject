While recent efforts have emphasized integrated care as a promising model for addressing workforce shortages in providing behavioral health services to those living in medically underserved regions, little is known on how substance use problems are addressed in rural primary care settings.\nTo examine rural-urban variations in screening and monitoring\u00a0primary care- based patients for substance use problems in a state-wide mental health integration program.\nThis was an observational study using patient registry.\nThe study included adult enrollees (n\u2009=\u200915,843) with a mental disorder from 133 participating community health clinics.\nWe measured whether a standardized substance use instrument was used to screen patients at treatment entry and to monitor symptoms at follow-up visits.\nWhile on average 73.6\u00a0% of patients were screened for substance use, follow-up on substance use problems after initial screening was low (41.4\u00a0%); clinics in small\/isolated rural settings appeared to be the lowest (13.6\u00a0%). Patients who were treated for a mental disorder or substance abuse\u00a0in the past and who showed greater psychiatric complexities were more likely to receive a screening, whereas patients of small, isolated rural clinics and those traveling longer distances to the care facility were least likely to receive follow-up monitoring for their substance use problems.\nDespite the prevalent substance misuse among patients with mental disorders, opportunities to screen this high-risk population for substance use and provide a timely follow-up for those identified as at risk remained overlooked in both rural and urban areas. Rural residents continue to bear a disproportionate burden of substance use problems, with rural-urban disparities found to be most salient in providing the continuum of services for patients with substance use problems in primary care.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c43","authors":["Ya-Fen Chan","Shou-En Lu","Bill Howe","Hendrik Tieben","Theresa Hoeft","J\u00fcrgen Un\u00fctzer"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11606-015-3488-y","first_seen_on":"2015-08-13T10:40:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1525-1497"],"journal":"JGIM: Journal of General Internal Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1439900701,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs11606-015-3488-y","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26269130"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs11606-015-3488-y.pdf","pmid":"26269130","pubdate":"2015-08-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["internalmedicine"],"title":"Screening and Follow-Up Monitoring for Substance Use in Primary Care: An Exploration of Rural-Urban Variations.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/screening-followup-monitoring-substance-primary-care-exploration-ruralurban-variations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5558092,"mean":6.324208653655,"rank":2283398,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":3185998,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5558092,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191837,"mean":8.9944160741468,"rank":74896,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":113177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191837,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2523,"mean":9.3622965900079,"rank":1235,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":1249,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2523,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107,"mean":8.6715660377358,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":62,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
