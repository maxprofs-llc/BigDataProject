HCV targets hepatic tissue, and most infected patients develop a chronic infection. Currently, studies have demonstrated an association between HCV-RNA replication and miR-122, the most abundant microRNA in the liver. Our aim was to evaluate liver and serum expression of miR-122 in patients infected with HCV genotypes 1 and 3, and to identify possible associations between miR-122 expression and lipid profiles, HCV viral load, apolipoproteins and liver enzymes. MicroRNAs were isolated from blood and liver tissue, and miR-122 expression was quantified by real-time PCR. HCV viral load was quantified by real-time PCR and HCV genotype, and serum biomarkers were obtained from medical report. The levels of miR-122 were higher in liver than those in blood from individuals infected with HCV genotypes 1 and 3 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). The tissue levels of miR-122 were higher in subjects infected with HCV genotype 3 (6.22-fold, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). A positive correlation was observed between the blood and hepatic levels of miR-122 in patients infected with HCV genotype 1 (r\u00a0=\u00a00.302, p\u00a0=\u00a00.026); in these patients, an inverse correlation was observed between serum apolipoprotein A-II (ApoA-II) levels and the blood (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.330; p\u00a0=\u00a00.014) and hepatic (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.311; p\u00a0=\u00a00.020) levels of miR-122. In patients infected with HCV genotype 3, there was a positive correlation between the hepatic miR-122 and the high-density lipoprotein-HDL (r\u00a0=\u00a00.412, p\u00a0=\u00a00.036) and insulin (r\u00a0=\u00a00.478, p\u00a0=\u00a00.044). Lipid metabolism proteins and miR-122 expression levels have different relations in HCV-3- and HCV-1-infected patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5023cf058f610003099","authors":["Ketti G.
