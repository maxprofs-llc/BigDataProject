All underwent SIJ MRI at baseline and lumbar spine radiographs at baseline and after 2 years. Inflammatory and structural lesions on SIJ MRI were scored using the SPondyloArthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) method. Spinal radiographs were scored using the Stoke AS Spinal Score (SASSS). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of spinal progression.\nAmong the 110 patients, 25 (23%) showed significant radiographic progression (change of SASSS\u22652) over 2 years. There was no change in the SASSS over 2 years according to the type of inflammatory lesion. Patients with fat metaplasia or ankyloses on baseline MRI showed a significantly higher SASSS at 2 years than those without (p<0.001). According to univariate logistic regression analysis, age at diagnosis, HLA-B27 positivity, the presence of fat metaplasia, erosion, and ankyloses on SIJ MRI, increased baseline CRP levels, and the presence of syndesmophytes at baseline were associated with spinal progression over 2 years. Multivariate analysis identified syndesmophytes and severe fat metaplasia on baseline SIJ MRI as predictive of spinal radiographic progression (OR, 14.74 and 5.66, respectively).\nInflammatory lesions in the SIJs on baseline MRI were not associated with spinal radiographic progression. However, fat metaplasia at baseline was significantly associated with spinal progression after 2 years.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Kwi Young Kang","In Je Kim","Min A Yoon","Yeon Sik Hong","Sung-Hwan Park","Ji Hyeon Ju"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0135206","first_seen_on":"2015-08-13T21:42:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"8","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1439502111,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0135206"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0135206.PDF","pmid":"26271099","pubdate":"2015-08-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Fat Metaplasia on Sacroiliac Joint Magnetic Resonance Imaging at Baseline Is Associated with Spinal Radiographic Progression in Patients with Axial Spondyloarthritis","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fat-metaplasia-sacroiliac-joint-magnetic-resonance-imaging-baseline-associated-spinal-radiographic-p"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5480898,"mean":6.3650870917652,"rank":4559456,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5480898,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191632,"mean":8.976302508467,"rank":153558,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191632,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95261,"mean":9.6370352508924,"rank":79825,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95261,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6159,"mean":8.7430363754466,"rank":5187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6159,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Psychology":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"MX":1},"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/aprendedorweb\/statuses\/631943774797701120","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4394248],"posted_on":"2015-08-13T21:41:51+00:00","author":{"name":"Alex","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/877344770355494917\/nOWNu028_normal.jpg","description":"Aprende de todo, Aprende de todos.","id_on_source":"aprendedorweb","tweeter_id":"2806836826","geo":{"lt":32.65002,"ln":-115.46107,"country":"MX"},"followers":1277},"tweet_id":"631943774797701120"}]}}
