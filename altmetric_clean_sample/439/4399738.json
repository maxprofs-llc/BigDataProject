We examined the association between deferasirox (DFX) therapy and mortality in transfusion-receiving Medicare patients.\nMDS patients from 2005 to 2008 were identified using ICD-9 codes from 100% Medicare claims. Patients receiving \u226520 blood units were observed until death or end of study. Marginal structural models were used for estimation.\n3926 patients (10.1% used DFX) were observed for a mean of 48.8 weeks. Each incremental week of DFX was associated with a significant reduction in mortality risk (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.989; 95% CI: 0.983-0.996; p = 0.001).\nDFX therapy is associated with a reduced mortality risk among older MDS patients who received a minimum transfusion threshold.","altmetric_jid":"5587ebc22a83ee287f8b4570","authors":["Zeidan, Amer M","Hendrick, Franklin","Friedmann, Erika","Baer, Maria R","Gore, Steven D","Sasane, Medha","Paley, Carole","Davidoff, Amy J"],"doi":"10.2217\/cer.15.20","endpage":"340","first_seen_on":"2015-08-15T10:12:35+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["2042-6313","2042-6305"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Comparative Effectiveness Research","last_mentioned_on":1440065600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26274794?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.futuremedicine.com\/doi\/abs\/10.2217\/cer.15.20?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pubpubmed","http:\/\/www.futuremedicine.com\/doi\/abs\/10.2217\/cer.15.20"],"pmid":"26274794","pubdate":"2015-08-15T22:00:15+00:00","startpage":"327","title":"Deferasirox therapy is associated with reduced mortality risk in a medicare population with myelodysplastic syndromes.","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/deferasirox-associated-reduced-mortality-risk-medicare-population-myelodysplastic-syndromes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6561399,"mean":6.0801636599394,"rank":2711458,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3700797,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6561399,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197271,"mean":9.1838123181428,"rank":89506,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":100915,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197271,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195,"mean":2.9148144329897,"rank":74,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.1863636363636,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/pmidcalc\/statuses\/632495028284297216","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4399738],"posted_on":"2015-08-15T10:12:20+00:00","author":{"name":"pmidCALC","url":"http:\/\/www.pmidcalc.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/532077188288221184\/tjo8N6V9_normal.png","description":"Keep up to date with the latest scoring systems that will impact your practice.We also support @evidencio_org project.
