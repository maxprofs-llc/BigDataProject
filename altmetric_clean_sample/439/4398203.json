S Trippoli discusses clinical effectiveness evidences for seasonal flu vaccines."],"citation":{"abstract":"The squalene oil-in-water emulsion MF-59 adjuvant was developed initially to enhance the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines in populations such as children and adults with known suboptimal response. Developed in the 1990s, it was initially licensed in Europe for use in seasonal influenza vaccine in the elderly. Since that time, both Avian and p2009H1N1 vaccines have also been developed. Overall, more than 30,000 individuals have participated in clinical trials of MF-59 adjuvanted vaccine and more than 160 million doses of licensed vaccine have been administered. Safety and effectiveness data from clinical trials and observation studies attest to the safety of MF-59 and to its ability to enhance the effectiveness of influenza vaccines in children and the elderly.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036ea","authors":["Black, Steven"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.vaccine.2014.11.062","first_seen_on":"2015-08-14T20:25:17+00:00","issns":["1873-2518"],"journal":"Vaccine","last_mentioned_on":1456484463,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26022564","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.vaccine.2014.11.062","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26022564#cm26022564_11401","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26022564?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26022564","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Veterinary","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Safety and effectiveness of MF-59 adjuvanted influenza vaccines in children and adults.","type":"article","volume":"33 Suppl 2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/safety-effectiveness-mf59-adjuvanted-influenza-vaccines-children-adults"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7289383,"mean":6.3680766857843,"rank":1466967,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":5813670,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7289383,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":224914,"mean":8.4550654608672,"rank":55302,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":169116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":224914,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4579,"mean":6.9209781564002,"rank":999,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":3578,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4579,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123,"mean":4.4323278688525,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
