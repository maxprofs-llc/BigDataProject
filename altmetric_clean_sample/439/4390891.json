The estimated prevalence of ectopia cordis is 5.5-7.9 per million births and it comprises 0.1% of congenital heart diseases. Ectopia cordis is associated with other congenital heart diseases and various tissue and organ disorders. Common cardiac anomalies associated with ectopia cordis include ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular diverticulum, double right ventricular outflow tract and tetralogy of Fallot. Extracardiac anomalies associated with ectopia cordis reported in the literature include omphalocele, gastrochisis, cleft lip and palate, scollosis and central nervous system malformations. Here we report a newborn with ectopia cordis who was diagnosed prenatally.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53b3cf058f6100046b2","authors":["\u00c7elik, Yal\u00e7\u0131n","Hall\u0131o\u011flu, Olgu","Basut, Nursel","Demetg\u00fcl, Hasan","Esin Kibar, A"],"doi":"10.5152\/tpa.2015.927","first_seen_on":"2015-08-13T10:07:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1306-0015"],"issue":"2","journal":"Turkish Pediatrics Archive \/ T\u00fcrk Pediatri Arsivi","last_mentioned_on":1439460427,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26265899?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26265899","pubdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"A rare case of cardiac anomaly: prenatally diagnosed ectopia cordis.","type":"article","volume":"50","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rare-case-cardiac-anomaly-prenatally-diagnosed-ectopia-cordis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5480898,"mean":6.3650870917652,"rank":4559444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5480898,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191633,"mean":8.9762303581867,"rank":153565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191633,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":0.68620689655172,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.05,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ACNPed\/statuses\/631768938859237376","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4390891],"posted_on":"2015-08-13T10:07:07+00:00","author":{"name":"ACNP","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1687251577\/logo_normal.png","description":"Asociaci\u00f3n Colombiana de Neumolog\u00eda Pedi\u00e1trica","id_on_source":"ACNPed","tweeter_id":"434250807","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":157},"tweet_id":"631768938859237376"}]}}
