They have been used successfully in improving preventative care for children and have contributed to improved adherence in a number of chronic illnesses. Despite the potential advantages, there are no standard PHHRs for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). We report the consultation process that led to the development of a CF PHHR, describe the final document, and analyze the feedback from their use at our center. We have made the CF PHHR freely available online.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9343cf058f61000deae","authors":["Francis Gilchrist","Martyn Rees","Omendra Narayan","Carly Tibbins","Warren Lenney","Siobhan Davies"],"doi":"10.2147\/prom.s86298","first_seen_on":"2015-08-14T00:04:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1179-271X"],"journal":"Patient related outcome measures","last_mentioned_on":1441377960,"links":["http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/developing-a-handheld-record-for-patients-with-cystic-fibrosis-peer-reviewed-article-PROM","http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/articles.php?article_id=23142","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26316833?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26316833","https:\/\/growkudos.com\/publications\/10.2147%252Fprom.s86298?i=1212743"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=26497","pmid":"26316833","pubdate":"2015-08-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Developing a handheld record for patients with cystic fibrosis.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/developing-handheld-record-patients-cystic-fibrosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8440126,"mean":7.0979478654558,"rank":4010753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4242141,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8440126,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231061,"mean":8.7675370206873,"rank":100966,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":121861,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231061,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73,"mean":3.22275,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":6.77,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1},"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DovePatient\/statuses\/631979527091040256","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4394485],"posted_on":"2015-08-14T00:03:55+00:00","author":{"name":"Dove Press Patient","url":"http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/browse_journals.php?pa=view&cat_id=23","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/294760240\/DoveLogoBlock-75_normal.jpg","description":"Latest articles covering all areas of patient care, published in Dove Press open access medical and scientific journals","id_on_source":"DovePatient","tweeter_id":"53258840","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":7},"tweet_id":"631979527091040256"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ACNPed\/statuses\/638654058811650048","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4394485],"posted_on":"2015-09-01T10:06:07+00:00","author":{"name":"ACNP","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1687251577\/logo_normal.png","description":"Asociaci\u00f3n Colombiana de Neumolog\u00eda Pedi\u00e1trica","id_on_source":"ACNPed","tweeter_id":"434250807","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":157},"tweet_id":"638654058811650048"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CECLibrary\/statuses\/639811656919420928","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4394485],"posted_on":"2015-09-04T14:46:00+00:00","author":{"name":"Health Library","url":"http:\/\/www.keele.ac.uk\/healthlibrary\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1509719201\/library_normal.jpg","description":"We are the Health Library for North Staffordshire.
