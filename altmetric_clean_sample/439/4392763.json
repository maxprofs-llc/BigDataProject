The purpose of this study is to define five phases of arm-rest assisted and unassisted StTS using simple instrumentation and implement this method for assessing TTA movement patterns. Twelve TTAs and 12 age-matched non-amputees performed StTS with and without arm-rest support. Symmetry of weight distribution between lower limbs was calculated for five StTS phases: Descent Initiation; Descent Deceleration; Seat-Contact; Stabilization and Sitting. TTAs demonstrated an asymmetrical weight distribution pattern and a tendency to transfer weight to the intact limb during the course of the activity. Non-amputees had relatively higher symmetry and did not exhibit substantial weight shifts during the activity. Symmetry indices were similar for assisted and unassisted sitting in both subject groups. These results highlight a need for therapeutic interventions in TTAs for reducing loading asymmetries and associated co-morbidities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d73cf058f610001232","authors":["Vibhor Agrawal","Agrawal, Vibhor","O'Toole, Christopher","Gaunaurd, Ignacio A","Gailey, Robert S"],"doi":"10.1080\/00140139.2015.1057237","first_seen_on":"2015-08-13T14:10:32+00:00","issns":["1366-5847","0014-0139"],"issue":"1","journal":"Ergonomics","last_mentioned_on":1439475004,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/00140139.2015.1057237","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/00140139.2015.1057237#abstract"],"pmid":"26043080","pubdate":"2015-07-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Design Practice And Management","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Analysis of weight distribution strategies in unilateral transtibial amputees during the stand-to-sit activity.","type":"article","volume":"59","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/analysis-weight-distribution-strategies-unilateral-transtibial-amputees-during-standtosit-activity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5480823,"mean":6.3649328451078,"rank":3856842,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":921446,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5480823,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191626,"mean":8.9764825883886,"rank":132294,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":38081,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191626,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":729,"mean":4.191793956044,"rank":542,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":729,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":4.2421052631579,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
