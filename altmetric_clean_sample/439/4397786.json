While this may be the case in some biological systems, the example of rhodopsin in retinal rods with its strictly local single-quantum mode of function shows that homogeneity in space and time cannot be a general property of G-protein-coupled systems. Recent work has now revealed many other systems where such simplicity does not prevail. Instead, a plethora of mechanisms allows much more complex patterns of receptor activation and signaling: different mechanisms of protein-protein interaction, temporal changes under non-equilibrium conditions, localized receptor activation, and localized 2nd messenger generation and degradation, all shape receptor-generated signals and permit the creation of multiple signal types. Here we review the evidence for such pleiotropic receptor signaling in space and in time.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081e7","authors":["Martin J.
