Interviews were coded and analyzed to find themes.\nFamily, nurses, and physicians of all patients indicated they had multiple contact moments during nursing home stay in which care goals and treatment decisions were discussed. Nearly all interviewees indicated that physicians took the initiative for these ACP discussions. Care goals discussed and established during nursing home stay and the terminology to describe care goals varied between facilities. Regardless of care goals and other factors, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and hospitalization were always discussed in advance with family and commonly resulted in a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) and a do-not-hospitalize (DNH) order. The timing of care planning discussions about other specific treatments or conditions and the content of treatment decisions varied. The factors that emerged from the interviews as related to ACP were general strategies that guided physicians in initiating ACP discussions, patient's condition, wishes expressed by patient or family, family's willingness, family involvement, continuity of communication, consensus with or within family, and general nursing home policy. Two influential underlying strategies guided physicians in initiating ACP discussions: (1) wait for a reason to initiate discussions, such as a change in health condition and (2) take initiative to discuss possible treatments (actively, including describing scenarios).\nACP is a multifactorial process, which may lean on professional caregivers' guidance. The most acute decisions are covered in advance, but a responsive as well as a proactive style is seen with other treatment decisions. Further research is needed to increase understanding of whether and how the physicians' strategies affect care processes and outcomes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037a9","authors":["van Soest-Poortvliet, Mirjam C","van der Steen, Jenny T","Gutschow, Giselka","Deliens, Luc","Onwuteaka-Philipsen, Bregje D","de Vet, Henrica C W","Hertogh, Cees M P M","Mirjam C. van Soest-Poortvliet","Jenny T. van der Steen","Giselka Gutschow","Luc Deliens","Bregje D.
