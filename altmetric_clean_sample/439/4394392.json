Self-reported interest in CRC screening was measured immediately before and after CCRAT use; sociodemographic characteristics and prior CRC screening history were also assessed. Multivariable analyses assessed participants' change in interest in screening, and subgroup differences in this change.\nPersonalized CRC risk information had no overall effect on CRC screening interest, but significant subgroup differences were observed. Change in screening interest was greater among individuals with recent screening (p=.015), higher model-estimated cancer risk (p=.0002), and lower baseline interest (p<.0001), with individuals at highest baseline interest demonstrating negative (not neutral) change in interest.\nEffects of quantitative personalized CRC risk information on laypersons' interest in CRC screening differ among individuals depending on prior screening history, estimated cancer risk, and baseline screening interest.\nPersonalized cancer risk information has personalized effects-increasing and decreasing screening interest in different individuals.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032a1","authors":["Han, Paul K J","Duarte, Christine W","Daggett, Susannah","Siewers, Andrea","Killam, Bill","Smith, Kahsi A","Freedman, Andrew N"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pec.2015.07.010","first_seen_on":"2015-08-13T23:18:05+00:00","funders":["niehs","phs"],"issns":["1873-5134"],"journal":"Patient Education & Counseling","last_mentioned_on":1439507870,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26227576?sf39855472=1"],"pmid":"26227576","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nursing"],"title":"Effects of personalized colorectal cancer risk information on laypersons' interest in colorectal cancer screening: The importance of individual differences.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-personalized-colorectal-cancer-risk-information-laypersons-interest-colorectal-cancer-screen-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5480898,"mean":6.3650870917652,"rank":3856935,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":921490,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5480898,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191633,"mean":8.9763313329717,"rank":132292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":38077,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191633,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1189,"mean":4.1166750841751,"rank":992,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1189,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":4.0678082191781,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
