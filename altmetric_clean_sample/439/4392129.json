The color change (\u0394E) and the amount of H2O2 that permeated the tooth tissue were analyzed using a spectrophotometer. Cell metabolism and morphology were evaluated using the methylthiazol tetrazolium assay and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. The \u0394E values and H2O2 permeation were not significantly different under any of the experimental conditions. Tooth whitening significantly reduced cell metabolism, regardless of whether a light source was used. Preconditioning the enamel did not influence the cellular metabolism in any group. In conclusion, combining the bleaching product with different light sources and\/or preconditioning the enamel resulted in few significant changes in color, transenamel and transdentinal penetration of H2O2, or cytotoxicity and cell morphology.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f91","authors":["RS CAS Costa"],"doi":"10.2341\/14-364-l","first_seen_on":"2015-08-13T12:35:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1559-2863"],"journal":"Operative Dentistry","last_mentioned_on":1439469279,"links":["http:\/\/www.jopdentonline.org\/doi\/abs\/10.2341\/14-364-L","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.2341\/14-364-L"],"pmid":"26266650","pubdate":"2015-08-13T22:00:30+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry","generalsurgery"],"title":"Effect of Different Light Sources and Enamel Preconditioning on Color Change, H2O2 Penetration, and Cytotoxicity in Bleached Teeth","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-different-light-sources-enamel-preconditioning-color-change-ho-penetration-cytotoxicity-bleac"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5480898,"mean":6.3650870917652,"rank":3628176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1624016,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5480898,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191632,"mean":8.9762714592109,"rank":123100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":59348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191632,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":441,"mean":0.95534090909091,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":441,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":0.8375,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":3}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jopdent\/statuses\/631806065521389568","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4392129],"posted_on":"2015-08-13T12:34:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Operative Dentistry","url":"http:\/\/www.jopdent.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/823982742744559620\/VEIF1dGm_normal.jpg","description":"The scope of Op Dent includes conservation and restoration of teeth; the scientific foundation of op dent therapy; dental materials; and dental education.","id_on_source":"jopdent","tweeter_id":"562929795","geo":{"lt":39.76838,"ln":-86.15804,"country":"US"},"followers":278},"tweet_id":"631806065521389568"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Effect of Different Light Sources and Enamel Preconditioning on Color Change, H2O2 Penetration,...","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1028564107167312&id=413489575341438","license":"public","citation_ids":[4392129],"posted_on":"2015-08-13T12:32:27+00:00","summary":"New Article:  http:\/\/www.jopdentonline.org\/doi\/abs\/10.2341\/14-364-L","author":{"name":"Operative Dentistry, Inc.","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/413489575341438","facebook_wall_name":"Operative Dentistry, Inc.","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/413489575341438\/picture","id_on_source":"413489575341438"}}]}}
