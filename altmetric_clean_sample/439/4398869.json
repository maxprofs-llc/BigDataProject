However, the possible mechanisms underlying increased blood pressure levels observed in this population remain unclear. Thus, we aimed to test the hypothesis that peripheral vascular resistance is increased at rest in patients with traumatic lower limb amputation.\nIn a cross-sectional study, eight patients with traumatic unilateral lower limb amputation (amputee group) and eight healthy individuals without amputation (control group) were included. Resting blood pressure, heart rate, and forearm blood flow were recorded simultaneously and thus, forearm vascular resistance was calculated.\nThe amputee group showed higher systolic (126\u00b12 vs. 118\u00b15\u2009mmHg, P<0.01), diastolic (78\u00b12 vs. 63\u00b13\u2009mmHg, P<0.01), mean blood pressure (94\u00b12 vs. 81\u00b13\u2009mmHg, P<0.01), and heart rate (74\u00b15 vs. 65\u00b18\u2009bpm, P=0.02) compared with the control group. Despite the similar forearm blood flow response between groups, patients with traumatic lower limb amputation presented increased peripheral vascular resistance at rest compared with the control group (31.3\u00b13.8 vs. 25.7\u00b16.5\u2009U, P=0.05).\nPatients with traumatic amputation present increased peripheral vascular resistance. Our findings clarify one possible mechanism underlying the higher blood pressure levels observed in this population.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005780","authors":["Paula-Ribeiro, Marcelle","Garcia, Mar\u00edlia M N","Martinez, Daniel G","Lima, Jorge R P","Laterza, Mateus C"],"doi":"10.1097\/mbp.0000000000000148","first_seen_on":"2015-08-15T02:15:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1359-5237","1473-5725"],"journal":"Blood pressure monitoring.","last_mentioned_on":1439604940,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/bpmonitoring\/9000\/00000\/Increased_peripheral_vascular_resistance_in_male.99657.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/bpmonitoring\/9000\/00000\/Increased_peripheral_vascular_resistance_in_male.99657.pdf","pmid":"26274369","pubdate":"2015-08-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"title":"Increased peripheral vascular resistance in male patients with traumatic lower limb amputation: one piece of the cardiovascular risk puzzle.","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increased-peripheral-vascular-resistance-male-patients-traumatic-lower-limb-amputation-one-piece-car"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5484049,"mean":6.3683118320617,"rank":2914865,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1864304,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5484049,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191808,"mean":9.0492792963762,"rank":104377,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":68676,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191808,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":485,"mean":1.7054297520661,"rank":156,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":485,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.9253333333333,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
