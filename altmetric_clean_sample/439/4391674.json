Quantitative 9.4T MRI was carried out (T1, T2, T2* and MTR) on 13 cortical resections, representing pathologically confirmed FCD (five cases) and normal cortex. Quantitative immunohistochemistry for myelination (myelin basic protein\/SMI94), neuronal populations (MAP2, neurofilament (SMI31, SMI32), synpatophysin, NeuN, calbindin), reactive glia (GFAP), microglia (CD68) and blood brain barrier permeability (albumin) was carried out in 43 regions of interest (ROI) from normal and abnormal white matter and cortex. MRI were spatially aligned and quantitative analysis carried out on corresponding ROI. Line profile analysis (LPA) of intensity gradients through the cortex were carried out on MRI and immunostained sections. An inverse correlation was noted between myelin\/SMI94 and T1, T2 (p<0.005) and T2* (p<0.05; Spearman's correlation) and a positive correlation between neuronal MAP2 and T1 (p<0.005) and T2* (p<0.05) over all ROI. Similar pathology-MRI correlations were observed for histologically unremarkable white matter ROI only. LPA showed altered gradient contours in regions of FCD, reflecting abnormal cortical lamination and myelo-architecture, including a pre-operatively undetectable FCD case. This study demonstrates the ability of quantitative 9.4T MRI to detect subtle differences neuronal numbers and myelination in histologically normal appearing white matter and LPA in the evaluation of cortical dyslamination. These methods may be translatable to the in vivo detection of mild cortical malformations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60f3cf058f610006ce6","authors":["Reeves, C","Tachrount, M","Thomas, DL","Michalak, Z","Liu, J","Ellis, M","Diehl, B","Miserocchi, A","McEvoy, A W","Eriksson, S","Yousry, T","Thom, M","Reeves, Cheryl","Tachrount, Mohamed","Thomas, David","Michalak, Zuzanna","Liu, Joan","Ellis, Matthew","Diehl, Beate","Miserocchi, Anna","McEvoy, Andrew W.","Eriksson, Sofia","Yousry, Tarek","Thom, Maria"],"doi":"10.1111\/bpa.12298","endpage":"333","first_seen_on":"2015-08-13T11:29:23+00:00","funders":["niehs","mrc"],"issns":["1750-3639"],"issue":"3","journal":"Brain Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1439459432,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/bpa.12298"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/bpa.12298\/pdf","pmid":"26268959","pubdate":"2015-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"319","subjects":["pathology","brain"],"title":"Combined ex\u2010vivo 9.4T MRI and quantitative histopathological study in normal and pathological neocortical resections in focal epilepsy","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/combined-ex-vivo-94t-mri-quantitative-histopathological-study-normal-pathological-neocortical-resect"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6408416,"mean":5.9860168490959,"rank":5459466,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6408416,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189638,"mean":9.1135466496517,"rank":151572,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189638,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":326,"mean":2.9280430769231,"rank":269,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":326,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":3.6426153846154,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
