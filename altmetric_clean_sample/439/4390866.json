Heat shock protein\/peptides (HSP\/Ps) are autoimmune factors that can induce both adaptive and innate immune responses; HSP\/Ps isolated from tumors can induce antitumor immune activity when used as vaccines.\nIn this study, we evaluated the effects of mHSP\/Ps on prophylactic antitumor immunity. We extracted mHSP\/Ps, including HSP60, HSP70, GP96, and HSP110, from the mouse sarcoma cell lines S180 and MCA207 using chromatography. The immunity induced by mHSP\/Ps was assessed using flow cytometry, ELISPOT, lactate dehydrogenase release, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\nOf S180 sarcoma-bearing mice immunized with mHSP\/Ps isolated from S180 cells, 41.2% showed tumor regression and long-term survival, with a tumor growth inhibition rate of 82.3% at 30 days. Of MCA207 sarcoma-bearing mice immunized with mHSP\/Ps isolated from MCA207 cells, 50% showed tumor regression and long-term survival with a tumor growth inhibition rate of 79.3%. All control mice died within 40 days. The proportions of natural killer cells, CD8+, and interferon-\u03b3-secreting cells and tumor-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity were increased in the immunized group.\nVaccination with a polyvalent mHSP\/P cancer vaccine can induce an immunological response and a marked antitumor response to autologous tumors. This mHSP\/P vaccine exerted greater antitumor effects than did HSP70, HSP60, or tumor lysates alone.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e9d","authors":["Wang, Yu","Liu, Shu-Yun","Yuan, Mei","Tang, Yu","Guo, Quan-Yi","Cui, Xue-Mei","Sui, Xiang","Peng, Jiang"],"doi":"10.4103\/0366-6999.162516","first_seen_on":"2015-08-13T10:05:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0366-6999"],"issue":"16","journal":"Chinese Medical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1456544886,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26265619?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26265619?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26265619","pubdate":"2015-08-13T22:00:50+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"Prophylactic Antitumor Effect of Mixed Heat Shock Proteins\/Peptides in Mouse Sarcoma.","type":"article","volume":"128","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prophylactic-antitumor-effect-mixed-heat-shock-proteinspeptides-mouse-sarcoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7295661,"mean":6.3692208345751,"rank":3287523,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3845148,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7295661,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":224583,"mean":8.4390709495864,"rank":96843,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":119592,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":224583,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":798,"mean":1.3969109159348,"rank":183,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":597,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":798,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":1.63,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NK_papers\/statuses\/631768419814256640","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4390866],"posted_on":"2015-08-13T10:05:03+00:00","author":{"name":"NK papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/573591369375031296\/MLLMIFLv_normal.png","description":"Paper Twitterbot for academics with an interest in NK cell biology.","id_on_source":"NK_papers","tweeter_id":"2369366659","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":224},"tweet_id":"631768419814256640"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TumorImm_papers\/statuses\/631807676561817600","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4390866],"posted_on":"2015-08-13T12:41:03+00:00","author":{"name":"TumorImmunoPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/741322452093931520\/rQvFtFTA_normal.jpg","description":"A TwitterBot for Cancer Immunology and Tolerance papers on #PubMed.
