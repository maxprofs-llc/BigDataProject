The interplay between these distinct pathological processes and the implications for TB diagnosis and disease staging are poorly understood. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) levels were previously shown to distinguish active from latent TB, as well as successfully treated Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. MMP-1 expression is also associated with active TB. In this study, we measured plasma levels of these two important biomarkers in distinct TB cohorts from India and Brazil. Patients with active TB expressed either very high levels of HO-1 and low levels of MMP-1 or the converse. Moreover, TB patients with either high HO-1 or MMP-1 levels displayed distinct clinical presentations, as well as plasma inflammatory marker profiles. In contrast, in an exploratory North American study, inversely correlated expression of HO-1 and MMP-1 was not observed in patients with other nontuberculous lung diseases. To assess possible regulatory interactions in the biosynthesis of these two enzymes at the cellular level, we studied the expression of HO-1 and MMP-1 in M. tuberculosis-infected human and murine macrophages. We found that infection of macrophages with live virulent M. tuberculosis is required for robust induction of high levels of HO-1 but not MMP-1. In addition, we observed that CO, a product of M. tuberculosis-induced HO-1 activity, inhibits MMP-1 expression by suppressing c-Jun\/AP-1 activation. These findings reveal a mechanistic link between oxidative stress and tissue remodeling that may find applicability in the clinical staging of TB patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cc7","authors":["Andrade, Bruno B","Pavan Kumar, Nathella","Amaral, Eduardo P","Riteau, Nicolas","Mayer-Barber, Katrin D","Tosh, Kevin W","Maier, Nolan","Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, Elisabete L","Kubler, Andre","Sridhar, Rathinam","Banurekha, Vaithilingam V","Jawahar, Mohideen S","Barbosa, Theolis","Manganiello, Vincent C","Moss, Joel","Fontana, Joseph R","Marciano, Beatriz E","Sampaio, Elizabeth P","Olivier, Kenneth N","Holland, Steven M","Jackson, Sharon H","Moayeri, Mahtab","Leppla, Stephen","Sereti, Irini","Barber, Daniel L","Nutman, Thomas B","Babu, Subash","Sher, Alan"],"doi":"10.4049\/jimmunol.1500942","first_seen_on":"2015-08-14T10:23:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1550-6606"],"journal":"The Journal of Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1439578803,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26268658?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26268658","pubdate":"2015-08-14T22:01:36+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Heme Oxygenase-1 Regulation of Matrix Metalloproteinase-1 Expression Underlies Distinct Disease Profiles in Tuberculosis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/heme-oxygenase1-regulation-matrix-metalloproteinase1-expression-underlies-distinct-disease-profiles"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5482709,"mean":6.3665781128594,"rank":3858210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":921654,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5482709,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192038,"mean":8.9962387144146,"rank":132583,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":38093,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192038,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6425,"mean":2.4606425902864,"rank":4693,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":1208,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6425,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":221,"mean":2.1382454545455,"rank":165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":221,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
