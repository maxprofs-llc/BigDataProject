The nanoparticles are homogeneously dispersed in the matrix with a low degree of agglomeration, as seen by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The crystallinity temperature increased ~12% when 5wt.% of TiO2 was added, showing that the nanoparticles acted as nucleating agents this trend was confirmed by optical images. The elastic modulus increased ~54% compared to neat PLA at 5wt.% of nanoparticles. Despite these improvements, PLA\/TiO2 nanocomposites showed lower shear viscosity than neat PLA, possibly reflecting degradation of the polymer due to the particles. Regarding biocidal properties, after 2h of contact the PLA\/TiO2 composites with 8wt.% TiO2 showed a reduction of Escherichia coli colonies of ~82% under no UVA irradiation compared to pure PLA. This biocidal characteristic can be increased under UVA irradiation, with nanocomposites containing 8wt.% TiO2 killing 94% of the bacteria. The PLA\/TiO2 nanocomposites with 8wt.% were also 99.99% effective against Aspergillus fumigatus under the UVA irradiation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5013cf058f610003060","authors":["Fonseca, Carmen","Ochoa, Almudena","Ulloa, Maria Teresa","Alvarez, Eduardo","Canales, Daniel","Zapata, Paula A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.msec.2015.07.069","first_seen_on":"2015-08-14T06:14:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["09284931","1873-0191"],"journal":"Materials Science & Engineering: C","last_mentioned_on":1439532820,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S092849311530254X&_version=1&md5=8a49356eb8345e411f56a93e9333cb85"],"pmid":"26354270","pubdate":"2015-09-12T22:02:45+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Poly(lactic acid)\/TiO2 nanocomposites as alternative biocidal and antifungal materials ","type":"article","volume":"57","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/polylactic-acidtioinf2inf-nanocomposites-alternative-biocidal-antifungal-materials"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5482492,"mean":6.3666389781563,"rank":3858156,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":921691,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5482492,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192037,"mean":8.9965034889291,"rank":132583,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":38101,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192037,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":385,"mean":1.2668385416667,"rank":168,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":385,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.0772727272727,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
