(April 2 issue)(1) report that beta-lactam monotherapy was noninferior to therapy with beta-lactam-macrolide or fluoroquinolone. Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix (available with the full text of the article at NEJM.org) shows that 38.7% of the patients receiving beta-lactam monotherapy also received atypical coverage during hospitalization. However, atypical pathogens were found in only 2.1% of these patients, and there was suspicion of an atypical pathogen in just 8.1% of these patients. It would be interesting to see whether the primary outcome would have been similar in the 61.3% of the patients receiving beta-lactam monotherapy .\u00a0.\u00a0.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50e3cf058f6100031c4","authors":["Nie, Wei","Li, Bing"],"doi":"10.1056\/nejmc1506892#sa4","first_seen_on":"2015-08-13T20:25:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1533-4406"],"issue":"7","journal":"New England Journal of Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1439497516,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26267640?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26267640","pubdate":"2015-08-13T22:00:11+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Antibiotics for Community-Acquired Pneumonia in Adults.","type":"article","volume":"373","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antibiotics-communityacquired-pneumonia-adults-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5480898,"mean":6.3650870917652,"rank":4559456,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5480898,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191632,"mean":8.9762730247196,"rank":153556,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191632,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15149,"mean":39.904842091365,"rank":13680,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15149,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":344,"mean":71.827166180758,"rank":263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":344,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
