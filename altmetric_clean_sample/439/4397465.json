The compound was identical to a previously tentatively identified headspace constituent of Penicillium roqueforti. Feeding experiments with (13) C-labeled mevalonolactone isotopomers demonstrated that oxidation at C12 and an isomerization of the C11\uf8feC12 to a C7\uf8feC11 double bond must occur independently and not via a C7-C11-C12 allyl radical in one step. Feeding with (11,12,13-(13) C3 )-7-epi-neopetasone resulted in labelling of the PR toxin, thus establishing this compound as a newly identified pathway intermediate.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Riclea, Ramona","Dickschat, Jeroen S."],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201506128","endpage":"12170","first_seen_on":"2015-08-14T15:38:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1521-3773"],"issue":"41","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
