Iron-containing intraocular foreign bodies may cause severe inflammatory reaction and affect visual function. Currently the optimal treatment method of ocular siderosis is a moot point. This study used the reverse iontophoresis technique to noninvasively extract iron from the rabbit anterior chamber. By slit lamp observation and histological examination, reverse iontophoresis treatment has a good effect on ocular siderosis. Reverse iontophoresis seems to be a noninvasive and promising approach to extract iron from the anterior chamber to treat ocular siderosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f610004087","authors":["Sun, Shoubin","Diao, Huijie","Zhao, Fali","Bai, Jianhai","Zhou, Yuan","Cui, Hao","Zhang, Liqiong"],"doi":"10.1155\/2015\/425438","first_seen_on":"2015-08-13T09:51:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2090-004X"],"journal":"Journal of Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1439426333,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26257921?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26257921","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Extraction of Iron from the Rabbit Anterior Chamber with Reverse Iontophoresis.","type":"article","volume":"2015","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/extraction-iron-rabbit-anterior-chamber-reverse-iontophoresis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5476876,"mean":6.3619433143891,"rank":4556188,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5476876,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191570,"mean":8.9737411794185,"rank":153497,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191570,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":436,"mean":1.3752459770115,"rank":211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":436,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.65,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Business, Management and Accounting":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/eyecenterllc\/statuses\/631625940355911680","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4390758],"posted_on":"2015-08-13T00:38:53+00:00","author":{"name":"Eye Center","url":"http:\/\/eyecenterllc.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/355341300\/apple-touch-icon_normal.png","description":"Ophthalmologists - Eye Physicians and Surgeons.
