Thirteen genes were present in the QTL region of about 1 Mb. In this study, ten birds that were inferred to be homozygous for either the high (QQ) or low (qq) QTL allele were selected for re-sequencing. After enrichment for 1 Mb around the QTL region, > 500 x coverage for the QTL region in each of the ten birds was obtained. In total 5056 SNPs were identified for which the genotypes were consistent with one of the QTL genotypes. We used custom tools to identify putative causal mutations in the mapped QTL region from these SNPs. Four non-synonymous SNPs differentiating the two QTL genotype groups were identified within four local genes (PRDX4, EIF2S3, PCYT1B and E1BTD2). While these are likely candidate SNPs to explain the QTL effect, 54 additional consensus SNPs were detected within gene-related regions (UTR regions, splicing sites CpG island and promoter regions) for the QQ birds and 71 for the qq birds. These could also play a role explaining the observed QTL effect. The results provide an important step for prioritizing among a large amount of candidate mutations and significantly contribute to the understanding of the genetic mechanisms affecting the initial post-mortem pH value of chicken muscle.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f6100074ea","authors":["Xidan Li","Xiaodong Liu","Javad Nadaf","Elisabeth Le Bihan-Duval","C\u00e9cile Berri","Ian Dunn","Richard Talbot","Dirk-Jan De Koning","Li, Xidan","Liu, Xiaodong","Nadaf, Javad","Le Bihan-Duval, Elisabeth","Berri, C\u00e9cile","Dunn, Ian","Talbot, Richard","De Koning, Dirk-Jan"],"doi":"10.1534\/g3.115.020552","endpage":"2089","first_seen_on":"2015-08-15T08:07:29+00:00","funders":["niehs","bbsrc"],"issns":["2160-1836"],"issue":"10","journal":"G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1460038389,"links":["http:\/\/www.g3journal.org\/content\/early\/2015\/08\/14\/g3.115.020552.full.pdf%20html","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26276381?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.g3journal.org\/content\/5\/10\/2085.full","http:\/\/www.g3journal.org\/content\/5\/10\/2085"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.g3journal.org\/content\/early\/2015\/08\/14\/g3.115.020552.full.pdf","pmid":"26276381","pubdate":"2015-08-16T10:07:19+00:00","publisher":"G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics","startpage":"2085","subjects":["molecularbiology","genetics"],"title":"Using Targeted Resequencing for Identification of Candidate Genes and SNPs for a QTL Affecting the pH Value of Chicken Meat","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/g3journal.org\/lookup\/doi\/10.1534\/g3.115.020552","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/using-targeted-resequencing-identification-candidate-genes-snps-qtl-affecting-ph-value-chicken-muscl"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.28,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.28},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7994779,"mean":6.7429696141599,"rank":591605,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7403310,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7994779,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228614,"mean":8.6211972809946,"rank":24101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":204512,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228614,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1201,"mean":6.6596616666667,"rank":133,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":1068,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1201,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":7.5628571428571,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":5,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":5,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
