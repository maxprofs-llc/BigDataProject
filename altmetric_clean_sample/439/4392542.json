Particularly, resveratrol was shown to have therapeutic properties in cancer, atherosclerosis and neurodegeneration. Resveratrol-induced benefits are modulated by multiple synergistic pathways that control oxidative stress, inflammation and cell death. Despite the lack of a definitive mechanism, both in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that resveratrol can induce a neuroprotective state when administered acutely or prior to experimental injury to the CNS. In this review, we discuss the neuroprotective potential of resveratrol in stroke, traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury, with a focus on the molecular pathways responsible for this protection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f610003192","authors":["Lopez, Mary","Dempsey, Robert J","Vemuganti, Raghu","Mary Lopez","Robert J Dempsey","Raghu Vemuganti"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neuint.2015.08.009","first_seen_on":"2015-08-13T13:19:24+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms"],"issns":["01970186","1872-9754"],"journal":"Neurochemistry International","last_mentioned_on":1495213229,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0197018615300371&_version=1&md5=f466e3051ab858130f66df99fede9b28","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26277384?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26277384","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4587342"],"pmid":"26277384","pubdate":"2015-08-17T12:03:51+00:00","publisher":"NIH Public Access","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"75","title":"Resveratrol Neuroprotection in Stroke and Traumatic CNS injury.","type":"article","volume":"89","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/resveratrol-neuroprotection-stroke-traumatic-cns-injury"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.25,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8229276,"mean":6.9710832737933,"rank":1329192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":6894157,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8229276,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229699,"mean":8.7084110092383,"rank":45833,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":183677,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229699,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":669,"mean":3.6375179640719,"rank":95,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":573,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":669,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":8.1711111111111,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
