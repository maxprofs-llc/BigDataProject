With this method, eleven CPs with the general formula of [Ln(HL1)L1\u00b7H(2)O](n) (Ln = Tb (1), Nd (2), Eu (3), Gd (4), La (5), Er (6), Y (7), H(2)L1 = 4-methyl salicylic acid) and [Ln(HL2)L2\u00b72MeOH](n) (Ln = Eu (8), Tb (9), Gd (10), La (11), H(2)L2 = 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid) were synthesized based on two ligands, and five of them (1-4 and 8) were characterised by X-ray single crystal diffraction. The powder X-ray diffraction patterns (PXRD) of complexes showed that 1-7 are isostructural, 8-11 are isostructural. Furthermore, 1 was characterised by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential thermal analysis (DTA), elemental analysis (EA), one and two photon luminescence were investigated in detail.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Cheng-Hui Zeng","Fu-Li Zhao","Yang-Yi Yang","Ming-Yuan Xie","Xuemei Ding","De-Jian Hou","Ng Seik Weng","Xue-Mei Ding","Seik Weng Ng"],"doi":"10.1039\/c2dt32233a","endpage":"2061","first_seen_on":"2012-11-06T09:31:21+00:00","issns":["1477-9234","1477-9226"],"issue":"6","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1358386501,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2012\/DT\/C2DT32233A","http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2013\/DT\/C2DT32233A"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2012\/dt\/c2dt32233a","pmid":"23178258","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"2052","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Unusual method for phenolic hydroxyl bridged lanthanide CPs: syntheses, characterization, one and two photon luminescence","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/unusual-method-phenolic-hydroxyl-bridged-lanthanide-cps-syntheses-characterization-one-two-photon-lu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3558374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":137096,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81561,"mean":5.4751925698873,"rank":65340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":698,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81561,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7985,"mean":0.95300375751503,"rank":4405,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7985,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1.25,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Materials Science":1,"Chemistry":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"SE":1,"ZA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/InorganicNews\/statuses\/291720247344517120","license":"public","citation_ids":[1042919],"posted_on":"2013-01-17T01:35:01+00:00","author":{"name":"Inorganic News","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1636129253\/DSC01061_2_normal.JPG","description":"News, comments and publications about Inorganic Chemistry.","id_on_source":"InorganicNews","tweeter_id":"411132501","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1288},"tweet_id":"291720247344517120"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/InorganicNews\/statuses\/265748175535624192","license":"public","citation_ids":[1042919],"posted_on":"2012-11-06T09:31:17+00:00","author":{"name":"Inorganic News","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1636129253\/DSC01061_2_normal.JPG","description":"News, comments and publications about Inorganic Chemistry.","id_on_source":"InorganicNews","tweeter_id":"411132501","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1288},"tweet_id":"265748175535624192"}]}}
