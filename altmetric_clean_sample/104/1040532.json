In previous studies in striatum-isolated nerve endings (synaptosomes), we found that vinpocetine decreased dopamine (DA) at expense of its main metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), and that 3-NPA increased DA, reactive oxygen species (ROS), DA-quinone products formation, and decreased DOPAC. Therefore, in this study, the possible effect of vinpocetine on 3-NPA-induced increase in DA, ROS, lipid peroxidation, and DA-quinone products formation in striatum synaptosomes were investigated, and compared with the effects of the antioxidant \u03b1-tocopherol. Results show that the increase in DA induced by 3-NPA was inhibited by both 25\u00a0\u03bcM vinpocetine and 50\u00a0\u03bcM \u03b1-tocopherol. Vinpocetine, as \u03b1-tocopherol, also inhibited 3-NPA-induced increase in ROS (as judged by DCF fluorescence), lipid peroxidation (as judged by TBA-RS formation), and DA-quinone products formation (as judged by the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction method). As in addition to the inhibition of complex II exerted by 3-NPA, 3-NPA increases DA-oxidation products that in turn can inhibit other sites of the respiratory chain, the drop in DA produced by vinpocetine and \u03b1-tocopherol may importantly contribute to their protective action from oxidative damage, particularly in DA-rich structures.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e72","authors":["Herrera\u2010Mundo, Nieves","Sitges, Mar\u00eda","CAROLINE BELL","JOLANE ABRAMS","DAVID NUTT"],"doi":"10.1111\/jnc.12082","endpage":"240","first_seen_on":"2012-11-05T00:38:49+00:00","issns":["1471-4159","0022-3042"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Neurochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1484746762,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jnc.12082\/abstract;jsessionid=E22C00101CC180516FDE37D9BAA9DF7A.d02t01","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/jnc.12082","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23121080","https:\/\/www.omicsonline.org\/references\/tryptophan-depletion-and-its-implications-for-psychiatry-1568222.html"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jnc.12082\/pdf","pmid":"23121080","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"OMICS International","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"233","subjects":["chemistry","neurology"],"title":"Vinpocetine and \u03b1-tocopherol prevent the increase in DA and oxidative stress induced by 3-NPA in striatum isolated nerve endings.","type":"article","volume":"124","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vinpocetine-%CE%B1tocopherol-prevent-increase-da-oxidative-stress-induced-3npa-striatum-isolated-nerve-en"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.25,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082727,"mean":6.8629605662661,"rank":1703008,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6366992,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082727,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106679,"mean":5.8712618159322,"rank":22056,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":84383,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106679,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2640,"mean":3.7951572565366,"rank":525,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":2111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2640,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":2.0432,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
