The disease caused by HEV, hepatitis E, is an important public health problem in developing countries of Asia and Africa and is also endemic in many industrialized countries, including the United States. HEV has been identified from several other animal species in addition to humans, including the pig, chicken, mongoose, deer, rabbit, ferret, bat, and fish. Here we report the complete genome sequence of the first strain of HEV from rabbits in the United States. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses revealed that the U.S. rabbit HEV is a distant member of the zoonotic genotype 3 HEV, thus raising a concern for potential zoonotic human infection. A unique 90-nucleotide insertion within the X domain of the ORF1 was identified in the rabbit HEV, and this insertion may play a role in the species tropism of HEV.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f92","doi":"10.1128\/jvi.02414-12","first_seen_on":"2012-11-04T19:03:32+00:00","funders":["niaid"],"issns":["1098-5514"],"issue":"23","journal":"Journal of Virology","last_mentioned_on":1352055803,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23118454?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23118454","pubdate":"2012-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Complete genome sequence of hepatitis e virus from rabbits in the United States.","type":"article","volume":"86","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/complete-genome-sequence-hepatitis-e-virus-rabbits-united-states"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3074964,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":952926,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82095,"mean":5.4712309791215,"rank":53284,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":16866,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82095,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5119,"mean":3.0844951152794,"rank":3595,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":1116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5119,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85,"mean":1.6845,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
