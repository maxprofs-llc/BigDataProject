As shown previously, stress perpendicular to the prior programming direction decreases the melting temperature by up to 40 K. In this study, we investigated the influence of mechanical stress parallel to prior stretching direction during programming on the stability of the elongation-stabilizing crystals. It was found that parallel stress stabilizes the crystals, which is indicated by linear increase of the trigger temperature by up to 17 K. The crystal melting temperature can be increased up to 126.5 \u00b0C under constrained conditions as shown by X-ray diffraction measurements.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f610008096","authors":["Heuwers, Benjamin","Quitmann, Dominik","Hoeher, Robin","Reinders, Frauke M.","Tiemeyer, Sebastian","Sternemann, Christian","Tolan, Metin","Katzenberg, Frank","Tiller, Joerg C."],"doi":"10.1002\/marc.201200594","endpage":"184","first_seen_on":"2012-11-06T15:04:15+00:00","issns":["1521-3927","1022-1336"],"issue":"2","journal":"Macromolecular Rapid Communications","last_mentioned_on":1352214245,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/marc.201200594\/abstract;jsessionid=D973BDE3BAE1ABDAA70F3469F0CEFD69.d01t03","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fmarc.201200594&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/marc.201200594\/pdf","pmid":"23124898","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u00e2\u0080\u0090VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"startpage":"180","subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Stress\u00e2\u0080\u0090Induced Stabilization of Crystals in Shape Memory Natural Rubber","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/stressinduced-stabilization-crystals-shape-memory-natural-rubber"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6511175,"mean":6.0312946307361,"rank":4815190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":957116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6511175,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91062,"mean":5.8073639428515,"rank":59613,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":16916,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91062,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1060,"mean":1.7617261567517,"rank":336,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":399,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1060,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":0.35,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
