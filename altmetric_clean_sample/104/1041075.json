However, as with any other research approach and method, it is easy to conduct a survey of poor quality rather than one of high quality and real value. This paper provides a checklist of good practice in the conduct and reporting of survey research. Its purpose is to assist the novice researcher to produce survey work to a high standard, meaning a standard at which the results will be regarded as credible. The paper first provides an overview of the approach and then guides the reader step-by-step through the processes of data collection, data analysis, and reporting. It is not intended to provide a manual of how to conduct a survey, but rather to identify common pitfalls and oversights to be avoided by researchers if their work is to be valid and credible.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b11","authors":["JOHN SITZIA","KATE KELLEY","BELINDA CLARK","VIVIENNE BROWN","KELLEY, KATE","CLARK, BELINDA","BROWN, VIVIENNE","SITZIA, JOHN"],"doi":"10.1093\/intqhc\/mzg031","endpage":"266","first_seen_on":"2012-11-05T11:24:46+00:00","issns":["1464-3677","1353-4505","14643677","13534505"],"issue":"3","journal":"International Journal for Quality in Health Care","last_mentioned_on":1498444800,"links":["http:\/\/intqhc.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/15\/3\/261.full","http:\/\/intqhc.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/15\/3\/261","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/intqhc\/mzg031","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/intqhc\/article\/15\/3\/261\/1856193\/Good-practice-in-the-conduct-and-reporting-of#.WLa92Avy1nA.twitter","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/intqhc\/article\/15\/3\/261\/1856193\/Good-practice-in-the-conduct-and-reporting-of?EFhJVetfgr2aBa2NgdgD&ved=0CEEQFjAIOFo&usg=AFQjCNHbVyeL2GSA8qwpm2R6OQfRluLoIQ&utm_content=buffer9afba&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/intqhc.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/15\/3\/261.full.pdf","pmid":"12803354","pubdate":"2003-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"261","subjects":["healthservicesresearch","healthservices"],"title":"Good practice in the conduct and reporting of survey research","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/intqhc\/article-lookup\/doi\/10.1093\/intqhc\/mzg031","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/good-practice-conduct-reporting-survey-research-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.05,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8425604,"mean":7.0878923279354,"rank":863932,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7560464,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8425604,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108215,"mean":5.9375267340641,"rank":11117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":97085,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108215,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":843,"mean":6.4386983372922,"rank":85,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":757,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":843,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":4.21,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":8,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":11,"Professor > Associate Professor":30,"Librarian":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":63,"Researcher":87,"Student  > Ph.
