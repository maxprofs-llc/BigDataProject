One model targets resource usage directly to assess production efficiency, while the other model incorporates financial results to assess economic efficiency. Performance analysis of these models was conducted in two stages. In stage one, we utilized data envelopment analysis to obtain the efficiency score of each hospital, while in stage two we took into account the influence of the operational environment on efficiency by regressing those scores on explanatory variables that concern the performance of hospital services. We applied these methods to evaluate 96 general hospitals in the Greek national health system. The results indicate that, although the average efficiency scores in both models have remained relatively stable compared to past assessments, internal changes in hospital performances do exist. This study provides a clear framework for policy implications to increase the overall efficiency of general hospitals.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f61000734e","authors":["Panagiotis Mitropoulos","Ioannis Mitropoulos","Aris Sissouras"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10198-012-0437-0","first_seen_on":"2012-11-06T04:44:26+00:00","issns":["1618-7598","1618-7601"],"journal":"The European Journal of Health Economics","last_mentioned_on":1382735310,"links":["http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/content\/43606l8877054k57\/?MUD=MP","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs10198-012-0437-0"],"pmid":"23111541","pubdate":"2012-11-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Economic Policy","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Health Informatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Finance & Economics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Statistics for Business\/Economics\/Mathematical Finance\/Insurance","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Statistics for Life Sciences, Medicine, Health Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Applied Economics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["publichealth","healthservices"],"title":"Managing for efficiency in health care: the case of Greek public hospitals","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/managing-efficiency-health-care-case-greek-public-hospitals"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6228985,"mean":5.9651782765876,"rank":5293554,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6228985,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89220,"mean":5.8440576334637,"rank":72504,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89220,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":469,"mean":3.1996367521368,"rank":392,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":469,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.8,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
