This has led to large phenotypic changes, so that the genomic signatures of selection may be detectable using statistical techniques. Genetic differentiation between nine distinct broiler lines was calculated using Weir and Cockerham's pairwise FST estimator for 11\u00a0003 genome-wide markers to identify regions showing evidence of differential selection across lines. Differentiation measures were averaged into overlapping sliding windows for each line, and a permutation approach was used to determine the significance of each window. A total of 51 regions were found to show significant differentiation between the lines. Several lines were consistently found to share significant regions, suggesting that the pattern of line divergence is related to selection for broiler traits. The majority of the 51 regions contain QTL relating to broiler traits, but only five of them were found to be significantly enriched for broiler QTL, including a region on chromosome 27 containing 39 broiler QTL and 114 genes. Additionally, a number of these regions have been identified by other selection mapping studies. This study has identified a large number of potential selection signatures, and further tests with higher-density marker data may narrow these regions down to individual genes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000225b","authors":["John J Stainton","Chris S Haley","Brain Charlesworth","Andreas Kranis","Kellie Watson","Pamela Wiener","Stainton JJ","Haley CS","Charlesworth B","Kranis A","Watson K","Wiener P","Stainton, John J.","Haley, Chris S.","Charlesworth, Brian","Kranis, Andreas","Watson, Kellie","Wiener, Pamela","John J.
