Using novel methods, we have isolated highly purified PIM molecules (PIM2, AcPIM2, Ac2PIM2, AcPIM6 and Ac2PIM6) from virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis to assess their potential to stimulate PBMC responses in M. bovis infected cattle. Of these molecules, 1 (AcPIM6) induced significant levels of IFN-\u03b3 in bovine PBMC. Three PIM molecules (AcPIM6, Ac2PIM2 and Ac2PIM6) were shown to drive significant proliferation in bovine PBMC. AcPIM6 was subsequently used to phenotype the proliferating cells by flow cytometry. This analysis demonstrated that AcPIM6 was predominantly recognised by CD3(+) CD335(+) NKT cells. In conclusion, we have identified PIM lipid molecules that interact with bovine lymphocyte populations and these lipids may be useful as future subunit vaccines or diagnostic reagents. Further, these data demonstrate, for the first time, lipid specific NKT activation in cattle.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006ef8","authors":["Pirson C","Engel R","Jones GJ","Holder T","Holst O","Vordermeier HM"],"doi":"10.1128\/cvi.00638-14","first_seen_on":"2014-12-19T10:27:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1556-679X"],"issue":"","journal":"Clinical and Vaccine Immunology (formerly CDLI)","last_mentioned_on":1458650026,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25499010","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1128\/CVI.00638-14","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25499010?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25499010?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25499010","pubdate":"2014-12-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Highly purified mycobacterial phosphatidylinositol mannosides drive cell mediated responses and activate NKT cells in cattle.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highly-purified-mycobacterial-phosphatidylinositol-mannosides-drive-cellmediated-responses-activate"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8102415,"mean":6.8892140789079,"rank":1751372,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":6290791,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8102415,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240657,"mean":7.7055993118809,"rank":56197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":183525,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240657,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":756,"mean":3.3607231788079,"rank":113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":637,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":756,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":8.2393333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
