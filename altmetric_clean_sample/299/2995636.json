Here, we report the discovery of a monomeric IgG1 Fc (mFc) that bound to Fc\u03b3RI with very high affinity, but not to Fc\u03b3RIIIa, in contrast to wild-type (dimeric) Fc. The binding of mFc to FcRn was the same as that of dimeric Fc. To test whether the high-affinity binding to Fc\u03b3RI can be used for targeting of toxins, a fusion protein of mFc with a 38\u00a0kDa Pseudomonas exotoxin A fragment (PE38), was generated. This fusion protein killed Fc\u03b3RI-positive macrophage-like U937 cells but not Fc\u03b3RI-negative cells, and mFc or PE38 alone had no killing activity. The lack of binding to Fc\u03b3RIIIa resulted in the absence of Fc-mediated cytotoxicity of a scFv-mFc fusion protein targeting mesothelin. The pharmacokinetics of mFc in mice was very similar to that of dimeric Fc. The mFc's unique Fc\u03b3Rs binding pattern and related functionality, combined with its small size, monovalency and the preservation of FcRn binding which results in relatively long half-life in vivo, suggests that mFc has great potential as a component of therapeutics targeting inflammation mediated by activated macrophages overexpressing Fc\u03b3RI and related diseases, including cancer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f610008091","authors":["Tianlei Ying","Yang Feng","Yanping Wang","Weizao Chen","Dimiter S Dimitrov","Ying T","Feng Y","Wang Y","Chen W","Dimitrov DS"],"doi":"10.4161\/mabs.29835","endpage":"1210","first_seen_on":"2014-12-18T12:32:39+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1942-0870","1942-0862"],"issue":"5","journal":"mAbs","last_mentioned_on":1418905914,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25517305?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25517305","pubdate":"2014-09-03T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"1201","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Monomeric IgG1 Fc molecules displaying unique Fc receptor interactions that are exploitable to treat inflammation-mediated diseases.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/monomeric-igg1-fc-molecules-displaying-unique-fc-receptor-interactions-exploitable-treat-inflammatio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4836362,"mean":5.7718181632858,"rank":2567544,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1613385,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4836362,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167362,"mean":8.1885641099183,"rank":85367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":61509,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167362,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":356,"mean":1.8553070422535,"rank":137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":158,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":356,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":4.2142222222222,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
