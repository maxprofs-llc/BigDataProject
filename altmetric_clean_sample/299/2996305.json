There is a dearth of research available on individual differences in cyber security behaviors. This study focused on the risky practice of sharing passwords. As predicted, we found that individuals who scored high on a lack of perseverance were more likely to share passwords. Contrary to our hypotheses, we found older people and individuals who score high on self-monitoring were more likely to share passwords. We speculate on the reasons behind these findings, and examine how they might be considered in future cyber security educational campaigns.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c1","authors":["WhittyMonica","Monica Whitty","James Doodson","Sadie Creese","Duncan Hodges"],"doi":"10.1089\/cyber.2014.0179","endpage":"7","first_seen_on":"2014-12-18T16:21:58+00:00","issns":["2152-2715","2152-2723"],"issue":"1","journal":"CyberPsychology, Behavior & Social Networking","last_mentioned_on":1476887698,"links":["http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1089\/cyber.2014.0179","http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/pdf\/10.1089\/cyber.2014.0179","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4291202\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4291202\/"],"pmid":"25517697","pubdate":"2014-12-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information Systems","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"3","subjects":["behavioralsciences","psychology"],"title":"Individual Differences in Cyber Security Behaviors: An Examination of Who Is Sharing Passwords.","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/individual-differences-cyber-security-behaviors-examination-sharing-passwords"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.5,"score_history":{"1y":8.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7560115,"mean":6.5270342886323,"rank":535560,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7021975,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7560115,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236277,"mean":7.5204961570368,"rank":20871,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":215305,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236277,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":684,"mean":24.16678477306,"rank":170,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":513,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":684,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":43.6028,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":3,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
