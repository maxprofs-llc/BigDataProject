Dipolar coupling measurement is based on the partial reintroduction of dipolar interactions by spinning the sample slightly off-magic-angle, while the coupling of interest for a given spin pair is isolated with a frequency-selective pulse. A cost function is used to correlate the so-derived dipolar couplings to trial crystal structures of the samples under study. This procedure allowed for the investigation of the l-alanine space group and l-histidine\u00b7HCl\u00b7H2O space group and unit-cell parameters.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f610003582","doi":"10.1016\/j.ssnmr.2014.12.003","first_seen_on":"2014-12-17T22:00:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["09262040"],"journal":"Solid State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance","last_mentioned_on":1418853594,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0926204014000812"],"pmid":"25595367","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Condensed Matter Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
