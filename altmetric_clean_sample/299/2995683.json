The goal of our study was to evaluate the effect of a multidisciplinary initiative to improve first patient in the room (FPIR) and first case on time start (FCOTS) metrics in a tertiary care setting. Materials and Methods: A multidisciplinary committee focused on first case start data collection. Reasons for both anesthesia and surgical delays were analyzed. Improvement efforts focused on the timely completion of surgical consent, a requirement of a surgical, anesthesia, and nurse team member presence at the patient's bedside by specific time, and parallel processing in the OR. Results: Over 65,100 OR cases were analyzed between 2007 and 2014. There was a statistically significant improvement in FPIR (82.80% versus 69.60%, p < .0001) and FCOTS (66.60% versus 55.90%, p < .0001). Surgical consent completion rate increased from 35% baseline to 68%-100%, depending on the surgical subspecialty. Improvements appeared sustainable several years following process implementation for both FPIR (84.60% versus 69.60%, p < .0001) and FCOTS (67.60% versus 55.90%, p < .0001). Conclusions: Our study demonstrates a successful targeted, multidisciplinary initiative to improve first case surgical starts in an academic setting. Our approach was organizational rather than punitive or rewarding on an individual basis. Strategies included establishing concrete, time-specific goals and posting them visibly, empowering individuals to fulfill them, and ensuring no compromise in patient safety. In the complex environment of academic medicine including research protocols and teaching in the ORs, our organizational approach proved sustainable over several years.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610004028","authors":["Naharika Saw","Joshua C Vacanti","Xiaoxia Liu","Monica SaRego","Hugh Flanagan","Bhavani Shankar Kodali","Richard D Urman"],"doi":"10.3109\/08941939.2014.987408","first_seen_on":"2014-12-18T12:56:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1521-0553"],"journal":"Journal of Investigative Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1455362019,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25517909?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25517909","pubdate":"2014-12-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Process Redesign to Improve First Case Surgical Starts in an Academic Institution.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/process-redesign-improve-first-case-surgical-starts-academic-institution"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7187728,"mean":6.3185455827659,"rank":5153732,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1779479,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7187728,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233807,"mean":7.4497875674706,"rank":139632,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":81208,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233807,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99,"mean":1.5292857142857,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.44285714285714,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
