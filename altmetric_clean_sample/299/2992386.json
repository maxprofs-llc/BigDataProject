A community-based platform that combines traditional drug discovery informatics with Web2.0 features in secure groups is believed to be the key to facilitating richer, instantaneous collaborations involving sensitive drug discovery data and intellectual property. Heterogeneous chemical and biological data from low-throughput or high-throughput experiments are archived, mined and then selectively shared either just securely between specifically designated colleagues or openly on the Internet in standardized formats. We will illustrate several case studies for anti-malarial research enabled by this platform, which we suggest could be easily expanded more broadly for pharmaceutical research in general.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002734","authors":["Hohman M","Gregory K","Chibale K","Smith PJ","Ekins S","Bunin B"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.drudis.2008.11.015","first_seen_on":"2014-12-17T17:26:57+00:00","issns":["13596446","1359-6446"],"issue":"5-6","journal":"Drug Discovery Today","last_mentioned_on":1430417142,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19231313","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.drudis.2008.11.015","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1359644609000294"],"pmid":"19231313","pubdate":"2009-02-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Novel web-based tools combining chemistry informatics, biology and social networks for drug discovery.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-webbased-tools-combining-chemistry-informatics-biology-social-networks-drug-discovery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":16.14,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":16.14},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8019263,"mean":6.7829620361534,"rank":496144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7523152,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8019263,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231745,"mean":7.661045248205,"rank":17685,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":214060,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231745,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":930,"mean":5.1792615715823,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":883,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":930,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":5.4890434782609,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":10,"Researcher":49,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
