We compared parts of the mitochondrial and nuclear genes of this species to investigate the level of genetic differentiation among the 14 extant populations. We also examined infection of the butterfly with the bacterium Wolbachia to clarify the bacterium's effects on the host population's genetic structure. Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA analyses revealed that haplotype composition differed significantly among most of the populations, and the fixation index F ST was positively correlated with geographic distance. In addition, we found three strains of Wolbachia, one of which was a male killer; these strains were prevalent in several populations. There was linkage between some host mitochondrial haplotypes and the three Wolbachia strains, although no significant differences were found in a comparison of host mitochondrial genetic diversity with nuclear genetic diversity in Wolbachia-infected or -uninfected populations. These genetic analyses and Wolbachia infection findings show that Z. emelina has little migratory activity and that little gene flow occurs among the current populations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000246d","authors":["Y Sakamoto","N Hirai","T Tanikawa","M Yago","M Ishii"],"doi":"10.1017\/s0007485314000819","first_seen_on":"2014-12-17T15:41:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1475-2670"],"journal":"Bulletin of Entomological Research","last_mentioned_on":1418815323,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25499047?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25499047","pubdate":"2014-12-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ecological Applications","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Population genetic structure and Wolbachia infection in an endangered butterfly, Zizina emelina (Lepidoptera, Lycaenidae), in Japan.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/population-genetic-structure-wolbachia-infection-endangered-butterfly-zizina-emelina-lepidoptera-lyc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4632462,"mean":5.4199858925924,"rank":3171368,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":878152,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4632462,"percentile":18},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146323,"mean":8.4247361435738,"rank":98429,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":31360,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146323,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272,"mean":2.1190405904059,"rank":179,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":74,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":4.5416,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/WolbachiaPapers\/status\/545177098139090945","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2991910],"posted_on":"2014-12-17T11:22:03+00:00","author":{"name":"WolbachiaPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/533377236796059649\/3RPMRJf6_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot of #Wolbachia papers in #PubMed, #arXiv and #bioRxiv.
