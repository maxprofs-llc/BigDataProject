In contrast to invasive electrochemotherapy and electrogenetherapy, using mostly needle electrodes and single high-amplitude electropulses for treatment, extremely low-frequency (ELF) pulsating electromagnetic fields (PEMF) and sinusoidal electromagnetic fields (SEMF) induce tumor cell apoptosis, inhibit angiogenesis, impede proliferation of neoplastic cells, and cause necrosis non invasively, whereas human lymphocytes are negligibly affected. Our successful results in killing cancer cells-analyzed by trypan blue staining or by flow cytometry-and of the inhibition of MX-1 tumors in mice by 15-20\u2009mT, 50\u2009Hz treatment in a solenoid coil also in the presence of bleomycin are presented in comparison to similar experimental results from the literature. In conclusion, the synergistic combinations of PEMF or SEMF with hyperthermia (41.5\u00b0C) and\/or cancerostatic agents presented in the tables for cells and mice offer a basis for further development of an adjuvant treatment for patients suffering from malignant tumors and metastases pending the near-term development of suitable solenoids of 45-60\u2009cm in diameter, producing >20\u2009mT in their cores.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5233cf058f610003bf0","authors":["Berg H","G\u00fcnther B","Hilger I","Radeva M","Traitcheva N","Wollweber L"],"doi":"10.3109\/15368371003776725","first_seen_on":"2014-12-17T06:43:29+00:00","issns":["1536-8378"],"issue":"4","journal":"Electromagnetic Biology & Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1418803285,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21062126"],"pmid":"21062126","pubdate":"2010-11-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology","physiology"],"title":"Bioelectromagnetic field effects on cancer cells and mice tumors.","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bioelectromagnetic-field-effects-cancer-cells-mice-tumors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4632462,"mean":5.4199858925924,"rank":2070639,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":2450328,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4632462,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146324,"mean":8.4246351701373,"rank":60990,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":80808,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146324,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160,"mean":4.5128805031447,"rank":71,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":86,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":6.6,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
