The procedure itself is primarily carried out in specialist surgical centres but an increasing number are being performed and followed up in district general hospitals. These patients are now filtering through general surgical and gastroenterology clinics and are frequently seen in primary care. Pouchitis, an inflammatory condition of the ileal pouch, has become the third most important form of inflammatory bowel disease. As research develops in this area, other complications are being found. The aim of this review is to provide an up-to-date, evidence-based approach to the clinical management of these patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f6100058ca","authors":["Johnson, Matthew W","Das, Partha","Dewar, David H","Forbes, Alastair","Ciclitira, Paul J","Nicholls, Richard J","Matthew W.
