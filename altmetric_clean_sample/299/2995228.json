While the location of ELT can vary, it is usually localized on the gallbladder wall or in close proximity. ELT is associated with various complications, a major complication being extrahepatic hepatocellular carcinoma. A 59-year-old female underwent elective surgery for chronic cholecystitis with stones. During laparoscopic exploration, a 2-cm-diameter ELT was detected in the anterior gallbladder wall and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. The case is presented due to the rare nature of ELT and as a reminder of ELT-related complications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"56b367f72a83eea9718b4760","authors":["Yusuf Arslan","Fatih Altintoprak","Kursat R Serin","Taner Kivilcim","Omer Yalkin","Orhan V Ozkan","Fehmi Celebi"],"doi":"10.12998\/wjcc.v2.i12.924","first_seen_on":"2014-12-18T11:12:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2307-8960"],"issue":"12","journal":"World Journal of Clinical Cases","last_mentioned_on":1488794772,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25516872?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.12998\/wjcc.v2.i12.924"],"pmcid":"PMC4266845","pmid":"25516872","pubdate":"2014-12-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Baishideng Publishing Group Inc","startpage":"924","title":"Rare entity: Ectopic liver tissue in the wall of the gallbladder - A case report.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.wjgnet.com\/2307-8960\/full\/v2\/i12\/924.htm","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rare-entity-ectopic-liver-tissue-wall-gallbladder-case-report"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12.25,"score_history":{"1y":10,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317445,"mean":7.0084957256017,"rank":694924,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7618482,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317445,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242730,"mean":7.7481520049109,"rank":24339,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":218231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242730,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85,"mean":6.7217857142857,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":78,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.9475,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/status\/545536859216953347","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2995228],"posted_on":"2014-12-18T11:11:37+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":371},"tweet_id":"545536859216953347"}],"news":[{"title":"Quand le foie ne tient pas en place","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=29801329144&p=1pl&v=1&x=LhuvUmsK1wNr4sla89JTvg","license":"public","citation_ids":[17043714,17043726,17043771,17043719,17043719,17043721,3741550,2995228,17043723,17043724,17043726,17043729,17043729,17043733,17043735,17043737,17043739,17043740,17043743,17043748,17043750,17043752,17043752,17043750,17043756,17043756,17043714,17043735,17043756,17043729,17043719,17043726,3741550,17043771,17043740,17043733,17043743,2995228,17043724,1855746,17043723,17043737],"posted_on":"2017-03-06T10:06:12+00:00","summary":"\u00a9 Wikimedia Commons Tout commence par une banale situation clinique.
