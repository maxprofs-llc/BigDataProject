This is linked to the balance between plasticity and rigidity of cells in the root apex, and thus is coordinated with the control of cell wall properties. However, mechanisms underlying such harmonization are not well understood, in particular under stressful conditions. We have recently demonstrated that RICE SALT SENSITIVE3 (RSS3), a nuclear factor that mediates restrictive expression of jasmonate-induced genes, plays an important role in root elongation under saline conditions. In this study, we report that loss-of-function of RSS3 results in changes in cell wall properties such as lignin deposition and sensitivity to a cellulose synthase inhibitor, concomitant with altered expression of genes involved in cell wall metabolism. Based on these and previous phenotypic observations of the rss3 mutant, we propose that RSS3 plays a role in the coordinated control of root elongation and cell wall plasticity in the root apex.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008547","authors":["Toda Y","Yoshida M","Hattori T","Takeda S"],"first_seen_on":"2014-12-17T15:17:22+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"11","journal":"Plant Signaling & Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1418829394,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23989667?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"23989667","pubdate":"2013-08-31T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Horticultural Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["botany"],"title":"RICE SALT SENSITIVE3 binding to bHLH and JAZ factors mediates control of cell wall plasticity in the root apex.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rice-salt-sensitive3-binding-bhlh-jaz-factors-mediates-control-cell-wall-plasticity-root-apex"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4632462,"mean":5.4199858925924,"rank":3754430,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":142724,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4632462,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146324,"mean":8.4246819843771,"rank":114964,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1567,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146324,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":521,"mean":1.2706,"rank":316,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":521,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":0.803125,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
