However, the aboveground biomass is usually harvested before winter to maintain the permanent removal of nutrients. In this work, the effects of harvest on plants' involvement in oxygen input as well as in microbial abundance and activity were investigated in detail. Three series of constructed wetlands with integrated plants (\"unharvested\"), harvested plants (\"harvested\"), and fully cleared plants (\"cleared\") were set up. Better performance was found in the unharvested units, with the radial oxygen loss (ROL) rates ranging from 0.05 to 0.59\u00a0\u03bcmol O2\/h\/plant, followed by the harvested units that had relatively lower ROL rates (0.01 to 0.52\u00a0\u03bcmol O2\/h\/plant). The cleared units had the lowest removal efficiency, which had no rhizome resources from the plants. The microbial population and activity were highest in the unharvested units, followed by the harvested and cleared units. Results showed that bacterial abundances and enhanced microbial activity were ten times higher on root surfaces compared with sands. These results indicate that late autumn harvesting of the aboveground biomass exhibited negative effects on plant ROL as well as on the microbial population and activity during the following winter.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f61000653d","authors":["Qian Wang","Huijun Xie","Jian Zhang","Shuang Liang","Huu Hao Ngo","Wenshan Guo","Chen Liu","Congcong Zhao","Hao Li","Wang Q","Xie H","Zhang J","Liang S","Ngo HH","Guo W","Liu C","Zhao C","Li H"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11356-014-3966-5","endpage":"7484","first_seen_on":"2014-12-19T11:06:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handle":"10453\/36858","handles":["10453\/36858"],"issns":["1614-7499","0944-1344"],"issue":"10","journal":"Environmental Science & Pollution Research","last_mentioned_on":1418987144,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25520204?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/s11356-014-3966-5"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs11356-014-3966-5.pdf","pmid":"25520204","pubdate":"2014-12-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Atmospheric Protection\/Air Quality Control\/Air Pollution","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ecotoxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Waste Water Technology \/ Water Pollution Control \/ Water Management \/ Aquatic Pollution","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"7476","subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Effect of plant harvesting on the performance of constructed wetlands during winter: radial oxygen loss and microbial characteristics.","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-plant-harvesting-performance-constructed-wetlands-during-winter-radial-oxygen-loss-microbial"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691823,"mean":5.4318361211662,"rank":3799717,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":145428,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691823,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":154696,"mean":8.2503540644495,"rank":121218,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1834,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":154696,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1013,"mean":2.0878932806324,"rank":610,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1013,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102,"mean":0.96811881188119,"rank":57,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
