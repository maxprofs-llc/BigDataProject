Moreover, nematodes that parasitise plants are a global problem for agriculture. As such, these nematodes place a major burden on human health, on livestock production, on the welfare of companion animals and on crop production. In the 21st century there are two major challenges posed by the wide-spread prevalence of parasitic nematodes. First, many anthelmintic drugs are losing their effectiveness because nematode strains with resistance are emerging. Second, serious concerns regarding the environmental impact of the nematicides used for crop protection have prompted legislation to remove them from use, leaving agriculture at increased risk from nematode pests. There is clearly a need for a concerted effort to address these challenges. Over the last few decades the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has provided the opportunity to use molecular genetic techniques for mode of action studies for anthelmintics and nematicides. These approaches continue to be of considerable value. Less fruitful so far, but nonetheless potentially very useful, has been the direct use of C. elegans for anthelmintic and nematicide discovery programmes. Here we provide an introduction to the use of C. elegans as a 'model' parasitic nematode, briefly review the study of nematode control using C. elegans and highlight approaches that have been of particular value with a view to facilitating wider-use of C. elegans as a platform for anthelmintic and nematicide discovery and development.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9233cf058f61000dae3","authors":["Lindy Holden-Dye","Robert J Walker"],"doi":"10.1895\/wormbook.1.143.2","first_seen_on":"2014-12-18T11:10:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1551-8507"],"journal":"WormBook the online review of C elegans biology","last_mentioned_on":1419275773,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25517625?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25517625"],"pmid":"25517625","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Anthelmintic drugs and nematicides: studies in Caenorhabditis elegans.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/anthelmintic-drugs-nematicides-studies-icaenorhabditis-elegansi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691823,"mean":5.4318361211662,"rank":1700393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2976007,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691823,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":154464,"mean":8.2594919818987,"rank":46411,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":107249,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":154464,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":2.1448275862069,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
