In this communication, we report on a photoactive, inscribable, nonwettable, and transparent surface (PAINTS), prepared by polycondensation of trichlorovinylsilane to form thin transparent reactive porous nanofilament on a solid substrate. The PAINTS shows superhydrophobicity and can be conveniently functionalized with the photoclick thiol-ene reaction. In addition, we show for the first time that the PAINTS bearing vinyl groups can be easily modified with disulfides under UV irradiation. The effect of superhydrophobicity of PAINTS on the formation of high-resolution surface patterns has been investigated. The developed reactive superhydrophobic coating can find applications for surface biofunctionalization using abundant thiol or disulfide bearing biomolecules, such as peptides, proteins, or antibodies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003145","authors":["Junsheng Li"],"doi":"10.1021\/nl5041836","first_seen_on":"2014-12-18T15:25:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1530-6984"],"journal":"Nano Letters","last_mentioned_on":1423739536,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/nl5041836"],"pmid":"25486338","pubdate":"2014-12-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Reactive Superhydrophobic Surface and Its Photo Induced Disulfide-ene and Thiol-ene (Bio)functionalization.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reactive-superhydrophobic-surface-photoinduced-disulfideene-thiolene-biofunctionalization"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4751697,"mean":5.7097393894752,"rank":2191377,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2439709,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4751697,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163051,"mean":8.2272846734133,"rank":68047,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":89888,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163051,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3117,"mean":10.742397946085,"rank":1859,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":1194,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3117,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133,"mean":10.659212121212,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":73,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
