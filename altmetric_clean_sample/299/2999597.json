Successful viral infection requires the virus to take advantage of the cellular machinery to bypass cellular defenses. Accumulated evidences show that autophagy plays a crucial role in cell-to-virus interaction. Here, we focus on how viruses subvert mitophagy to favor viral replication by mitigating innate immune responses and apoptotic signaling.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002725","authors":["Xia M","Meng G","Li M","Wei J"],"doi":"10.1089\/dna.2014.2567","first_seen_on":"2014-12-19T13:14:47+00:00","issns":["1044-5498"],"issue":"","journal":"DNA & Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1418994847,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25050805?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25050805","pubdate":"2014-07-23T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Artificial Intelligence And Image Processing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"Mitophagy in Viral Infections.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mitophagy-viral-infections"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691823,"mean":5.4318361211662,"rank":3799729,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":145434,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691823,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":154697,"mean":8.2502713192327,"rank":121215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1836,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":154697,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":496,"mean":2.5716848484848,"rank":395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":55,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":496,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":6.0041666666667,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
