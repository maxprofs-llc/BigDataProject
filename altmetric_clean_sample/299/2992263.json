Olefins could provide chemical protection against either exogenous or endogenous ozone and other ROS. BALB\/c mice pretreated by inhalation of d-limonene before an ovalbumin challenge exhibited significant attenuation of the allergic asthma symptoms. Diminution of the inflammatory process was evident by reduced levels of aldehydes, reduced counts of neutrophils in the BAL fluid and by histological tests. A surprising systemic effect was observed by decreased levels of aldehydes in the spleen, suggesting that the examination of tissues and organs that are remote from the inflammation foci could provide valuable information on the distribution of the oxidative stress and may serve as guide for targeted treatment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f2","authors":["Haim Bibi","Ofer Reany","Dan Waisman","Ehud Keinan"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bmcl.2014.11.035","first_seen_on":"2014-12-17T17:05:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1464-3405"],"journal":"Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters","last_mentioned_on":1442918046,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25499435?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25499435","pubdate":"2014-11-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"title":"Prophylactic treatment of asthma by an ozone scavenger in a mouse model.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prophylactic-treatment-asthma-ozone-scavenger-mouse-model"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6386702,"mean":5.8553449560254,"rank":5441722,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6386702,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187806,"mean":8.1338884055272,"rank":148362,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187806,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1871,"mean":2.5811112299465,"rank":1379,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1871,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":0.92789873417722,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":3,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Chemistry":3,"Social Sciences":1,"Environmental Science":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"CA":1,"DK":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/asthma_papers\/status\/545263424951709697","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2992263],"posted_on":"2014-12-17T17:05:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Asthma Papers","url":"https:\/\/github.com\/roblanf\/phypapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/439482171208646656\/OWe4b0kE_normal.jpeg","description":"RSS feed for #asthma papers in #Pubmed.
