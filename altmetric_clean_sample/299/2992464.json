Here we applied the CRISPR\/Cas system to disrupt the puromycin resistance gene in an engineered mouse embryonic stem cell line and then re-used puromycin selection in the resulting cells to establish stable reporter cell lines. With the CRISPR\/Cas system, pre-engineered sequences, such as loxP or FRT, are not required. Thus, this technique can be used to disrupt antibiotic resistance genes that cannot be removed by the Cre-loxP and Flp-FRT systems.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006ca0","authors":["Ni P","Zhang Q","Chen H","Chen L"],"doi":"10.2144\/000114160","first_seen_on":"2014-12-17T17:43:26+00:00","issns":["0736-6205"],"issue":"4","journal":"Biotechniques","last_mentioned_on":1418814213,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24724846?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24724846","pubdate":"2014-04-15T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Inactivation of an integrated antibiotic resistance gene in mammalian cells to re-enable antibiotic selection.","type":"article","volume":"56","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inactivation-integrated-antibiotic-resistance-gene-mammalian-cells-reenable-antibiotic-selection"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4754942,"mean":5.7097126946497,"rank":3979557,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4754942,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":157954,"mean":8.3079076687371,"rank":125554,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":157954,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":204,"mean":2.7515172413793,"rank":179,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":204,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.4166666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
