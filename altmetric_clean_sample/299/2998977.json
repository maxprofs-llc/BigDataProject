Asialofetuin-mediated direct ELISA of transgenic hairy root extracts was performed using polyclonal anti-rabies antibodies (Ab1) and epitope-specific peptidal anti-RGP (Ab2) antibodies which confirmed the expression of functionally viable RGP-RTB fusion protein. Direct ELISA based on asialofetuin-binding activity was used to screen crude protein extracts from five transgenic hairy root lines. Expressions of RGP-RTB fusion protein in different tomato hairy root lines varied between 1.4 and 8\u00a0\u00b5g in per gram of tissue. Immunoblotting assay of RGP-RTB fusion protein from these lines showed a protein band on monomeric size of ~84\u00a0kDa after denaturation. Tomato hairy root line H03 showed highest level of RGP-RTB protein expression (1.14\u00a0%) and was used further in bench-top bioreactor for the optimization of scale-up process to produce large quantity of recombinant protein. Partially purified RGP-RTB fusion protein was able to induce the immune response in BALB\/c mice after intra-mucosal immunization. In the present investigation, we have not only successfully scaled up the hairy root culture but also established the utility of this system to produce vaccine antigen which subsequently will reduce the total production cost for implementing rabies vaccination programs in developing nations. This study in a way aims to provide consolidated base for low-cost preparation of improved oral vaccine against rabies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081de","authors":["Ankit Singh","Subhi Srivastava","Ankita Chouksey","Bhupendra Singh Panwar","Praveen C Verma","Sribash Roy","Pradhyumna K Singh","Gauri Saxena","Rakesh Tuli"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12033-014-9829-y","first_seen_on":"2014-12-19T11:06:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1559-0305"],"journal":"Molecular Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1450528538,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25519901?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25519901","pubdate":"2014-12-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biological Techniques","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Genetics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Protein Science","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"Expression of Rabies Glycoprotein and Ricin Toxin B Chain (RGP-RTB) Fusion Protein in Tomato Hairy Roots: A Step Towards Oral Vaccination for Rabies.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expression-rabies-glycoprotein-ricin-toxin-b-chain-rgprtb-fusion-protein-tomato-hairy-roots-step-tow"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6792385,"mean":6.175626080326,"rank":5808902,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6792385,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231329,"mean":7.38536608625,"rank":182332,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231329,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":203,"mean":1.8576435643564,"rank":150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":203,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":0.71666666666667,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
