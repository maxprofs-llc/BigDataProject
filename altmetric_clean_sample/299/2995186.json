The structures of the new saponins were elucidated as 26-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside-3\u03b2,26-dihydroxy-(25R)-5\u03b1-furostan-22-methoxyl-6-one-3-O-\u03b1-L-arabinopyranosyl-(1\u21926)-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (1), 26-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside-3\u03b2,26-dihydroxy-(25R)-5\u03b1-furostan-22-methoxyl-6-one (2), 26-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside-3\u03b2,26-dihydroxy-(25R)-5\u03b1-furostan-20(22)-en-6-one (3), 26-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside-3\u03b2,23,26-trihydroxy-(23R, 25R)-5\u03b1-furostan-20(22)-en-6-one (4) on the basis of spectroscopic analysis. The isolated saponins were evaluated for cytotoxic activity against two human cancer cell lines including Hela (cervical carcinoma) and SMMC-7221 (hepatocellular carcinoma). Compounds 1 and 7 demonstrated cytotoxicity against the tested cell lines.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422e","authors":["Jing Xu","Shixiu Feng","Qi Wang","Yingli Cao","Miao Sun","Cunli Zhang"],"doi":"10.3390\/molecules191220975","first_seen_on":"2014-12-18T11:07:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1420-3049"],"issue":"12","journal":"Molecules","last_mentioned_on":1441107917,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25517339?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25517339","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Four New Furostanol Saponins from the Rhizomes and Roots of Smilax scobinicaulis and Their Cytotoxicity.","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/four-new-furostanol-saponins-rhizomes-roots-smilax-scobinicaulis-cytotoxicity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5579210,"mean":6.3901891271699,"rank":4647265,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5579210,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192382,"mean":8.088962028475,"rank":151844,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192382,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2476,"mean":1.8820274747475,"rank":1427,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2476,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":2.8869195402299,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Computer Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/RootPapers\/status\/545535841238384640","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2995186],"posted_on":"2014-12-18T11:07:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Root Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/447736797422813184\/Q7OqMgVA_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Plant Root papers in #PubMed, #arXiv, #Bioarxiv and #PeerJ Preprints.
