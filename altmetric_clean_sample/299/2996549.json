We analyzed baseline data from the Team Up for Healthy Living study in 2012. Overall, 19.8% of the sample was overweight, and 26.6% was obese. Boys had higher rates of overweight\/obesity than girls (50.5% vs 42.3%). Being male (odds ratio [OR] = 1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.39-2.29), having a mother with a high school education or less (OR = 1.39; 95% CI, 1.05-1.83), or having a father with a high school education or less (OR = 1.57; 95% CI, 1.17-2.09) was associated with a higher prevalence of obesity and a higher body mass index z score (\u03b2 = 0.131, 0.160, and 0.043, respectively, P < .05). Parental education could be used to identify adolescents with a higher likelihood of obesity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f6100085b9","authors":["Liang Wang"],"doi":"10.5888\/pcd11.140348","first_seen_on":"2014-12-18T17:34:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1545-1151"],"journal":"Preventing Chronic Disease: Public Health Research, Practice and Policy","last_mentioned_on":1420670296,"links":["http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/pcd\/issues\/2014\/14_0348.htm?s_cid=pcd9e222_x","http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/pcd\/issues\/2014\/14_0348.htm"],"pmid":"25523353","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Prevalence of and Risk Factors for Adolescent Obesity in Southern Appalachia, 2012","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-risk-factors-adolescent-obesity-southern-appalachia-2012-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036026,"mean":5.9656490211997,"rank":1927341,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3067705,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036026,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177047,"mean":8.1184948431482,"rank":56107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":119327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177047,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":816,"mean":15.617899386503,"rank":440,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":359,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":816,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":18.3422,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":5},"by_discipline":{"Materials Science":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Social Sciences":4,"Sports and Recreations":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NamasteATL\/status\/552840413032480770","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2996549],"posted_on":"2015-01-07T14:53:20+00:00","author":{"name":"Eleanor Fleming","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2376846970\/image_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"NamasteATL","tweeter_id":"356502321","followers":313},"tweet_id":"552840413032480770"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ObesityNewsNow\/status\/545969213127417858","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2996549],"posted_on":"2014-12-19T15:49:38+00:00","author":{"name":"Obesity News","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_2_normal.png","id_on_source":"ObesityNewsNow","tweeter_id":"66165059","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":3955},"tweet_id":"545969213127417858"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/givehomecare\/status\/545632754050686976","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2996549],"posted_on":"2014-12-18T17:32:40+00:00","author":{"name":"give incorporated","url":"http:\/\/www.giveincorporated.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/761029189457711104\/43uT3deC_normal.jpg","description":"A home care company.
