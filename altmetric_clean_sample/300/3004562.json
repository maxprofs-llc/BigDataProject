While various modes of treatments have been used to treat the hypotension of CCB overdose, this is the first report to our knowledge of the successful use of vasopressin in this clinical setting.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5213cf058f610003aa4","authors":["Kanagarajan K","Marraffa JM","Bouchard NC","Krishnan P","Hoffman RS","Stork CM"],"first_seen_on":"2014-12-21T16:26:14+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"1","journal":"Clinical Toxicology (15563650)","last_mentioned_on":1419179123,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17357383"],"pmid":"17357383","pubdate":"2007-03-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"The use of vasopressin in the setting of recalcitrant hypotension due to calcium channel blocker overdose.","type":"article","volume":"45","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vasopressin-setting-recalcitrant-hypotension-due-calcium-channel-blocker-overdose"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036026,"mean":5.9656490211997,"rank":4197817,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036026,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178004,"mean":8.0931388796819,"rank":141078,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178004,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":842,"mean":5.965046373365,"rank":819,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":842,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":4.59375,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bionavist\/status\/546702986173370368","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3004562],"posted_on":"2014-12-21T16:25:23+00:00","author":{"name":"Berkeley Bot","url":"http:\/\/markfarrell.ca\/creal","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/530906132680695808\/WJYpLqU8_normal.png","description":"Beep!
