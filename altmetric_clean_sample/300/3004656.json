Because of the scattered nature of these microganglia, lesions of this nerve pathway in birds have not been attempted, making interpretation of the functional contribution of this parasympathetic input to the avian eye uncertain. The purpose of this study was to find an extraorbital approach to the preganglionic part of cranial nerve VII and to reveal its peripheral terminals and its site of origin in the brain stem.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007a79","authors":["Schr\u00f6dl F","Brehmer A","Neuhuber WL","Nickla D"],"doi":"10.1167\/iovs.05-1279","first_seen_on":"2014-12-21T17:50:28+00:00","issns":["1552-5783"],"issue":"8","journal":"Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science","last_mentioned_on":1419184221,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16877385"],"pmid":"16877385","pubdate":"2006-01-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"The autonomic facial nerve pathway in birds: a tracing study in chickens.","type":"article","volume":"47","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/autonomic-facial-nerve-pathway-birds-tracing-study-chickens"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4751841,"mean":5.7092929728315,"rank":3977584,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4751841,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164234,"mean":8.1905966888508,"rank":130439,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164234,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2020,"mean":2.2375928677563,"rank":1582,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2020,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120,"mean":1.9205882352941,"rank":74,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
