Light is thought to be absorbed by mitochondrial chromophores leading to an increase in adenosine triphosphate (ATP), reactive oxygen species and\/or cyclic AMP production and consequent gene transcription via activation of transcription factors. However, despite many reports about the positive effects of LLLT in arthritis and in medicine in general, its use remains controversial. For all indications (including arthritis) the optimum optical parameters have been difficult to establish and so far are unknown.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007fef","authors":["Castano, Ana P.","Dai, Tianhong","Yaroslavsky, Ilya","Cohen, Richard","Apruzzese, William A.","Smotrich, Michael H.","Hamblin, Michael R."],"doi":"10.1002\/lsm.20516","endpage":"550","first_seen_on":"2014-12-20T16:09:50+00:00","issns":["1096-9101","0196-8092","10969101"],"issue":"6","journal":"Lasers in Surgery and Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1419091704,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/lsm.20516\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/lsm.20516\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC2935792","pmid":"17659584","pubdate":"2007-07-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"543","subjects":["medicine","generalsurgery"],"title":"Low\u2010level laser therapy for zymosan\u2010induced arthritis in rats: Importance of illumination time","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lowlevel-laser-therapy-zymosaninduced-arthritis-rats-importance-illumination-time"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6330725,"mean":5.9768190153299,"rank":5388736,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6330725,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":199346,"mean":7.876440241792,"rank":156447,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":199346,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":312,"mean":4.5276270096463,"rank":258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":312,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.7769230769231,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
