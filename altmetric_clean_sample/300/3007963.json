This randomized trial investigated the effect of combined individual dietary counseling (IDC) with individualized swallowing therapy (intervention) compared to IDC (control) on normalcy of food intake (NFI). Methods: Patients with stage II-IV head and neck cancer treated with postoperative (chemo)radiation were randomly assigned. NFI, dysphagia severity, social eating, and nutritional status were measured at the start of treatment and in weeks 6, 10, 18 and 30. Results: One hundred-twenty patients, 60 in each group, were recruited. No overall estimated difference was detected for NFI, dysphagia severity, social eating, or nutritional status. At week 10, the intervention group slightly improved dysphagia recovery 0.6 (95% CI: 0.1 to 1.1). This difference diminished by week 30. Conclusions: Adding individualized swallowing therapy to individual dietary counseling did not improve normalcy of food intake but slightly accelerate swallowing recovery.
