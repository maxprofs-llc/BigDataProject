MeSa has been shown to attract predatory insects of herbivores and repel pests. The molecules and neurons underlying animal's response to MeSa are not known. Here we found that the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans exhibits a strong avoidance response to MeSa, which requires the activities of two closely related neuropeptide receptors NPR-1 and NPR-2. Molecular analyses suggest that NPR-1 expressed in the RMG inter\/motor neurons is required for the MeSa avoidance. An NPR-1 ligand FLP-18 is also required. Using a rescuing npr-2 promoter to drive a GFP transgene, we identified that NPR-2 is expressed in multiple sensory and inter neurons. Genetic rescue experiments suggest that NPR-2 expressed in the AIZ interneurons is required for the MeSa avoidance. We also provide evidence that the AWB sensory neurons might act upstream of RMGs and AIZs to detect MeSa. Our results suggest that NPR-2 has an important role in regulating animal's behavior and that NPR-1 and NPR-2 act on distinct interneurons to affect C. elegans avoidance response to MeSa.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002942","authors":["Jintao Luo","Zhaofa Xu","Zhiping Tan","Zhuohua Zhang","Long Ma"],"doi":"10.1534\/genetics.114.172239","first_seen_on":"2014-12-21T11:03:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1943-2631"],"journal":"Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1444503486,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25527285?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25527285","http:\/\/www.genetics.org\/lookup\/volpage\/199\/523"],"pmid":"25527285","pubdate":"2014-12-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Neuropeptide Receptors NPR-1 and NPR-2 Regulate Caenorhabditis elegans Avoidance Response to the Plant Stress Hormone Methyl Salicylate","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neuropeptide-receptors-npr1-npr2-regulate-caenorhabditis-elegans-avoidance-response-plant-stress-hor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.83,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.83},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6240950,"mean":5.9590492029356,"rank":520693,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":5720092,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6240950,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191835,"mean":8.0201846909309,"rank":22111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":169724,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191835,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2975,"mean":7.3582562205783,"rank":419,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":2555,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2975,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":13.153836734694,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
