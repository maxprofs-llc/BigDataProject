Here we show that NFAT targets MAPKs, p300, and histone deacetylases (HDACs) to gene promoters to differentially regulate insulin and TNF-\u03b1 genes. NFAT and ERK associated with the insulin gene promoter in response to GLP-1, while NFAT formed complexes with p38 and JNK upon promoters of the TNF-\u03b1 gene in response to IL-1\u03b2. Translocation of NFAT and MAPKs to gene promoters was calcineurin\/NFAT-dependent, and complex stability required MAPK activity. Knocking down NFATc2 expression, eliminating NFAT DNA binding sites, or interfering with NFAT nuclear import prevented association of MAPKs with gene promoters. Inhibiting p38 and JNK activity increased NFAT-ERK association with promoters, which repressed TNF-\u03b1 and enhanced insulin gene expression. Moreover, inhibiting p38 and JNK induced a switch from NFAT-p38\/JNK-p300 to NFAT-ERK-HDAC3 complex formation upon the TNF-\u03b1 promoter, which resulted in gene repression. HAT\/HDAC exchange was reversed on the insulin gene by p38\/JNK inhibition in the presence of GLP-1, which enhanced gene expression. Overall, these data indicate that NFAT directs signaling enzymes to gene promoters in islets, which contribute to protein-DNA complex stability and promoter regulation. Furthermore, the data suggest that TNF-\u03b1 can be repressed and insulin production can be enhanced by selectively targeting signaling components of NFAT-MAPK transcriptional\/signaling complex formation in pancreatic \u03b2 cells. These findings have therapeutic potential for suppressing islet inflammation while preserving islet function in diabetes and islet transplantation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081e5","authors":["Lawrence MC","Borenstein-Auerbach N","McGlynn K","Kunnathodi F","Shahbazov R","Syed I","Kanak M","Takita M","Levy MF","Naziruddin B"],"doi":"10.1210\/me.2014-1066","first_seen_on":"2014-12-22T15:36:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0888-8809"],"issue":"","journal":"Molecular Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1419262552,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25496032"],"pmid":"25496032","pubdate":"2014-12-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","endocrinology"],"title":"NFAT Targets Signaling Molecules to Gene Promoters in Pancreatic \u03b2 Cells.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nfat-targets-signaling-molecules-gene-promoters-pancreatic-%CE%B2cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4751841,"mean":5.7092929728315,"rank":3366563,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":774351,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4751841,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163921,"mean":8.2200514153248,"rank":111677,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":33622,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163921,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":921,"mean":2.5674434782609,"rank":760,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":87,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":921,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":0.93333333333333,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
