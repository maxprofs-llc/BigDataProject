Multiple data sources show that benzodiazepines, prescribed for comorbid insomnia, anxiety, and mood disorders, heighten the risk of respiratory depression and other adverse outcomes when combined with opioid therapy. Evidence is presented for hazards associated with coadministration of opioids and benzodiazepines and the need for caution when initiating opioid therapy for chronic pain. Clinical recommendations follow, as drawn from 2 previously published literature reviews, one of which proffers 8 principles for safer opioid prescribing; the other review presents risks associated with benzodiazepines, suggests alternatives for co-prescribing benzodiazepines and opioids, and outlines recommendations regarding co-prescribing if alternative therapies are ineffective.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005c40","authors":["Lynn R Webster","Gary M Reisfield","Nabarun Dasgupta"],"first_seen_on":"2014-12-21T15:56:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1941-9260"],"journal":"Postgraduate Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1419207005,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25526233?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25526233","pubdate":"2014-12-15T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Eight principles for safer opioid prescribing and cautions with benzodiazepines.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/eight-principles-safer-opioid-prescribing"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691600,"mean":5.434115338552,"rank":3034967,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1480984,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691600,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155461,"mean":8.2503530425834,"rank":97553,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":51250,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155461,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":375,"mean":2.6327058823529,"rank":234,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":130,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":375,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":3.3972142857143,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
