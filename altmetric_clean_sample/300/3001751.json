However, less is known about the interrelationships of common variants in the CYP19A1 gene, daily levels of oestrogens, mammographic density phenotypes, and body mass index (BMI) in premenopausal women.MethodsBased on plausible biological mechanisms related to the oestrogen pathway, we investigated the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CYP19A1, 17\u00df-estradiol and mammographic density in 202 premenopausal women. DNA was genotyped using the Illumina Golden Gate platform. Daily salivary 17\u00df-estradiol concentrations were measured throughout an entire menstrual cycle. Mammographic density phenotypes were assessed using a computer-assisted method (Madena). We determined associations using multivariable linear and logistic regression models.ResultsThe minor alleles of rs749292 were positively (P\u00bf=\u00bf0.026), and the minor alleles of rs7172156 were inversely (P\u00bf=\u00bf0.002) associated with daily 17\u00df-estradiol. We observed an 87% lower level of daily 17\u00df-estradiol throughout a menstrual cycle in heavier women (BMI >23.6\u00a0kg\/m2) of rs7172156 with minor genotype aa compared with major genotype AA. Furthermore, the rs749292 minor alleles were inversely associated with absolute mammographic density (P\u00bf=\u00bf0.032). Lean women with rs749292 minor alleles had 70 to 80% lower risk for high absolute mammographic density (>32.4\u00a0cm2); Aa: odds ratio (OR)\u00bf=\u00bf0.23 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.75). Lean women with rs7172156 minor homozygous genotype had OR 5.45 for high absolute mammographic density (aa: OR\u00bf=\u00bf5.45 (95% CI 1.13 to 26.3)).ConclusionOur findings suggest that two SNPs in CYP19A1, rs749292 and rs7172156, are associated with both daily oestrogen levels and mammographic density phenotypes. Body mass index may modify these associations, but larger studies are needed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007eb","authors":["Vidar G Flote","Anne-Sofie Furberg","Anne McTiernan","Hanne Frydenberg","Giske Ursin","Anita Iversen","Trygve Lofteroed","Peter T Ellison","Erik A Wist","Thore Egeland","Tom Wilsgaard","Karen W Makar","Jenny Chang-Claude","Inger Thune"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13058-014-0499-2","first_seen_on":"2014-12-20T04:42:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1465-5411","1465-542X"],"issue":"6","journal":"Breast Cancer Research","last_mentioned_on":1419050495,"links":["http:\/\/breast-cancer-research.com\/content\/16\/6\/499"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/breast-cancer-research.com\/content\/pdf\/s13058-014-0499-2.pdf","pmid":"25522654","pubdate":"2014-12-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"499","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Gene variations in oestrogen pathways, CYP19A1, daily 17\u03b2-estradiol and mammographic density phenotypes in premenopausal women","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s13058-014-0499-2","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gene-variations-oestrogen-pathways-cyp19a1-daily-17%CE%B2estradiol-mammographic-density-phenotypes-premen"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691823,"mean":5.4318361211662,"rank":3799220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":145302,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691823,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155128,"mean":8.2682002101505,"rank":121494,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1821,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155128,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":795,"mean":5.3247430730479,"rank":650,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":795,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":3.6459183673469,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
