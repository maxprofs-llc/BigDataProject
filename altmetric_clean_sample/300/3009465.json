In the present studies, we investigated the role of post-translational modification in the accumulation of MKP-1 and MKP-2 in macrophages following LPS stimulation. We found that upon LPS stimulation, MKP-1 and MKP-2 accumulated with different kinetics: MKP-1 level peaked at \u223c1 h, while MKP-2 levels continued to rise for at least 6 h. Accumulation of both MKP-1 and MKP-2 were attenuated by inhibition of the ERK cascade. Interestingly, p38 inhibition prior to LPS stimulation had little effect on MKP-1 and MKP-2 protein levels, but hindered their detection by an M-18 MKP-1 antibody. Studies of the epitope sequence recognized by the M-18 MKP-1 antibody revealed extensive phosphorylation of two serine residues in the C terminus of both MKP-1 and MKP-2 by the ERK pathway. Remarkably, the stability of both MKP-1 and MKP-2 was markedly decreased in macrophages in the presence of an ERK pathway inhibitor. Mutation of the two C-terminal serine residues in MKP-1 and MKP-2 to alanine decreased their half-lives, while mutating these residues to aspartate dramatically increased their half-lives. Deletion of the C terminus from MKP-1 and MKP-2 also considerably increased their stabilities. Surprisingly, enhanced stabilities of the MKP-1 and MKP-2 mutants were not associated with decreased ubiquitination. Degradation of both MKP-1 and MKP-2 was attenuated by proteasomal inhibitors. Our studies suggest that MKP-1 and MKP-2 stability is regulated by ERK-mediated phosphorylation through a degradation pathway independent of polyubiquitination.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Crowell SA","Wancket LM","Shikibi Y","Xu P","Xue J","Samavati L","Nelin LD","Liu Y"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m114.591925","first_seen_on":"2014-12-23T11:16:49+00:00","funders":["niaid","nhlbi"],"issns":["0021-9258"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1419338951,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25204653?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25204653","pubdate":"2014-09-11T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Post-translational Regulation of Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase Phosphatase (MKP)-1 and MKP-2 in Macrophages Following Lipopolysaccharide Stimulation-The role of the carboxyl terminals of the phosphatases in determining their stability.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/posttranslational-regulation-mitogenactivated-protein-kinase-phosphatase-mkp1-mkp2-macrophages-follo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691823,"mean":5.4318361211662,"rank":3211096,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":892398,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691823,"percentile":19},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155171,"mean":8.2631114777342,"rank":104102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":33539,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155171,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30644,"mean":2.5499216786868,"rank":23537,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":5192,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30644,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":338,"mean":3.0394183976261,"rank":205,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":338,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
