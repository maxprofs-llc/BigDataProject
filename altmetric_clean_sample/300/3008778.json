BPW and apple juice were treated at different temperatures (55\u00b0C, 58\u00b0C, and 60\u00b0C) and for different times (0, 10, 20, 25, and 30 s) by ohmic heating compared with conventional heating. The electric field strength was fixed at 30 V\/cm and 60 V\/cm for BPW and apple juice, respectively. Bacterial reduction resulting from ohmic heating was significantly different (P<0.05) from that resulting from conventional heating at 58\u00b0C and 60\u00b0C in BPW and at 55\u00b0C, 58\u00b0C, and 60\u00b0C in apple juice for intervals of 0, 10, 20, 25, and 30 s. These results show that electric field-induced ohmic heating led to additional bacterial inactivation at sublethal temperatures. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations and the propidium iodide (PI) uptake test were conducted after treatment at 60\u00b0C for 0, 10, 20, 25 and 30 s in BPW to observe the effects on cell permeability due to electroporation-caused cell damage. PI values when ohmic and conventional heating were compared were significantly different (P<0.05), and these differences increased with increasing levels of inactivation of three food-borne pathogens. These results demonstrate that ohmic heating can more effectively reduce bacterial populations at reduced temperatures and shorter time intervals, especially in acidic fruit juices such as apple juice. Therefore, loss of quality can be minimized in a pasteurization process incorporating ohmic heating.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022c6","authors":["Il-Kyu Park","Dong-Hyun Kang"],"doi":"10.1128\/aem.01818-13","first_seen_on":"2014-12-23T04:56:39+00:00","issns":["1098-5336"],"journal":"Applied & Environmental Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1419310559,"links":["http:\/\/aem.asm.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/79\/23\/7122"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/aem.asm.org\/content\/79\/23\/7122.full.pdf","pmid":"23995939","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Effect of Electropermeabilization by Ohmic Heating for Inactivation of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium, and Listeria monocytogenes in Buffered Peptone Water and Apple Juice","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-electropermeabilization-ohmic-heating-inactivation-escherichia-coli-o157-h7-salmonella-enteri"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691387,"mean":5.4355271855819,"rank":3799395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":144687,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691387,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155165,"mean":8.2825913356192,"rank":121630,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1819,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155165,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4226,"mean":4.2646381065089,"rank":3531,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":182,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4226,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99,"mean":6.2574081632653,"rank":79,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
