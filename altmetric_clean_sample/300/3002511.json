Although a viral infection activates the immune system's response that eradicates the pathogen mainly through inflammatory mechanisms, it is now recognized that this inflammatory condition is also favorable to the development of tumors. Indeed, it is well described that viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), Epstein Barr virus (EBV), human papillomavirus (HPV) or human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1), are important risk factors for tumor malignancies. The inflammatory response is a fundamental immune mechanism which involves several molecular and cellular components consisting of cytokines and chemokines that are released by various proinflammatory cells. In parallel to this process, some endogenous recruited components release anti-inflammatory mediators to restore homeostasis. The development of tools and strategies using viruses to hijack the immune response is mostly linked to the presence of regulatory T-cells (Treg) that can inhibit inflammation and antiviral responses of other effector cells. In this review, we will focus on current understanding of the role of natural and induced Treg in the control and the resolution of inflammatory response in HCV-, HTLV-1-, and EBV-associated cancers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5023cf058f61000308f","authors":["Laurissa Ouaguia","Dhafer Mrizak","Sarah Renaud","Olivier Moral\u00e8s","Nadira Delhem"],"doi":"10.1155\/2014\/564296","first_seen_on":"2014-12-20T11:40:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1466-1861"],"journal":"Mediators of Inflammation","last_mentioned_on":1441822086,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25525301?dopt=Abstract&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25525301?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4267219\/"],"pmid":"25525301","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pathology","biochemistry"],"title":"Control of the Inflammatory Response Mechanisms Mediated by Natural and Induced Regulatory T-Cells in HCV-, HTLV-1-, and EBV-Associated Cancers","type":"article","volume":"2014","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/control-inflammatory-response-mechanisms-mediated-natural-induced-regulatory-tcells-hcv-htlv1-ebvass"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6314918,"mean":5.8219859643445,"rank":2493832,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":3758045,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6314918,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193961,"mean":8.0802479480307,"rank":76175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":114662,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193961,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":874,"mean":1.865560137457,"rank":186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":676,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":874,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":1.8659615384615,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":44,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
