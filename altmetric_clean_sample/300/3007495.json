Despite lacking these resources, we wanted to provide effective simulation training at our rural hospital. A team of clinicians and educators developed a cost-effective and time-efficient simulation drill for nurses, which included both a didactic review and a simulation day. The drill included obstetric providers and incorporated scenarios for shoulder dystocia, neonatal resuscitation and postpartum hemorrhage. This was a successful multidisciplinary learning experience that was high in creativity and teamwork, but low in cost.
