Purified P450 BM3 mutant M02 enzyme hydroxylated the steroid with >95\u00a0% regioselectivity to form 16-\u03b2-OH norandrostenedione, as confirmed by NMR analysis. Whole cells of R. erythropolis RG9 expressing P450 BM3 M02 enzyme also converted norandrostenedione into the 16-\u03b2-hydroxylated product, resulting in the formation of about 0.35\u00a0g\/L. Whole cells of strain RG9 itself did not convert norandrostenedione, indicating that metabolite formation is P450 BM3 M02 enzyme mediated. This study shows that R. erythropolis is a novel and interesting host for the heterologous expression of highly selective and active P450 BM3 M02 enzyme variants able to perform steroid bioconversions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022dc","authors":["Venkataraman H","Te Poele EM","Ros\u0142oniec KZ","Vermeulen N","Commandeur JN","van der Geize R","Dijkhuizen L","Harini Venkataraman","Evelien M. te Poele","Kamila Z.
