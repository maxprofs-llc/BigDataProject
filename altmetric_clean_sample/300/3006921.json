We investigated DNA fragmentation by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), and Bcl-2 and Fas antigen expression by immunocytochemistry in skeletal muscles from 12 patients with hypothyroid myopathy and 5 patients with hyperthyroid myopathy. The finding of very few TUNEL-positive muscle fibers in both conditions suggests that apoptosis does not play a role in the pathogenesis of thyroid myopathies. Bcl-2 expression increased significantly in hypothyroid myopathy, correlating with high serum TSH levels, and not with either triiodothyronine (T3) or thyroxine (T4) serum levels. By contrast, Fas antigen was overexpressed in hyperthyroid myopathy, correlating with low TSH levels. These findings suggest an anti-apoptotic role for TSH itself in skeletal muscle.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f610008208","authors":["Maria C Monici","Carmelo Rodolico","Antonio Toscano","Sonia Messina","Salvatore Benvenga","Corrado Messina","Giuseppe Vita"],"doi":"10.1002\/mus.10212","first_seen_on":"2014-12-22T15:57:52+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0148-639X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Muscle & Nerve","last_mentioned_on":1419263867,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12210368"],"pmid":"12210368","pubdate":"2002-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology","neurology"],"title":"Apoptosis and apoptosis-related proteins in thyroid myopathies.","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/apoptosis-apoptosisrelated-proteins-thyroid-myopathies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":4198389,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177605,"mean":8.1187600391884,"rank":140868,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177605,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1050,"mean":3.171714013346,"rank":920,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1050,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":4.1346153846154,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Sports and Recreations":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bionavist\/status\/547058426086309888","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3006921],"posted_on":"2014-12-22T15:57:47+00:00","author":{"name":"Berkeley Bot","url":"http:\/\/markfarrell.ca\/creal","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/530906132680695808\/WJYpLqU8_normal.png","description":"Beep!
