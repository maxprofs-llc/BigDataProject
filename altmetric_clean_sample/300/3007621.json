Routine testing modalities have limited accuracy, and an oral food challenge is often required to make a definitive diagnosis. Given that they are labor intensive and risk inducing an allergic reaction, several alternative diagnostic modalities have been investigated. Testing for IgE antibodies to particular protein components in foods has shown promise to improve diagnostics and has entered clinical practice. Additional modalities show potential, including epitope binding, T-cell studies, and basophil activation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f610005975","doi":"10.1016\/j.iac.2014.09.009","first_seen_on":"2014-12-22T21:01:33+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["0889-8561"],"issue":"1","journal":"Immunology and allergy clinics of North America","last_mentioned_on":1420545687,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.immunology.theclinics.com%2Farticle%2FS0889-8561%252814%252900109-X%2Fabstract%3Frss%3Dyes&code=iac-site","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=9&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.immunology.theclinics.com%2Farticle%2FS0889-8561%252814%252900109-X%2Ffulltext&code=iac-site","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?code=iac-site&rc=0&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.immunology.theclinics.com%2Farticle%2FS0889-8561%252814%252900109-X%2Fabstract%3Frss%3Dyes"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.immunology.theclinics.com\/article\/S088985611400109X\/pdf","pmid":"25459577","pubdate":"2015-01-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"61","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Optimizing the Diagnosis of Food Allergy","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/optimizing-diagnosis-food-allergy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4702597,"mean":5.4369572291408,"rank":1068459,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":3623281,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4702597,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155777,"mean":8.276657020337,"rank":42565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":112731,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155777,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138,"mean":2.9247299270073,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":103,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":4.1132631578947,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
