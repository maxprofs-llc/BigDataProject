Although many of the acute effects of METH are mediated by its influences on the compartmentalization of dopamine, serotonin systems have also been suggested to influence the behavioral effects of METH in ways that are not fully understood. The present experiments examined serotonergic roles in METH-induced locomotor sensitization by assessing: (a) the effect of serotonin transporter (SERT; Slc6A4) knockout (KO) on METH-induced locomotor sensitization; (b) extracellular monoamine levels in METH-treated animals as determined by in-vivo microdialysis; and (c) effects of serotonin (5-HT) receptor antagonists on METH-induced behavioral sensitization, with focus on effects of the 5-HT1B receptor antagonist SB 216641 and a comparison with the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ketanserin. Repeated METH administration failed to induce behavioral sensitization in homozygous SERT KO (SERT-\/-) mice under conditions that produced substantial sensitization in wild-type or heterozygous SERT KO (SERT+\/-) mice. The selective 5-HT1B antagonist receptor SB 216641 restored METH-induced locomotor sensitization in SERT-\/- mice, whereas ketanserin was ineffective. METH-induced increases in extracellular 5-HT (5-HTex) levels were substantially reduced in SERT-\/- mice, although SERT genotype had no effect on METH-induced increases in extracellular dopamine. These experiments demonstrate that 5-HT actions, including those at 5-HT1B receptors, contribute to METH-induced locomotor sensitization. Modulation of 5-HT1B receptors might aid therapeutic approaches to the sequelae of chronic METH use.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c00","doi":"10.1097\/fbp.0000000000000120","first_seen_on":"2014-12-22T23:12:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0955-8810"],"journal":"Behavioural Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1419289918,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/behaviouralpharm\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Attenuated_methamphetamine_induced_locomotor.99569.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/behaviouralpharm\/9000\/00000\/Attenuated_methamphetamine_induced_locomotor.99569.pdf","pmid":"25485646","pubdate":"2014-12-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences","pharmacology"],"title":"Attenuated methamphetamine-induced locomotor sensitization in serotonin transporter knockout mice is restored by serotonin 1B receptor antagonist treatment.","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/attenuated-methamphetamineinduced-locomotor-sensitization-serotonin-transporter-knockout-mice-restor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4692005,"mean":5.4291783848369,"rank":3211181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":892450,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4692005,"percentile":19},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155142,"mean":8.2654825481338,"rank":104114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":33531,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155142,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":582,"mean":1.680908777969,"rank":230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":582,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.2605263157895,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
