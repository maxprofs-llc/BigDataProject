We recently showed that increased numbers of intratumoral T cells rather than immune-escape-mechanisms significantly correlated with clinical outcome of advanced melanoma patients to subsequent autologous tumor cell vaccination. Our data emphasize the therapeutic relevance of tumor-infiltrating T cells for the clinical outcome.","altmetric_jid":"557ed87946ff25d2316639ec","authors":["Esther P M Tjin","Rosalie M Luiten","Tjin, Esther P M","Luiten, Rosalie M"],"doi":"10.4161\/21624011.2014.954862","first_seen_on":"2014-12-21T10:46:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2162-402X","2162-4011"],"issue":"9","journal":"OncoImmunology","last_mentioned_on":1430933946,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.4161\/21624011.2014.954862","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25941603?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.4161\/21624011.2014.954862#.VJwlIF4AA"],"pmid":"25941603","pubdate":"2014-12-10T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"e954862","title":"Tumor-infiltrating T-cells: important players in clinical outcome of advanced melanoma patients.","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tumorinfiltrating-tcells-important-players-clinical-outcome-advanced-melanoma-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5064898,"mean":6.0012989180247,"rank":2085782,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":2896939,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5064898,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180028,"mean":8.0355883506364,"rank":63731,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":112917,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180028,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231,"mean":1.7502956521739,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":2.5,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"CR":1,"CL":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/canopyvalley\/status\/548130925968900097","license":"datasift","rt":["PiescheM"],"citation_ids":[3004018],"posted_on":"2014-12-25T14:59:31+00:00","author":{"name":"Canopy Valley Team","url":"http:\/\/canopyvalley.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/442769509300985856\/IpxD02yx_normal.jpeg","description":"Spreading the word about #SunSafety, #skincancerawareness, and #melanomaawareness , connecting with one person at a time.","id_on_source":"canopyvalley","tweeter_id":"942853262","geo":{"lt":"37.7884969","ln":"-122.3558473","country":"US"},"followers":1722},"tweet_id":"548130925968900097"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/LUXESBracelet\/status\/546639534063386624","license":"datasift","rt":["PiescheM"],"citation_ids":[3004018],"posted_on":"2014-12-21T12:13:15+00:00","author":{"name":"LUXES","url":"http:\/\/the-luxes.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000545423028\/28e3f96310984f752dd622402aa61782_normal.png","description":"LUXES is an unique tool to detect UV radiation in your surroundings and help raise #awareness about #SunSafety, #SkinCancer, and #Melanoma. #BeSunSmart !","id_on_source":"LUXESBracelet","tweeter_id":"1928370120","geo":{"lt":"9.7888222","ln":"-84.301611","country":"CR"},"followers":1251},"tweet_id":"546639534063386624"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PiescheM\/status\/546617666036072448","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3004018],"posted_on":"2014-12-21T10:46:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Matthias Piesche","url":"http:\/\/Gofundme.com\/immunotherapy","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/585519282508980225\/zir5JDT6_normal.jpg","description":"AssProf @ UCM. @DanaFarber\/@HarvardMed Alumnus.
