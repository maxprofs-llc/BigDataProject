For its potential applications in agriculture and medicine, GHRH analog with higher activity and longer half-life has been looked for. By using the fusion expression with unique acid labile linker Asp-Pro and biochemical purification, the three novel GHRH peptides, Pro-Pro-hGHRH(1-44)-Gly-Gly-Cys, Pro-hGHRH(1-44)-Gly-Gly-Cys, and (1)Pro-GHRH(2-44)-Gly-Gly-Cys, were obtained. The peptide molecular weight with 5,455, 5,373 or 5,210 Da measured by EIS-MS is coincident with the actual values. The peptides at 0.1-10 microg\/ml increased rat pituitary GH releases in a dose-dependent manner and at 5 microg\/ml increased human pituitary GH releases. The activity comparisons showed that at 10 microg\/ml there were significant between (1)Pro-hGHRH(2-44)-Gly-Gly-Cys and Pro-Pro-hGHRH(1-44)-Gly-Gly-Cys or Pro-hGHRH(1-44)-Gly-Gly-Cys, (1)Pro-hGHRH(2-44) (P<0.05). The (1)Pro-hGHRH(2-44)-Gly-Gly-Cys showed the highest GH release from rat pituitary. The activity results showed that the N-terminal Pro modulations and the C-terminal Gly-Gly-Cys extension regulate GH release from pituitary. The results showed that the three peptides had good GH release, function-selectivity and species specificity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003442","authors":["Tang SS","Du MH","Zhang JH","Kong X","Liu JJ"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.regpep.2009.09.010","first_seen_on":"2014-12-21T15:21:38+00:00","issns":["0167-0115"],"issue":"1-3","journal":"Regulatory Peptides","last_mentioned_on":1419175270,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19818814"],"pmid":"19818814","pubdate":"2009-10-13T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Structure and function relationships of three novel hGHRH-GGC analogs.","type":"article","volume":"159","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structure-function-relationships-three-novel-hghrhggc-analogs"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4751841,"mean":5.7092929728315,"rank":3977575,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4751841,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164234,"mean":8.190577204338,"rank":130439,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164234,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187,"mean":2.3196774193548,"rank":157,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.3166666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Physics and Astronomy":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bionavist\/status\/546686821854236672","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3004476],"posted_on":"2014-12-21T15:21:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Berkeley Bot","url":"http:\/\/markfarrell.ca\/creal","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/530906132680695808\/WJYpLqU8_normal.png","description":"Beep!
