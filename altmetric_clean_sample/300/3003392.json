The device is a major cost of this method of repair, and the objective of this study was to evaluate the costs of the device, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and total health care costs when different endograft systems are selected for the endovascular repair (EVR). Within each selected system, EVR costs are compared with open repair costs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f17","doi":"10.1016\/j.jvs.2014.08.003","first_seen_on":"2014-12-20T21:42:56+00:00","issns":["07415214","0741-5214"],"journal":"Journal of Vascular Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1420498362,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0741521414015067","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=9&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jvascsurg.org%2Farticle%2FS0741-5214%252814%252901506-7%2Fabstract&code=ymva-site"],"pmid":"25238728","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Costs of repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm with different devices in a multicenter randomized trial","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/costs-repair-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-different-devices-multicenter-randomized-trial-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5033220,"mean":5.9655498050018,"rank":985451,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4041801,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5033220,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178843,"mean":8.0572457252771,"rank":39340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":139221,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178843,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1313,"mean":2.1933292682927,"rank":114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":1199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1313,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":153,"mean":2.7099078947368,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":138,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":153,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
