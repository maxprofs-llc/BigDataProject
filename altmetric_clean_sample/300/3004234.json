Differential miRNA expression profiling and large-scale transient screening have been the prerequisite for the selection of miRNA candidates for stable manipulation, reported in CHO cells expressing a range of recombinant products. We selected a potent and well characterised tumour suppressor miRNA, miR-34a, as a high priority candidate for CHO cell engineering based on the conservation of both its sequence and function across species and cell type. Ectopic expression of miR-34a retained its functional conservation in CHO-SEAP cells by inhibiting growth by 90\u00a0% in addition to decreasing the viable cell population by 30\u00a0% when compared to controls. When the miR-34 family was stably depleted using a miRNA sponge decoy vector, the overall product yield was enhanced by ~2-fold in both fed-batch and small scale clonal batch cultures, despite having a negative impact on cell growth. These findings further strengthen the utility of miRNAs as engineering tools to modify and improve CHO cell performance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f6100064bd","authors":["Paul S Kelly","Clair Gallagher","Martin Clynes","Niall Barron"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10529-014-1751-7","first_seen_on":"2014-12-21T12:22:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-6776"],"journal":"Biotechnology Letters","last_mentioned_on":1420155263,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25527440?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25527440"],"pmid":"25527440","pubdate":"2014-12-21T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Conserved microRNA function as a basis for Chinese hamster ovary cell engineering.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/conserved-microrna-function-basis-chinese-hamster-ovary-cell-engineering"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691823,"mean":5.4318361211662,"rank":3211295,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":892200,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691823,"percentile":19},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155462,"mean":8.2339382481781,"rank":104193,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":33685,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155462,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":387,"mean":2.3580155440415,"rank":195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":140,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":387,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":0.72380952380952,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
