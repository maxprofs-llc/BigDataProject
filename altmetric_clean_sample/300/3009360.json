Whole-mount imaging techniques through the decalcified temporal bone and three-dimensional observations of Prox1-GFP mouse tissue revealed the positive labeling of the endolymphatic sac in adult stage, and allowed, for the first time, the GFP-based identification of endolymphatic sac epithelial cells.Prox1 expression was observed in all parts of the endolymphatic sac epithelia. In intermediate portion of the endolymphatic sac, mitochondria-rich cells did not express Prox1, although ribosome-rich cells showed strong GFP labeling. The anatomical relationship between the endolymphatic sac and the surrounding vasculature was directly observed. In the endolymphatic sac, expression of Prox1 may suggest progenitor cell-like pluripotency or developmental similarity to systemic lymphatic vessels in other organs. This whole-mount imaging technique of the endolymphatic sac can be combined with other conventional histological, sectioning, and labeling techniques and will be very useful for future endolymphatic sac research.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","authors":["Takenori Miyashita","James L Burford","Young-Kwon Hong","Haykanush Gevorgyan","Lisa Lam","Hiroshi Hoshikawa","Nozomu Mori","Janos Peti-Peterdi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbrc.2014.12.068","first_seen_on":"2014-12-23T11:03:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1090-2104"],"journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1429107263,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25529452?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25529452","pubdate":"2014-12-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Prox1 Expression in the Endolymphatic Sac revealed by Whole-Mount Fluorescent Imaging of Prox1-GFP Transgenic Mice.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prox1-expression-endolymphatic-sac-revealed-wholemount-fluorescent-imaging-prox1gfp-transgenic-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5000595,"mean":5.9176901672108,"rank":2303205,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2570950,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5000595,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175527,"mean":8.125510249194,"rank":73151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":96767,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175527,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6898,"mean":2.4861270117442,"rank":4572,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":2255,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6898,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170,"mean":1.7359644970414,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
