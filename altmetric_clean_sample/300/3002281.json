The signalling cascade linking microtubule disruption to MCL1 degradation remains however to be defined. Here, we establish an in vivo screening strategy in Caenorhabditis elegans to uncover genes involved in chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Using an RNAi-based screen, we identify three genes required for vincristine-induced apoptosis. We show that the DEP domain protein LET-99 acts upstream of the heterotrimeric G\u00a0protein alpha subunit GPA-11 to control activation of the stress kinase JNK-1. The human homologue of LET-99, DEPDC1, similarly regulates vincristine-induced cell death by promoting JNK-dependent degradation of the BCL-2 family protein MCL1. Collectively, these data uncover an evolutionarily conserved mediator of anti-tubulin drug-induced apoptosis and suggest that DEPDC1 levels could be an additional determinant for therapy response upstream of MCL1.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003163","authors":["Sendoel A","Maida S","Zheng X","Teo Y","Stergiou L","Rossi CA","Subasic D","Pinto SM","Kinchen JM","Shi M","Boettcher S","Meyer JN","Manz MG","Bano D","Hengartner MO","Ataman Sendoel","Simona Maida","Xue Zheng","Youjin Teo","Lilli Stergiou","Carlo-Alberto Rossi","Deni Subasic","Sergio M.
