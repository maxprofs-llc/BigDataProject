Yck3, a vacuolar membrane kinase, has been implicated in regulation of vacuole fusion. Recently, we established Env7 as another vacuolar membrane protein kinase with similar but nonredundant function to Yck3. Here, we report that native Env7 localizes to the vacuole independent of Yck3, where as its phosphorylation is YCK3 dependent. We also show that env7\u0394yck3\u0394 double mutant exhibits severely compromised fitness, altered cell size and bud vacuoles, and F-class vacuolar morphology. Our results establish negative genetic interactions between ENV7 and YCK3 and suggest cooperative roles for the two conserved genes in regulation of membrane dynamics. Such genetic buffering supports a critical role for membrane flux in global cell fitness.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028c6","authors":["Manandhar SP","Gharakhanian E"],"doi":"10.1111\/1567-1364.12128","first_seen_on":"2014-12-23T12:03:23+00:00","issns":["1567-1356"],"issue":"","journal":"FEMS Yeast Research","last_mentioned_on":1419336094,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24345185?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24345185","pubdate":"2013-12-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"ENV7 and YCK3, which encode vacuolar membrane protein kinases, genetically interact to impact cell fitness and vacuole morphology.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/env7-yck3-encode-vacuolar-membrane-protein-kinases-genetically-interact-impact-cell-fitness-vacuole"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691823,"mean":5.4318361211662,"rank":3799485,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":145418,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691823,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155171,"mean":8.2631092221436,"rank":121631,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1887,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155171,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":339,"mean":1.6808816568047,"rank":224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":339,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.93125,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
