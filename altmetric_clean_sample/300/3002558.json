A link between sAA, cortisol, and social\/evaluative stress has been established in youth, but little is known about these relationships in response to other stressors in children, and how social anxiety might moderate these relationships. The current study explored the associations among sAA and salivary cortisol responses to laboratory pain tasks and self-reported social anxiety symptoms in a sample of healthy children.","abstract_source":"pubmed","authors":["Laura A Payne","Leah C Hibel","Douglas A Granger","Jennie C I Tsao","Lonnie K Zeltzer","Payne LA","Hibel LC","Granger DA","Tsao JC","Zeltzer LK","& Lonnie K Zeltzer"],"doi":"10.4172\/jcalb.1000129","first_seen_on":"2014-12-20T12:02:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["","23754494","2375-4494"],"journal":"Animal Biotelemetry","last_mentioned_on":1420193919,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25525630?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25525630","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.4172\/jcalb.1000129"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.esciencecentral.org\/journals\/relationship-of-salivary-alpha-amylase-and-cortisol-to-social-anxiety-in-healthy-children-undergoing-laboratory-pain-tasks-2375-4494.1000129.pdf","pmcid":"PMC4267054","pmid":"25525630","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"OMICS International","title":"Relationship of Salivary Alpha Amylase and Cortisol to Social Anxiety in Healthy Children Undergoing Laboratory Pain Tasks.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.esciencecentral.org\/journals\/relationship-of-salivary-alpha-amylase-and-cortisol-to-social-anxiety-in-healthy-children-undergoing-laboratory-pain-tasks-2375-4494.1000129.php?aid=25563","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/relationship-salivary-alpha-amylase-cortisol-social-anxiety-healthy-children-undergoing-laboratory-p"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
