This work proposes a structure-wise registration with vector field integration (SW+VF) to map the largely deformed anatomies between EBRT and BT, paving the way for 3D dose accumulation between EBRT and BT.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5023cf058f61000309b","authors":["Eliana M.
