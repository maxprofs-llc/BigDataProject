HDLs may also modulate leukocyte and platelet activation, which may also represent an important target that would justify the use of HDL-based therapy in acute stroke. In this review, we will present an update of all the recent findings in HDL biology that could support a potential clinical use of HDL therapy in ischaemic stroke.","abstract_source":"pubmed","aggregated_in":[4034580],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9153cf058f61000cf04","authors":["Olivier Meilhac","Meilhac, Olivier"],"book":{"title":"High Density Lipoproteins","isbns":["9783319096643","9783319096650"],"uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/book\/10.1007%2F978-3-319-09665-0","attribution":"HLOM"},"doi":"10.1007\/978-3-319-09665-0_16","editors":["Arnold von Eckardstein","Dimitris Kardassis"],"first_seen_on":"2014-12-20T11:04:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0171-2004","1865-0325"],"journal":"Handbook of experimental pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1440263450,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25523000?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/chapter\/10.1007\/978-3-319-09665-0_16","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25523000?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"ordinal_number":16,"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2F978-3-319-09665-0_16.pdf","pmid":"25523000","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"series":{"title":"Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology","issn":"0171-2004"},"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"High-Density Lipoproteins in Stroke","type":"chapter","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/chapter\/10.1007%2F978-3-319-09665-0_16","volume":"224","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highdensity-lipoproteins-stroke"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5571003,"mean":6.3320664982719,"rank":2546415,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2885671,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5571003,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192389,"mean":8.0840886333868,"rank":79861,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":106518,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192389,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":256,"mean":3.2548862745098,"rank":123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":256,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":3.3850833333333,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Physics and Astronomy":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Computer Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"VE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bbbpapers\/status\/546259607169949697","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3002198,3002198,4034580],"posted_on":"2014-12-20T11:03:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Blood brain barrier","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/440531504972578816\/fylYz-PG_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #bbb papers in #PubMed.
