Furthermore, perturbation of the microbiota-host symbiosis (dysbiosis) is considered a common pathogenic mechanism connecting gastrointestinal, ocular and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Consequently, maintaining or restoring microbiota-host symbiosis represents a new approach to treat these symptoms or to prevent their relapses. Current treatment approach assigned a primary role to live probiotics alone or in combination with prebiotics to enhance colonization of beneficial bacteria and to strengthen the symbiosis. However, several papers showed major benefits of heat-killed probiotics as compared to their live counterparts on both intestinal and systemic symptoms. Recently, in addition to killing probiotics, in a proof of concept study lysates (fragments) of probiotics in combination with vitamins A, B, D and omega 3 fatty acids were successfully tested. These findings suggested a conceptual change in the approach addressed to both the microbiota and host as targets for intervention.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f61000840e","authors":["Feh\u00e9r J","Kov\u00e1cs I","Pacella E","Rad\u00e1k Z"],"doi":"10.1556\/oh.2014.29987","first_seen_on":"2014-12-20T23:27:32+00:00","issns":["0030-6002"],"issue":"37","journal":"Orvosi Hetilap","last_mentioned_on":1419693729,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25194867?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25194867","pubdate":"2014-09-10T23:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine","historyofmedicine"],"title":"[Microbiota-host symbiosis in the pathophysiology and treatment of irritable bowel, irritable eye and irritable mind syndrome].","type":"article","volume":"155","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microbiotahost-symbiosis-pathophysiology-treatment-irritable-bowel-irritable-eye-irritable-mind-synd"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8421798,"mean":7.0860618395254,"rank":3787085,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4541708,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8421798,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243837,"mean":7.7690730819075,"rank":91748,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":148886,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243837,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":396,"mean":1.5832962025316,"rank":114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":280,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":396,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":0.59090909090909,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
