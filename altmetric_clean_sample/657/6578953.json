The structures of the glycopolymers were established using a combination of chemical and NMR spectroscopic methods. The cell wall of S. albus subsp. albus VKM Ac-35(T) was found to be comprised of three glycopolymers, viz. unsubstituted 1,5-poly(ribitol phosphate), 1,3-poly(glycerol phosphate) substituted with \u03b2-D-glucopyranose, and the major polymer, a 3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-non-2-ulosonic acid (Kdn)-teichulosonic acid: \u03b2-D-Glcp-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a08)-\u03b1-Kdnp-(2[(\u21926)-\u03b2-D-Glcp-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a08)-\u03b1-Kdnp-(2\u00a0\u2192] n 6)-\u03b2-D-Glcp-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a08)-\u03b2-Kdnp-(2-OH, where n\u00a0\u2265\u00a03. The cell walls of 'S. albus' J1074 and 'S. albus' R1-100 were found to contain three glycopolymers of identical structures, viz. unsubstituted 1,3- and 2,3-poly(glycerol phosphates), and the major polymer, a Kdn-teichulosonic acid with an unusual structure that has not been previously described: \u03b2-D-Galp-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a09)-\u03b1-Kdnp-(2[(\u21923)-\u03b2-D-Galp-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a09)-\u03b1-Kdnp-(2\u00a0\u2192] n 3)-\u03b2-D-Galp-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a09)-\u03b2-Kdnp-(2-OH, where n\u00a0~\u00a07-8. The cell wall of S. pathocidini (formerly S. albus subsp. pathocidicus) VKM Ac-598(T) was found to contain two glycopolymers, viz. 1,3-poly(glycerol phosphate) partially O-glycosylated with 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-\u03b1-D-glucopyranose and\/or O-acylated with L-lysine, and a poly(diglycosyl 1-phosphate) of hitherto unknown structure: -6)-\u03b1-D-Glcp-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a06)-\u03b1-D-GlcpNAc-(1-P-.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f6100064e7","authors":["Shashkov, Alexander S","Streshinskaya, Galina M","Tul'skaya, Elena M","Senchenkova, Sophia N","Baryshnikova, Lidia M","Dmitrenok, Andrey S","Ostash, Bohdan E","Fedorenko, Victor A"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10482-016-0691-8","first_seen_on":"2016-04-09T13:02:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1572-9699","0003-6072"],"journal":"Antonie van Leeuwenhoek","last_mentioned_on":1460206894,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27055525?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27055525","pubdate":"2016-04-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Soil Science & Conservation","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["microbiology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Cell wall glycopolymers of Streptomyces albus, Streptomyces albidoflavus and Streptomyces pathocidini","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cell-wall-glycopolymers-streptomyces-albus-streptomyces-albidoflavus-streptomyces-pathocidini"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7523579,"mean":6.5040957411445,"rank":5695242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1006473,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7523579,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271527,"mean":11.249825350058,"rank":190802,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":42061,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271527,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":790,"mean":1.9532674271229,"rank":508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":206,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":790,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":2.4606451612903,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Strep_papers\/statuses\/718785929507241984","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6578953],"posted_on":"2016-04-09T13:01:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Strep_papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513367728158044160\/4aRFryWr_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot of #Streptomyces papers in #Pubmed\r\ncreated and curated by @paulhoskisson","id_on_source":"Strep_papers","tweeter_id":"2822299628","geo":{"lt":55.86515,"ln":-4.25763,"country":"GB"},"followers":321},"tweet_id":"718785929507241984"}]}}
