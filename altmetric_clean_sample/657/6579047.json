Patients who had to be switched to another biologic agent due to inefficacy or intolerance to IFX or ADA or patient's decision were assessed. The main outcome measures were the degree of anterior and posterior chamber inflammation and macular thickness.\nSeven (5.6%) of 124 cases (4 women\/3 men; mean age, 43 (range 28- 67) years; 12 affected eyes) were studied. Five of them had been initially treated with ADA and 2 with IFX. The other biologic agents used were golimumab (n=4), tocilizumab (n=2) and rituximab (n=1). The ocular pattern was panuveitis (n=4) or posterior uveitis (n=3). Uveitis was bilateral in 5 patients (71.4%). At baseline, anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation were present in 6 (50%) and 7 (58.3%) of the eyes. All the patients (12 eyes) had macular thickening (OCT>250\u03bcm) and 4 of them (7 eyes), cystoid macular edema (OCT>300 \u03bcm). Besides reduction anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation, we observed a reduction of OCT values, from 330.4\u00b158.5 \u03bcm at the onset of the biological agent to 273\u00b150 \u03bcm at month 12 (p=0.06). Six patients achieved a complete remission of uveitis.\nThe vast majority of patients with BU refractory to standard immunosuppressive drugs are successfully controlled with ADA and\/or IFX. Other biologic agents appear to be also useful.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006ef6","authors":["Santos-G\u00f3mez, Montserrat","Calvo-R\u00edo, Vanesa","Blanco, Ricardo","Beltr\u00e1n, Emma","Mesquida, Marina","Ad\u00e1n, Alfredo","Cordero-Coma, Miguel","Garc\u00eda-Aparicio, \u00c1ngel M","Valls Pascual, Elia","Mart\u00ednez-Costa, Luc\u00eda","Hern\u00e1ndez, Mar\u00eda Victoria","Hernandez Garfella, Marisa","Gonz\u00e1lez-Vela, Mar\u00eda C","Pina, Trinitario","Palmou-Fontana, Natalia","Loricera, Javier","Hern\u00e1ndez, Jos\u00e9 L","Gonz\u00e1lez-Gay, Miguel A","Montserrat Santos-G\u00f3mez","Vanesa Calvo-R\u00edo","Ricardo Blanco","Emma Beltr\u00e1n","Marina Mesquida","Alfredo Ad\u00e1n","Miguel Cordero-Coma","\u00c1ngel M Garc\u00eda-Aparicio","Elia Valls Pascual","Luc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez-Costa","Mar\u00eda Victoria Hern\u00e1ndez","Marisa Hernandez Garfella","Mar\u00eda C Gonz\u00e1lez-Vela","Trinitario Pina","Natalia Palmou-Fontana","Javier Loricera","Jos\u00e9 L Hern\u00e1ndez","Miguel A Gonz\u00e1lez-Gay"],"first_seen_on":"2016-04-09T13:14:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0392-856X"],"issue":"6","journal":"Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology","last_mentioned_on":1461480407,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27054359\/","https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/299985159_The_effect_of_biologic_therapy_different_from_infliximab_or_adalimumab_in_patients_with_refractory_uveitis_due_to_Behcet's_disease_results_of_a_multicentre_open-label_study"],"pmid":"27054359","pubdate":"2016-04-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"The effect of biologic therapy different from infliximab or adalimumab in patients with refractory uveitis due to Beh\u00e7et's disease: results of a multicentre open-label study.","type":"article","volume":"34 Suppl 102","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-biologic-therapy-different-infliximab-adalimumab-patients-refractory-uveitis-due-behcets-dise-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7596091,"mean":6.5461949734624,"rank":3368780,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4152108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7596091,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272546,"mean":11.255622521051,"rank":118287,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":149660,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272546,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":620,"mean":2.2943295638126,"rank":197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":414,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":620,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":1.4414634146341,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
