Since these patients are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and end-organ damage, additional therapies must be considered. This review discusses several novel interventional therapies-including baroreflex activation therapy, baroreceptor stenting, and creation of an arteriovenous shunt-that may provide alternative options for blood pressure control in those with treatment-resistant hypertension. All of these therapies remain investigational, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses that will be critical to assess as they come to market.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f610004203","authors":["Paivanas, Nicholas","Bisognano, John D","Gassler, John P"],"doi":"10.14797\/mdcj-11-4-223","endpage":"227","first_seen_on":"2016-04-09T08:52:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1947-6108","1947-6094"],"issue":"4","journal":"Methodist DeBakey Cardiovascular Journal","last_mentioned_on":1460188934,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27057291"],"pmid":"27057291","pubdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"223","subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Carotid Baroreceptor Stimulation and Arteriovenous Shunts for Resistant Hypertension","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/carotid-baroreceptor-stimulation-arteriovenous-shunts-resistant-hypertension"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7523579,"mean":6.5040957411445,"rank":6517002,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7523579,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271528,"mean":11.249791284108,"rank":229438,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271528,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65,"mean":9.79978125,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":2.1,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
