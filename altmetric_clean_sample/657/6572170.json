Patients were randomly assigned to receive 5-ASA at a dosage of either 4.8 or 1.6 g per day or placebo for six weeks. The outcome was monitored by flexible proctosigmoidoscopic examinations and physicians' assessments at three-week intervals and by patients' recordings of daily symptoms. Results showed 24 percent complete and 50 percent partial responses in those receiving 4.8 g of 5-ASA per day as compared with 5 percent complete and 13 percent partial responses in those receiving placebo (P less than 0.0001, rank-sum test). At a dosage of 1.6 g per day, the response was twice as good as with placebo, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.51). Age, sex, duration of disease, duration of active symptoms, or extent of disease did not affect the clinical outcome. We conclude that oral 5-ASA administered in a dosage of 4.8 g per day is effective therapy, at least in the short term, for mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50e3cf058f6100031c4","authors":["Schroeder, K W","Tremaine, W J","Ilstrup, D M"],"doi":"10.1056\/nejm198712243172603","endpage":"1629","first_seen_on":"2016-04-09T07:44:57+00:00","issns":["0028-4793","1533-4406"],"issue":"26","journal":"New England Journal of Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1460049900,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3317057"],"pmid":"3317057","pubdate":"1987-12-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1625","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Coated Oral 5-Aminosalicylic Acid Therapy for Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis","type":"article","volume":"317","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/coated-oral-5aminosalicylic-acid-therapy-mildly-moderately-active-ulcerative-colitis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7516464,"mean":6.5017388130518,"rank":926173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":6569977,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7516464,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271448,"mean":11.249822020505,"rank":49662,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":221272,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271448,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19009,"mean":44.113490635522,"rank":8430,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":10498,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19009,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319,"mean":175.84576100629,"rank":255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":64,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":23,"Student  > Doctoral Student":11,"Student  > Ph.
