When contact pressures are applied to the stepped output tactile sensor (SOTS), the sensor's suspended diaphragm makes contact with the substrate, which completes a circuit by connecting resistive current paths. Then the contact area, and therefore the number of current paths, would determine the stepped output current produced. This mechanism allows SOTS to have high signal-to-noise ratio (>20 dB) in the 3-500 Hz frequency range at contact pressures below 15 kPa. Moreover, since the sensor's operation does not depend on a material's pressure-dependent electrical properties, the SOTS is able to demonstrate high reproducibility and reliability. By forming a 4 \u00d7 4 array of SOTS with a surface bump structure, we demonstrated shear sensing as well as surface (1 \u00d7 1 cm\u00b2) pressure mapping capabilities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5333cf058f6100045ba","authors":["Eunsuk Choi"],"doi":"10.3390\/s16040511","first_seen_on":"2016-04-09T12:57:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1424-8220"],"issue":"4","journal":"Sensors (14248220)","last_mentioned_on":1460447477,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/16\/4\/511"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/16\/4\/511\/pdf","pmid":"27070626","pubdate":"2016-04-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Contact Pressure Level Indication Using Stepped Output Tactile Sensors","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/contact-pressure-level-indication-using-stepped-output-tactile-sensors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7540906,"mean":6.5135694142772,"rank":6531830,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7540906,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271729,"mean":11.254572984749,"rank":229678,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271729,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2885,"mean":1.8033509015257,"rank":1926,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2885,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":166,"mean":1.2754545454545,"rank":103,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":166,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
