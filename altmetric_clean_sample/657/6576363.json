Here we present the first case of ALPPS done after double TACE procedure in a 64-years-old female patient with extensive hepatocellular carcinoma of the right liver lobe. The procedure was successful and liver remnant showed significant 90% hypertrophy which proves that ALPPS sometimes can be performed after palliative procedures in liver malignancies.Key words: hepatocellular carcinoma -\u200a associating liver partition and portal vein ligation (ALPPS) -\u200a trans-hepatic arterial chemoembolization (TACE) -\u200a liver -\u200a resection -\u200a hypertrophy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9163cf058f61000cfdd","authors":["Romic, B","Romic, I","Mance, M","Pavlek, G","Skegro, M"],"first_seen_on":"2016-04-09T11:07:59+00:00","issns":["0862-495X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Klinick\u00e1 onkologie casopis Cesk\u00e9 a Slovensk\u00e9 onkologick\u00e9 spolecnosti","last_mentioned_on":1460200058,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26879064?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26879064","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Successful Associating Liver Partition and Portal Vein Ligation after Unsuccessful Double TACE Procedure Complicated with Sepsis and Pancreatitis.","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/successful-associating-liver-partition-portal-vein-ligation-after-unsuccessful-double-tace-procedure"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7523579,"mean":6.5040957411445,"rank":6517053,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7523579,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271528,"mean":11.249785207364,"rank":229462,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271528,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90,"mean":0.58903370786517,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Unspecified":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/statuses\/718757258625032192","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6576363],"posted_on":"2016-04-09T11:07:38+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":377},"tweet_id":"718757258625032192"}]}}
