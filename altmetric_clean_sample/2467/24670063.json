In the present study, we examined the age-related changes of oxytocin-mRFP1 fluorescent intensity in the posterior pituitary (PP), the supraoptic nucleus (SON) and the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of transgenic rats. The mRFP1 fluorescent intensities were significantly increased in the PP, the SON and the PVN of 12-, 18- and 24-month-old transgenic rats in comparison with 3-month-old transgenic rats. Immunohistochemical staining for urocortin, which belongs to the family of corticotropin-releasing factor family, revealed that the numbers of urocortin-like immunoreactive (LI) cells in the SON and the PVN were significantly increased in 12-, 18- and 24-month-old transgenic rats in comparison with 3-month-old transgenic rats. Almost all of urocortin-LI cells co-exist mRFP1-expressing cells in the SON and the PVN of aged transgenic rats. These results suggest that oxytocin content of the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system may be modulated by age-related regulation. The physiological role of the co-existence of oxytocin and urocortin in the SON and PVN of aged rats remains unclear.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031ad","authors":["Shigeo Ohno","Hirofumi Hashimoto","Hiroaki Fujihara","Nobuhiro Fujiki","Mitsuhiro Yoshimura","Takashi Maruyama","Yasuhito Motojima","Reiko Saito","Hiromichi Ueno","Satomi Sonoda","Motoko Ohno","Yuichi Umezu","Akinori Hamamura","Satoru Saeki","Yoichi Ueta"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neures.2017.08.001","first_seen_on":"2017-09-02T13:09:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["01680102","1872-8111"],"journal":"Neuroscience Research","last_mentioned_on":1504357746,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28859972?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28859972","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Increased oxytocin-monomeric red fluorescent protein 1 fluorescent intensity with urocortin-like immunoreactivity in the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system of aged transgenic rats","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increased-oxytocinmonomeric-red-fluorescent-protein-1-fluorescent-intensity-urocortinlike-immunoreac"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8461697,"mean":7.1088157534769,"rank":7311324,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8461697,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173974,"mean":12.355384686129,"rank":142099,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173974,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":514,"mean":2.4120506822612,"rank":365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":514,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.3214285714286,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BlameOxytocin\/statuses\/903968024188694531","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24670063],"posted_on":"2017-09-02T13:09:06+00:00","author":{"name":"The Love Hormone","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/647614031289708544\/4CuoFMsx_normal.png","description":"RSS feed of oxytocin and vasopressin papers in PubMed.
