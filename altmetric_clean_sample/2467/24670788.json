Abdominal ultrasound, computerized tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging reports were retrieved from the Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse from a random national sample of 652 patients. Radiographic fatty liver disease was determined by manual review by two physicians and verified with an expert radiologist. A split validation method was utilized for algorithm development.\nFor all three imaging modalities, the algorithms could identify fatty liver disease with >90% recall and precision, with F-measures >90%.\nThese algorithms could be used to rapidly screen patient records to establish a large cohort to facilitate epidemiological and clinical studies and examine the clinic course and outcomes of patients with radiographic hepatic steatosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002709","authors":["Joseph S.
