Data Source Six electronic databases were searched, including Medline, CINAHL, Embase, the Cochrane Database, DARE, and PubMed for all publications since the earliest date available in each database to February 2016. Study Selection Selected articles were full text articles addressing the use of telemedicine to support patient care in pre-hospital or emergency department settings. The search yielded 2976 articles for review with 11 studies eligible for inclusion after application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A scoping review of the selected articles was performed to better understand the different systems in place around the world and the current state of evidence supporting telemedicine use in the emergency department.\nTelemedicine support for emergency department physicians is an application with significant potential but is still lacking evidence supporting improved patient outcomes. Advances in technology, combined with more attractive price-points have resulted in widespread interest and implementation around the world. Applications of this technology that are currently being studied include support for minor treatment centres, patient transfer decision-making, management of acutely ill patients and scheduled teleconsultations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002534","authors":["Kelton, Danielle K.","Szulewski, Adam","Howes, Daniel"],"doi":"10.1017\/cem.2017.382","first_seen_on":"2017-08-23T10:54:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1481-8035","1481-8043"],"journal":"CJEM: Canadian Journal of Emergency Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1503485822,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28829008?dopt=Abstract&utm_content=buffer0778d&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmid":"28829008","pubdate":"2017-08-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cambridge University Press (CUP)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["emergencymedicine"],"title":"Real-time video telemedicine applications in the emergency department: a scoping review of literature","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/realtime-video-telemedicine-applications-emergency-department-scoping-review-literature"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":6388551,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1143333,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169959,"mean":12.72477128467,"rank":120697,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":30569,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169959,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":591,"mean":7.0781593220339,"rank":505,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":591,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":9,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Computer Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FI":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Med2Meds\/statuses\/900310145388994560","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24217147],"posted_on":"2017-08-23T10:54:00+00:00","author":{"name":"Med2Meds","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3096611195\/abe76ac7fa41a8f791a5d501ac1be664_normal.jpeg","description":"Comunicar, compartir experiencia, consultar...
