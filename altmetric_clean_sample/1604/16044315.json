The prevalence of EIPH in barrel racing horses is also unknown.\nThis study was performed to determine the prevalence of EIPH and signs of airway inflammation in barrel racing horses under normal racing conditions in Alberta.\nAbout 170 barrel racing horses.\nObservational cross-sectional study. Tracheobronchoscopic examinations were performed at least 30 minutes postrace. Video recordings were scored off-site independently by two observers for EIPH and tracheal mucus accumulation (TMA). Horses with an EIPH score \u22652 were not assessed for TMA. Interobserver agreement was calculated by weighted \u03ba statistics. Run times, environmental variables, and clinical information were also recorded for analysis.\n77\/170 (45.3%) of horses examined showed evidence of EIPH (grade \u2265 1). Interobserver agreement was 0.94. 140\/141 (99.3%) of horses assessed for TMA showed evidence of tracheal mucus accumulation (grade \u2265 1) with 104\/141 (73.8%) having a TMA score \u2265 2. Interobserver agreement was 0.73. A weak positive association was found between EIPH scores and average run speed, the presence of cough at rest reported by the riders, increased recovery time, exercise intolerance, and outdoor pattern.\nThe high prevalence of EIPH observed in the sampled population indicates that barrel racing induces substantial stress on the lungs. The presence of EIPH did not impact negatively on performance. Factors such as environmental dust and frequent traveling might have contributed to the high prevalence of TMA observed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52d3cf058f610004131","authors":["L\u00e9guillette, R.","Steinmann, M.","Bond, S.L.","Stanton, B.","R.
