February JADA Case Report."],"citation":{"abstract":"The aim of this study was to describe the effects of bruxism in peri-implant bone loss\u00a06 years after the placement of a successful implant-supported prosthesis, to describe its treatment, and to propose a differential diagnosis of the lesion.\nA 62-year-old, nonsmoking, systemically healthy partially edentulous woman received 2 osseointegrated implants in the mandibular left region, which supported a 3-element fixed prosthesis. Six years later, the patient reported the development of bruxism. Clinical examination results indicated bleeding on probing, deepening of the peri-implant sulcus, and marginal soft-tissue overgrowth. Radiographic images suggested peri-implant bone loss. The authors diagnosed the lesion as trauma from occlusion and mucositis. Treatment involved anti-infective therapy and the use of a bite platform, resulting in bone recovery after 10 months. These results were maintained for 4 years.\nConsidering the existing contradictions in the literature, this case highlights the role of trauma from occlusion in the onset, progression, and treatment of lesions produced by occlusal overload around osseointegrated implants. In addition, it provides clinical background on the outcomes of anti-infective therapy associated with the use of a bite platform in the treatment of combined lesions of mucositis and trauma from occlusion in osseointegrated implants.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f59","authors":["Euloir Passanezi","Adriana Campos Passanezi Sant\u2019Ana","Carla Andreotti Damante"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.adaj.2016.09.009","first_seen_on":"2017-02-02T01:00:18+00:00","issns":["00028177","0002-8177"],"journal":"Journal of the American Dental Association (JADA)","last_mentioned_on":1486050444,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=2&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fjada.ada.org%2Farticle%2FS0002-81771630748-6%2Ffulltext&code=adaj-site","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=1&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fjada.ada.org%2Farticle%2FS0002-81771630748-6%2Ffulltext&code=adaj-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jada.ada.org\/article\/S0002817716307486\/pdf","pmid":"27793325","pubdate":"2016-10-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Occlusal trauma and mucositis or peri-implantitis?","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0002817716307486","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/occlusal-trauma-mucositis-periimplantitis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.2,"score_history":{"1y":2.2,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8150076,"mean":6.9043957460448,"rank":3462448,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4674478,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8150076,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262930,"mean":12.856356050492,"rank":110634,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":151651,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262930,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1122,"mean":7.2891935771632,"rank":767,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":354,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1122,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":20.288292682927,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"CA":1},"mendeley":{"NZ":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ADANews\/statuses\/826958317926940672","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16042594],"posted_on":"2017-02-02T01:00:01+00:00","author":{"name":"ADA News","url":"http:\/\/www.ada.org\/en\/home-ada\/publications\/ada-news","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2528418382\/o17ffbedxcrsi99i0c20_normal.jpeg","description":"Welcome to the American Dental Association's ADA News Twitter page.
