In this study, we used primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to evaluate the endothelial NO system in preeclampsia and to determine the underlying mechanisms that are involved. We isolated and cultured HUVECs from normal and preeclamptic pregnancies and evaluated endothelial NO synthase enzyme (eNOS) expression and NO production. Whole-cell K(+) currents and oxidative stress were also determined in normal and preeclamptic HUVECs. Compared with normal HUVECs, eNOS expression, NO production and whole-cell K(+) currents in preeclamptic HUVECs were markedly decreased, whereas oxidative stress was significantly increased. The decreased K(+) currents were associated with damaged Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (KCa) channels, especially the large (BKCa) and small (SKCa) conductance KCa channels, and were involved in the downregulated eNOS expression in preeclamptic HUVECs. Moreover, the increased oxidative stress detected in preeclamptic HUVECs was mediated by NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase 2 (NOX2)-dependent reactive oxygen species overproduction that could downregulate whole-cell K(+) currents, eNOS expression and NO production. Taken together, our study indicated that the increased oxidative stress in preeclamptic HUVECs could downregulate the NO system by suppressing BKCa and SKCa channels. Because the damaged NO system was closely related to endothelial dysfunction, this study provides important information to further understand the pathological process of endothelial cell dysfunction in preeclampsia.Hypertension Research advance online publication, 12 January 2017; doi:10.1038\/hr.2016.180.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f610007694","authors":["Jie Chen","Qinqin Gao","Lin Jiang","Xueqin Feng","Xiaolin Zhu","Xiaorong Fan","Caiping Mao","Zhice Xu"],"doi":"10.1038\/hr.2016.180","first_seen_on":"2017-01-29T05:25:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0916-9636","1348-4214"],"journal":"Hypertension Research","last_mentioned_on":1485667507,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/hr\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/hr2016180a.html"],"pmid":"28077855","pubdate":"2017-01-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"The NOX2-derived reactive oxygen species damaged endothelial nitric oxide system via suppressed BKCa\/SKCa in preeclampsia","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nox2derived-reactive-oxygen-species-damaged-endothelial-nitric-oxide-system-via-suppressed-bkcaskca"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8148366,"mean":6.8920487793494,"rank":7056327,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8148366,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262829,"mean":12.810977293134,"rank":217704,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262829,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":475,"mean":4.3393248945148,"rank":376,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":475,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.65,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
