In Expt. 3, hepatic fatty acid synthase (Fasn) expression was evaluated in 8-wk-old male Fasn-promoter-reporter mice fed a casein- or MuPI-containing high-fat diet for 20 wk. In Expt. 4, hepatic fibrosis was examined in 8-wk-old male mice fed an atherogenic diet (61% of energy from fat, containing 1.3 g cholesterol\/100 g diet) containing casein or MuPI (18% of energy) as a protein source for 20 wk.\nIn the high fat-diet mice, the hepatic TG concentration in the MuPI group decreased by 66% and 47% in Expt. 1 compared with the casein group (P < 0.001) and the soy protein isolate group (P = 0.001), respectively, and decreased by 56% in Expt. 2 compared with the casein group (P = 0.011). However, there was no difference between the MuPI-constituent amino acid mixture and casein groups in Expt. 2. In Expt. 3, Fasn-promoter-reporter activity and hepatic TG concentration were lower in the MuPI group than in those fed casein (P < 0.05). In Expt. 4, in mice fed an atherogenic diet, hepatic fibrosis was not induced in the MuPI group, whereas it developed overtly in the casein group.\nMuPI potently reduced hepatic lipid accumulation in mice and may be a potential foodstuff to prevent NAFLD onset and progression.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e8d","authors":["Hitoshi Watanabe","Yuka Inaba","Kumi Kimura","Shun-ichiro Asahara","Yoshiaki Kido","Michihiro Matsumoto","Takayasu Motoyama","Nobuhiko Tachibana","Shuichi Kaneko","Mitsutaka Kohno","Hiroshi Inoue"],"doi":"10.3945\/jn.116.231662","endpage":"60","first_seen_on":"2017-01-29T07:25:20+00:00","issns":["0022-3166","1541-6100"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1488551188,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3945\/%E2%80%8Bjn.116.231662","http:\/\/jn.nutrition.org\/content\/147\/1\/52.short?ssource=mfr&rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jn.nutrition.org\/content\/147\/1\/52.full.pdf","pmid":"27903831","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"52","subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Dietary Mung Bean Protein Reduces Hepatic Steatosis, Fibrosis, and Inflammation in Male Mice with Diet-Induced, Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/jn.nutrition.org\/lookup\/doi\/10.3945\/jn.116.231662","volume":"147","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dietary-mung-bean-protein-reduces-hepatic-steatosis-fibrosis-inflammation-male-mice-dietinduced-nona"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8302052,"mean":6.9984430163018,"rank":4178348,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3911138,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8302052,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":274803,"mean":12.600149343891,"rank":143305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":120987,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":274803,"percentile":44},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3947,"mean":14.181641662443,"rank":2705,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":1129,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3947,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":18.897833333333,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
