The main aim of this study was to obtain antioxidant-enriched fractions from the common seaweed Fucus spiralis and evaluate their activity and efficiency in protecting human cells (MCF-7 cells) on an oxidative stress condition induced by H\u2082O\u2082. Five fractions, F1-F5, were obtained by reversed-phase vacuum liquid chromatography. F3, F4 and F5 revealed the highest phlorotannin content, also showing the strongest antioxidant effects. The cell death induced by H\u2082O\u2082 was reduced by all fractions following the potency order F4 > F2 > F3 > F5 > F1. Only fraction F4 completely inhibited the H\u2082O\u2082 effect. To understand the possible mechanisms of action of these fractions, the cellular production of H\u2082O\u2082, the mitochondrial membrane potential and the caspase 9 activity were studied. Fractions F3 and F4 presented the highest reduction on H\u2082O\u2082 cell production. All fractions decreased both caspase-9 activity and cell membrane depolarization (except F1). Taken all together, the edible F. spiralis reveal that they provide protection against oxidative stress induced by H\u2082O\u2082 on the human MCF-7 cellular model, probably acting as upstream blockers of apoptosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e6e","authors":["Susete Pinteus","Joana Silva","Celso Alves","Andr\u00e9 Horta","Olivier Thomas","Rui Pedrosa"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijms18020292","first_seen_on":"2017-01-29T08:39:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1422-0067"],"issue":"2","journal":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1485932497,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/18\/2\/292?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/18\/2\/292?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/18\/2\/292\/pdf","pmid":"28146076","pubdate":"2017-01-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Antioxidant and Cytoprotective Activities of Fucus spiralis Seaweed on a Human Cell in Vitro Model","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antioxidant-cytoprotective-activities-fucus-spiralis-seaweed-human-cell-vitro-model"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8161363,"mean":6.8964925866473,"rank":3854290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4126163,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8161363,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263480,"mean":12.800808975288,"rank":128392,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":127633,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263480,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5180,"mean":2.369833944777,"rank":1350,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":3617,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5180,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":580,"mean":2.2430189982729,"rank":138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":405,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":580,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
