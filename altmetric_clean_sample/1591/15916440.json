Considering that microglia are resident immune cells of the brain, a homeostatic maintenance of their effector functions that impact neuronal circuitry, such as phagocytosis and secretion of inflammatory factors, is critical to prevent the onset and progression of these pathological conditions. However, the molecular mechanisms by which microglial functions can be properly regulated under healthy and pathological conditions are still largely unknown. We aim to summarize recent progress regarding the effects of psychosocial stress and oxidative stress on microglial phenotypes, leading to neuroinflammation and impaired microglia-synapse interactions, notably through our own studies of inbred mouse strains, and most importantly, to discuss about promising therapeutic strategies that take advantage of microglial functions to tackle such brain disorders in the context of adult psychosocial stress or aging-induced oxidative stress.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033b5","authors":["Li Tian","Chin Wai Hui","Kanchan Bisht","Yunlong Tan","Kaushik Sharma","Song Chen","Xiangyang Zhang","Marie-Eve Tremblay"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pnpbp.2017.01.007","first_seen_on":"2017-01-29T02:10:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["02785846"],"journal":"Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology & Biological Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1485655777,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0278584617300350","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0278584617300350&_version=1&md5=b7981eaea0342bc2c8661b95467f696f"],"pmid":"28095309","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychopharmacology","psychiatry"],"title":"Microglia under psychosocial stressors along the aging trajectory: Consequences on neuronal circuits, behavior, and brain diseases","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0278584617300350","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microglia-under-psychosocial-stressors-along-aging-trajectory-consequences-neuronal-circuits-behavio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8236937,"mean":6.9707245456257,"rank":5959809,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1984219,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8236937,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269942,"mean":12.696956038541,"rank":180391,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":75644,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269942,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1197,"mean":4.508220735786,"rank":806,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":349,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1197,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":2.3,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
