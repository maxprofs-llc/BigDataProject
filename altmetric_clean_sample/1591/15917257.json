In this sense, AMPK maintains cellular energy homeostasis by induction of catabolism and inhibition of ATP-consuming biosynthetic pathways to preserve ATP levels. Several studies indicate a reduction of AMPK sensitivity to cellular stress during aging and this could impair the downstream signaling and the maintenance of the cellular energy balance and the stress resistance. However, several diseases have been related with an AMPK dysfunction. Alterations in AMPK signaling decrease mitochondrial biogenesis, increase cellular stress and induce inflammation, which are typical events of the aging process and have been associated to several pathological processes. In this sense, in the last few years AMPK has been identified as a very interesting target and different nutraceutical compounds are being studied for an interesting potential effect on AMPK induction. In this review, we will evaluate the interaction of the different nutraceutical compounds to induce the AMPK phosphorylation and the applications in diseases such as cancer, type II diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases or cardiovascular diseases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e6e","authors":["Fabiola Mar\u00edn-Aguilar","Luis Pavillard","Francesca Giampieri","Pedro Bull\u00f3n","Mario Cordero"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijms18020288","first_seen_on":"2017-01-29T03:48:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1422-0067"],"issue":"2","journal":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1485661242,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/18\/2\/288?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/18\/2\/288?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/18\/2\/288\/pdf","pmid":"28146060","pubdate":"2017-01-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Adenosine Monophosphate (AMP)-Activated Protein Kinase: A New Target for Nutraceutical Compounds","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adenosine-monophosphate-ampactivated-protein-kinase-new-target-nutraceutical-compounds"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8148366,"mean":6.8920487793494,"rank":4323971,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2256306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8148366,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262829,"mean":12.810972346934,"rank":149943,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":86916,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262829,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5169,"mean":2.3716079721362,"rank":1937,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2623,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5169,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":580,"mean":2.2382694300518,"rank":241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":243,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":580,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
