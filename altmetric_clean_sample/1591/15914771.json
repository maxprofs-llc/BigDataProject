This study aimed to determine the mechanisms leading to high-level meropenem resistance in six carbapenemase-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and seven carbapenemase-positive isolates from patients suffering from hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). MICs were determined in the absence or presence of l-arginine or glycine-glutamate as competitive substrates for OprD (OccD1) or OpdP (OccD3), respectively, or the efflux pump inhibitor Phe-Arg \u03b2-naphthylamide (PA\u03b2N). \u03b2-Lactamases were screened by phenotypic tests and\/or PCR. The oprD gene and its promoter were sequenced; protein expression was evidenced by SDS-PAGE. mexA, mexX, mexC and mexE transcripts were evaluated by real-time and semiquantitative PCR. Meropenem\/imipenem MICs were 64-128\/16-32\u2009mg\/L and 128\/128-256\u2009mg\/L in CF and HAP isolates, respectively; PA\u03b2N reduced meropenem MICs to 4-16\u2009mg\/L only and specifically in CF isolates; porin competitors had no effect on MICs. All isolates showed an increase in transcription levels of mexA, mexX and\/or mexC and mutations in oprD leading to production of truncated proteins. AmpC-type cephalosporinases were overexpressed in CF isolates and VIM-2 was expressed in HAP isolates. Antibiotic exclusion from bacteria by concomitant efflux and reduced uptake is sufficient to confer high-level resistance to meropenem in isolates overexpressing AmpC-type cephalosporinases. As efflux is preponderant in these isolates, it confers a paradoxical phenotype where meropenem is less active than imipenem. Concomitant susceptibility testing of both carbapenems and rapid elucidation of the most probable resistance mechanisms is thus warranted.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b19","authors":["Hussein Chalhoub","Yolanda S\u00e1enz","Hector Rodriguez-Villalobos","Olivier Denis","Barbara C.
