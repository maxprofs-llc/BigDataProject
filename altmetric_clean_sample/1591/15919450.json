However, the response of gut microbiota to acarbose is important, as the microbiota may have a critical role in the development of metabolic diseases, and acarbose is metabolized exclusively within the gastrointestinal tract. We explored the changes in the proportion and diversity of gut microbiota before and after treatment with acarbose in patients with prediabetes.\nWe designed a randomized, double-blind, controlled crossover trial in which 52 Chinese patients with prediabetes by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with a BMI of 18-35\u00a0kg\/m(2) were randomly allocated to treatment with acarbose or placebo. Gut microbiota characterizations were determined with 16S rDNA-based high-throughput sequencing.\nOf the 52 participants who entered the study, 40 (76.9%) completed the protocol. On the basis of the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) profiles, a total of 107 OTUs were significantly altered after acarbose treatment, with 76 (71%) assigned to the order of Clostridiales. Ruminococcaceae (15 OTUs) and Lachnospiraceae (22 OTUs) decreased in response to acarbose, and 48 OTUs increased by 12.8-fold, including Lactobacillaceae (8 of 9 belonging to Lactobacillus), Ruminococcaceae (6 of 11 belonging to Faecalibacterium), and Veillonellaceae (8 of 15 belonging to Dialister). At genera level, five flourished after treatment with acarbose, including Lactobacillus and Dialister, while Butyricicoccus, Phascolarctobacterium, and Ruminococcus were inhibited.\nThis study suggests that the benefits of acarbose for T2DM may correlate with the selective modulation of the gut microbiota.\nChinese Clinical Trial Register number, ChiCTR-TTRCC-13004112.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007100","authors":["Xiuying Zhang","Zhiwei Fang","Chunfang Zhang","Huihua Xia","Zhuye Jie","Xueyao Han","Yingli Chen","Linong Ji"],"doi":"10.1007\/s13300-017-0226-y","first_seen_on":"2017-01-29T08:05:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1869-6953","1869-6961"],"journal":"Diabetes Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1485791760,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs13300-017-0226-y","https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s13300-017-0226-y","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs13300-017-0226-y?utm_content=buffer79c75&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs13300-017-0226-y.pdf","pmid":"28130771","pubdate":"2017-01-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Healthcare","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Diabetes","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Endocrinology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"title":"Effects of Acarbose on the Gut Microbiota of Prediabetic Patients: A Randomized, Double-blind, Controlled Crossover Trial","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s13300-017-0226-y","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-acarbose-gut-microbiota-prediabetic-patients-randomized-doubleblind-controlled-crossover-tri-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.58,"score_history":{"1y":8.58,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.58},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8154803,"mean":6.8922645386048,"rank":998874,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7154192,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8154803,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263079,"mean":12.803320270034,"rank":48738,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":214120,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263079,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268,"mean":2.8731535580524,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":249,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":3.6148148148148,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":2,"DK":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Microbiome_Art\/statuses\/825615721279414276","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15919450],"posted_on":"2017-01-29T08:05:01+00:00","author":{"name":"Microbiome Articles","url":"https:\/\/maximeborry.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/778305348469919744\/Kq4NuIyd_normal.jpg","description":"A bot retrieving and twitting all the latest Microbiome articles from PubMed.\nMade by @notmaxib","id_on_source":"Microbiome_Art","tweeter_id":"778208387754582018","geo":{"lt":48.84598,"ln":2.20289,"country":"FR"},"followers":409},"tweet_id":"825615721279414276"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/tulika2709\/statuses\/825821437583773696","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15919450],"posted_on":"2017-01-29T21:42:28+00:00","author":{"name":"Tulika","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/421002556072927232\/ERkVmEOv_normal.jpeg","description":"Post Doc, research on #gut #microbiota and #metabolic #diseases.
