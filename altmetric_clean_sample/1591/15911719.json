We analyzed long-term immune reconstitution (IR) and T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire diversity in 10 SSc patients, with at least 6\u00a0years simultaneous clinical and immunological follow-up after aHSCT. Patients were retrospectively classified as long-term responders (A, n\u2009=\u20095) or non-responders (B, n\u2009=\u20095), using modified Rodnan's skin score (mRSS) and forced vital capacity (FVC%). All patients had similar severe SSc before aHSCT. Number of reinjected CD34(+) cells was higher in group B versus A (P\u2009=\u20090.02). Long-term mRSS fall >25% was more pronounced in group A (P\u2009=\u20090.004), the only to improve long-term FVC% >10% (P\u2009=\u20090.026). There was an overall trend toward increased of T cell reconstitution in group B versus A. B cells had a positive linear regression slope in group A (LRS\u2009=\u200911.1) and negative in group B (LRS\u2009=\u2009-11.6). TCR repertoire was disturbed before aHSCT and the percentage of polyclonal families significantly increased at long-term (P\u2009=\u20090.046), with no difference between groups. Despite improved skin score after aHSCT in all SSc patients, pretransplant B cell clonal expansion and faster post-transplant T cell IR in long-term non-responder\/relapsing patients call for new therapeutic protocols guided by IR analysis to improve their outcome.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000853","authors":["Dominique Farge","Lucas C.
