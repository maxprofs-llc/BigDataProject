Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are a family of essential factors that regulate animal development and physiology; however, their role in cetacean evolution is not clearly understood. Here, we sequenced the fin whale genome and analysed FGFs from 8 cetaceans. FGF22, a hair follicle-enriched gene, exhibited pseudogenization, indicating that the function of this gene is no longer necessary in cetaceans that have lost most of their body hair. An evolutionary analysis revealed signatures of positive selection for FGF3 and FGF11, genes related to ear and tooth development and hypoxia, respectively. We found a D203G substitution in cetacean FGF9, which was predicted to affect FGF9 homodimerization, suggesting that this gene plays a role in the acquisition of rigid flippers for efficient manoeuvring. Cetaceans utilize low bone density as a buoyancy control mechanism, but the underlying genes are not known. We found that the expression of FGF23, a gene associated with reduced bone density, is greatly increased in the cetacean liver under hypoxic conditions, thus implicating FGF23 in low bone density in cetaceans. Altogether, our results provide novel insights into the roles of FGFs in cetacean adaptation to the aquatic environment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Kiwoong Nam","Kyeong Won Lee","Oksung Chung","Hyung-Soon Yim","Sun-Shin Cha","Sae-Won Lee","JeHoon Jun","Yun Sung Cho","Jong Bhak","Jo\u00e3o Pedro de Magalh\u00e3es","Jung-Hyun Lee","Jae-Yeon Jeong"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep40233","first_seen_on":"2017-01-11T17:43:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1487744796,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep40233"],"pmid":"28074842","pubdate":"2017-01-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Computational models","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Molecular evolution","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"40233","subjects":["science"],"title":"Analysis of the FGF gene family provides insights into aquatic adaptation in cetaceans","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep40233","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/analysis-fgf-gene-family-provides-insights-aquatic-adaptation-cetaceans"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.1,"score_history":{"1y":5.1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8255097,"mean":6.9732502228862,"rank":1579616,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6669673,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8255097,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268567,"mean":12.547025371789,"rank":70324,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":197946,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268567,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35329,"mean":14.790982506794,"rank":9785,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":25503,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35329,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3272,"mean":16.434219504739,"rank":1033,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":2237,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3272,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":4,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":4,"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
