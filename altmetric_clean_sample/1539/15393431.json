Although revenue generation is important for the viability of health services, effects on utilization and on equity of access to health care must also be considered. The authors present a logistic regression model to derive price elasticities of demand for health care based on cross-sectional survey data. While demand for health care appears inelastic overall (-0.79), subgroup analysis reveals differences in elasticity across age and income groups. Elasticities of demand for infants and children (-3.6 and -1.7) and for the lowest income quartile (-1.4) are substantially greater than overall elasticity. The method used is unusual in that it allows estimation of elasticities before the introduction of user fees. This increases the value of the information to policy makers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5933cf058f610004f68","authors":["RAINER SAUERBORN","ADRIEN NOUGTARA","ERIC LATIMER"],"doi":"10.1093\/heapol\/9.2.185","endpage":"192","first_seen_on":"2017-01-11T19:20:24+00:00","issns":["0268-1080","1460-2237"],"issue":"2","journal":"Health Policy & Planning","last_mentioned_on":1136073600,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/heapol\/9.2.185"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/heapol.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/9\/2\/185.full.pdf","pmid":"15726780","pubdate":"1994-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Policy And Administration","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"185","subjects":["healthservicesresearch","publichealth"],"title":"The elasticity of demand for health care in Burkina Faso: differences across age and income groups","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/elasticity-demand-health-care-burkina-faso-differences-across-age-income-groups"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6944472,"mean":6.2266552052679,"rank":1621163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":4535120,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6944472,"percentile":65},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96397,"mean":10.924947777916,"rank":29010,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":66061,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96397,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":983,"mean":6.5994052953157,"rank":467,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":293,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":983,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":7.38,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
