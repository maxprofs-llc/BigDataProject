During the course of more than 40 years, the approach to classification of hematological malignancies has evolved from descriptive approaches, based on either cytological or clinical features, to a modern approach, which incorporates cutting-edge technologies. My philosophy has focused on defining individual diseases, an approach that can best lead to an understanding of molecular pathogenesis. To quote Carolus Linnaeus (1, p. 19), the father of taxonomy, \"The first step in wisdom is to know the things themselves; this notion consists in having a true idea of the objects; objects are distinguished and known by classifying them methodically and giving them appropriate names. Therefore, classification and name-giving will be the foundation of our science.\" Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Pathology: Mechanisms of Disease Volume 12 is January 24, 2017.
