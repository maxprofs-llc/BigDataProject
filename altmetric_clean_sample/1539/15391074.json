Because resistance to SP has increased, particularly in eastern and southern Africa, SP is no longer recommended for treatment of acute malaria illness, even in combination with artemisinins. Despite this, even in areas where the efficacy of SP to clear parasitemia has clearly decreased, IPTp-SP has continued to show benefit for preventing low birthweight.(5) Moreover, no other antimalarials have yet been shown to be an ideal replacement for SP for IPTp. Studies evaluating potential alternative IPTp regimens have had mixed outcomes on birthweight,(6,7) leading to the hypothesis that SP may exert some of its effect through antibacterial or anti-inflammatory actions.(6) In Lusaka, Zambia, where malaria parasite prevalence is < 1%, Stoner and others show that among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive women, receipt of IPTp-SP was associated with a dose-dependent reduction in the risk of low birthweight, as well as an increase in gestational age, further suggesting a mechanism other than antimalarial activity as an explanation for a reduced risk of low birthweight among women receiving IPTp-SP during pregnancy (Stoner and others).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006990","authors":["Julie Gutman","Laurence Slutsker"],"doi":"10.4269\/ajtmh.16-0888","first_seen_on":"2017-01-11T16:54:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1476-1645","0002-9637"],"journal":"The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene","last_mentioned_on":1485771056,"links":["http:\/\/www.ajtmh.org\/content\/96\/1\/9?etoc","http:\/\/www.ajtmh.org\/content\/96\/1\/9.long","http:\/\/m.ajtmh.org\/content\/96\/1\/9.long"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ajtmh.org\/content\/96\/1\/9.full.pdf","pmid":"27994102","pubdate":"2017-01-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Intermittent Preventive Treatment with Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine: More than Just an Antimalarial?","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.ajtmh.org\/lookup\/doi\/10.4269\/ajtmh.16-0888","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intermittent-preventive-treatment-sulfadoxinepyrimethamine-more-just-antimalarial"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":2.1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8154593,"mean":6.8923629076653,"rank":3489873,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4629425,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8154593,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260470,"mean":12.712521298119,"rank":109249,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":149203,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260470,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4431,"mean":5.0658803611738,"rank":3120,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1295,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4431,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82,"mean":4.9498271604938,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
