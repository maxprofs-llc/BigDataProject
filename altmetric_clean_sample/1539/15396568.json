Design This multicentre survey (SUSPIRIUM) was designed to evaluate: the prevalence of COPD in stable CHF and CHF in stable COPD; diagnostic\/therapeutic work-up for concurrent COPD\u2009+\u2009CHF; clinical profile of patients with COPD\u2009+\u2009CHF; predictors of COPD in CHF and CHF in COPD. Methods A 5-month-long cross-sectional prospective observational survey was conducted in 10 cardiac and 10 respiratory connected outpatient units. Results The prevalence of CHF in the 378 surveyed COPD patients was 11.9% (95% confidence interval 8.8-16.6) and the prevalence of COPD in 375 CHF patients was 31.5% (95% confidence interval 26.8-36.4). Diagnostic tests for suspected comorbidity were prescribed in 21.6% and 22.9% of COPD and CHF patients, respectively. Patients with coexisting CHF\u2009+\u2009COPD had a higher incidence of hypertension, physical inactivity and more frequently a GOLD score of 3 or greater. Compared to CHF only, CHF\u2009+\u2009COPD patients were significantly older, more frequently smokers, at worse respiratory risk and in a higher New York Heart Association class. Conversely, hypercholesterolaemia, a family history of ischaemic heart disease, fluid retention and comorbidities were more frequent in COPD\u2009+\u2009CHF than COPD-only patients. At multivariate analysis, a GOLD score of 3 or greater in CHF strongly predicted coexistent COPD (odds ratio 8.985, P\u2009<\u20090.0001) as did a history of other respiratory diseases (5.184, P\u2009<\u20090.0001). A history of ischaemic heart disease (4.868, P\u2009<\u20090.0001), atrial fibrillation (3.302, P\u2009<\u20090.0001) and sedentary lifestyle (2.814, P\u2009<\u20090.004) predicted coexistent CHF in COPD. Conclusion The high prevalence of COPD\u2009+\u2009CHF calls for integrated disease management between cardiologists and pulmonologists. SUSPIRIUM identifies which cardiac\/pulmonary outpatients should be screened for the respective comorbidity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f61000736a","authors":["Griffo, Raffaele","Spanevello, Antonio","Temporelli, Pier Luigi","Faggiano, Pompilio","Carone, Mauro","Magni, Giovanna","Ambrosino, Nicolino","Tavazzi, Luigi",", ","Raffaele Griffo","Antonio Spanevello","Pier Luigi Temporelli","Pompilio Faggiano","Mauro Carone","Giovanna Magni","Nicolino Ambrosino","Luigi Tavazzi"],"doi":"10.1177\/2047487316687425","first_seen_on":"2017-01-11T21:47:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2047-4881","2047-4873"],"journal":"European Journal of Preventive Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1503679809,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28067533\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28067533"],"pmid":"28067533","pubdate":"2017-01-09T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"204748731668742","subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Frequent coexistence of chronic heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in respiratory and cardiac outpatients: Evidence from SUSPIRIUM, a multicentre Italian survey","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/frequent-coexistence-chronic-heart-failure-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-respiratory-cardiac"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.05,"score_history":{"1y":4.05,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8425604,"mean":7.0878923279354,"rank":1852813,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":6565427,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8425604,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":277927,"mean":12.436081957067,"rank":82895,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":194562,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":277927,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":688,"mean":17.009077147016,"rank":198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":488,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":688,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":74.746666666667,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"US":1},"mendeley":{"BR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JaneScullion\/statuses\/819472395887136768","license":"gnip","rt":["Inspire4lifeorg"],"citation_ids":[15396568],"posted_on":"2017-01-12T09:13:38+00:00","author":{"name":"Jane E Scullion","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1729305518\/image_normal.jpg","description":"Nurse first and foremost.
