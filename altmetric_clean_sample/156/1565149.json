We call these 'recommending' and 'option-listing'. The former entails making a proposal to do something; the latter entails the construction of a list of options. Using conversation analysis (CA), we illustrate each, showing that the distinction between these two practices matters to participants. Our analysis centres on two distinctions between the practices: epistemic differences and differences in the slots each creates for the patient's response. Considering the implications of our findings for understanding medical authority, we argue that option-listing - relative to recommending - is a practice whereby clinicians work to relinquish a little of their authority. This article contributes, then, to a growing body of CA work that offers a more nuanced, tempered account of medical authority than is typically portrayed in the sociological literature. We argue that future CA studies should map out the range of ways - in addition to recommending - in which treatment decision-making is initiated by clinicians. This will allow for further evidence-based contributions to debates on the related concepts of patient participation, choice, shared decision-making and medical authority.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f610003571","authors":["Toerien M","Shaw R","Reuber M","Toerien, Merran","Shaw, Rebecca","Reuber, Markus","Merran Toerien","Rebecca Shaw","Markus Reuber"],"doi":"10.1111\/1467-9566.12000","endpage":"890","first_seen_on":"2013-06-18T13:56:10+00:00","issns":["1467-9566","0141-9889","01419889"],"issue":"6","journal":"Sociology of Health & Illness","last_mentioned_on":1371649872,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1467-9566.12000\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1467-9566.12000\/pdf","pmid":"23550963","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Sociology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"History And Philosophy Of Specific Fields","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"873","subjects":["socialsciences"],"title":"Initiating decision\u00e2\u0080\u0090making in neurology consultations: recommending versus option\u00e2\u0080\u0090listing and the implications for medical authority","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/1467-9566.12000","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/initiating-decisionmaking-neurology-consultations-recommending-versus-optionlisting-implications-med"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6382107,"mean":5.9844908151009,"rank":2616574,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3623660,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6382107,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101007,"mean":7.3856133695028,"rank":41838,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":55894,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101007,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":602,"mean":5.6817071547421,"rank":342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":602,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
