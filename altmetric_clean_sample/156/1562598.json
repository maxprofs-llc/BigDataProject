In an effort to evaluate the potential risks to potable water quality, the present study is devoted to experimental investigation of the effects of CO2 intrusion on the mobility of toxic ions in simplified equilibrated aquifers. We demonstrate that remobilization of trace elements by CO2 intrusion is not a universal physicochemical effect. In fact goethite and calcite, two minerals frequently found in aquifers, could successfully prevent the remobilization of adsorbed Cu(II), Cd(II), Se(IV), and As(V) if CO2 is intruded into a drinking water aquifer. Furthermore, a decrease in pH resulting from CO2 intrusion could reactivate the adsorption of Se(IV) and As(V) if goethite and calcite are sufficiently available in underground layers. Our results also suggest that adsorption of cadmium and copper could be promoted by calcite dissolution. These adsorbed ions on calcite are not remobilized when CO2 is intruded into the system, but it intensifies calcite dissolution. On the other hand, arsenite As(III) is significantly adsorbed on goethite, but is partially remobilized by CO2 intrusion.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027ef","authors":["German Montes-Hernandez"],"doi":"10.1021\/es3053448","first_seen_on":"2013-06-17T19:00:34+00:00","issns":["0013-936X"],"journal":"Environmental Science & Technology","last_mentioned_on":1371495615,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/es3053448"],"pmid":"23725478","pubdate":"2013-06-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Experimental Assessment of CO2-Mineral-Toxic Ion Interactions in a Simplified Freshwater Aquifer: Implications for CO2 Leakage from Deep Geological Storage","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/experimental-assessment-co2mineraltoxic-ion-interactions-simplified-freshwater-aquifer-implications"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3072682,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":950172,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89743,"mean":7.3036857881484,"rank":61585,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":17257,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89743,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4705,"mean":8.4227104591837,"rank":3635,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":638,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4705,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":247,"mean":9.7086666666667,"rank":198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":247,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
