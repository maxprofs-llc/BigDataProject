Follow-up visits took place at 3 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year after the first corticosteroid injection. Thirty of the 120 patients (25%) had a good outcome with a single injection, 11 additional patients (9%) needed a second injection, and five patients (4%) needed a third injection to reach a good outcome after 1 year. Of patients with an initial good treatment response, 28 (52%) had a good outcome after 1 year compared with 18 (27 %) who had an initially moderate or no response to treatment. One-third of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome had a long-term beneficial effect from corticosteroid injection, especially when they had a good initial response.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008e4f","authors":["M.
