Studying how human groups adapt and create new livelihoods strategies are important research topics for creating policies in natural resources management. Here, we study the adoption and development of lagartos (Crocodylus moreletii) commercial hunting by Mayan people from a communal land in Quintana Roo state. Two questions guided our work: how did the Mayan learn to hunt lagartos? And how, and in what context, did knowledge and management practices emerge? We believe that social structures, knowledge and preexisting skills facilitate the hunting learning process, but lagarto ecological knowledge and organizational practice were developed in a \"learning by doing\" process.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000084f","authors":["Fernando Zamudio","Eduardo Bello-Baltazar","Erin IJ Estrada-Lugo"],"doi":"10.1186\/1746-4269-9-35","first_seen_on":"2013-06-18T20:01:53+00:00","issns":[""],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine","last_mentioned_on":1374013941,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3680167\/?report=classic"],"pmid":"23706104","pubdate":"2013-06-18T20:13:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary & Alternative Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Social Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"35","subjects":["medicine","socialsciences"],"title":"Learning to hunt Crocodiles: social organization in the process of knowledge generation and the emergence of management practices among Mayan of Mexico","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/learning-hunt-crocodiles-social-organization-process-knowledge-generation-emergence-management-pract"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":3555561,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":834033,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94007,"mean":7.4362024977131,"rank":63969,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":15789,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94007,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":389,"mean":3.3062164948454,"rank":306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":389,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":3.3081176470588,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
