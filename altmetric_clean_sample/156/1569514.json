Placental dysfunction and increased inflammation are believed to underlie the pathogenesis of severe preeclampsia (PE), which may involve IL-6-induced signaling. We investigate whether the changes in the expression of IL-6 and its cognate receptors, IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and glycoprotein (gp)130, occur between early and late onset severe PE.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5263cf058f610003d53","authors":["Zhan Zhang","Yan Gao","Linlin Zhang","Liting Jia","Peng Wang","Lin Zhang","He Li"],"doi":"10.3109\/10641955.2013.798332","endpage":"11","first_seen_on":"2013-06-20T03:44:25+00:00","issns":["1064-1955","1525-6065"],"journal":"Hypertension in Pregnancy","last_mentioned_on":1371699832,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/10641955.2013.798332","http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/10641955.2013.798332?ai=1lne&mi=3gfofr&af=R&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed&"],"pmid":"23782174","pubdate":"2013-06-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["obstetrics"],"title":"Alterations of IL-6, IL-6R and gp130 in early and late onset severe preeclampsia.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alterations-il6-il6r-gp130-early-late-onset-severe-preeclampsia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3072571,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":950066,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89357,"mean":7.3248913559248,"rank":61311,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":17210,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89357,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92,"mean":0.95989010989011,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.625,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Ph.
