In a number of countries, pepper spray is being used by police forces to aid in arresting aggressive individuals. Pepper spray is commercially available as a canister filled with Capsicum extract, which contains capsaicin as the active component. When applied in the form of a spray, it causes an acute inflammation, and humans involuntarily close their eyes, experience a burning feeling on the skin, and are usually rapidly incapacitated. Use by the U.S. police was successful in subduing aggressive individuals in 90% of cases, and a reduction of injury to both police and arrested individuals was noted. In general, pepper spray appeared to be a relatively safe weapon with small risk of causing acute physical harm. Despite this evidence, a number of fatalities were reported in the United States following the use of pepper spray. However, it was concluded that it was not the pepper spray but rather other factors such as drugs and hog-tying that contributed to the cause of death. In only 1 case, that of an asthmatic man, was it concluded that the use of pepper spray contributed to the cause of death. Much attention has been paid to possible genotoxic effects of Capsicum extract such as mutagenicity and carcinogenicity. It was concluded that the risk of long-term health effects is negligible. Because pepper spray may induce bronchoconstriction, people suffering from chronic obstructive lung disease may be hypersensitive to it. Although the results of one study indicate that asthmatics do not develop additional bronchoconstriction following inhalation of capsaicin, the number of experimental data are too few to draw sound conclusions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f610006975","authors":["Busker, R W","van Helden, H P"],"first_seen_on":"2013-06-17T07:45:55+00:00","issns":["0195-7910"],"issue":"4","journal":"The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1371651240,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9885922"],"pmid":"9885922","pubdate":"1998-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology","jurisprudence"],"title":"Toxicologic evaluation of pepper spray as a possible weapon for the Dutch police force: risk assessment and efficacy.","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/toxicologic-evaluation-pepper-spray-possible-weapon-dutch-police-force-risk-assessment-efficacy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.704,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.704},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685758,"mean":4.9523304688866,"rank":369725,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":3316072,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685758,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85930,"mean":7.0938504579361,"rank":11536,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":74390,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85930,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":391,"mean":2.4546871794872,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":361,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":391,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.745,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
