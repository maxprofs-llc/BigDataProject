First line therapy consists of low dose aspirin and heparin. Despite conventional therapy some women fail to achieve a successful pregnancy outcome. We describe the case of a patient who had two live births following intravenous immunoglobulin therapy despite previous failure with conventional therapy for RPL in the setting of APS. We will summarize the available literature on intravenous immunoglobulin for this indication.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5303cf058f6100042c5","authors":["Jacklyn Chay","Karin Lust","Paul Kubler","Leonie Callaway"],"doi":"10.1177\/1753495x12472644","endpage":"79","first_seen_on":"2013-06-16T21:48:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1753-4968","1753-495X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Obstetric Medicine (1753-495X)","last_mentioned_on":1371419278,"links":["http:\/\/obm.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2013\/05\/03\/1753495X12472644.full.pdf+html"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/obm.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2013\/05\/03\/1753495X12472644.full.pdf","pmid":"27757161","pubdate":"2013-05-20T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"76","title":"When conventional treatment fails: the role of intravenous immunoglobulin in recurrent pregnancy loss secondary to antiphospholipid syndrome","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/conventional-treatment-fails-role-intravenous-immunoglobulin-recurrent-pregnancy-loss-secondary-anti"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":2293471,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1621198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82279,"mean":7.6589880162378,"rank":41475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":29685,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82279,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":2.6577272727273,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Professor":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/APSFA\/statuses\/346383674704547840","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1560678],"posted_on":"2013-06-16T21:47:58+00:00","author":{"name":"APS Fndn of America","url":"http:\/\/www.apsfa.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/328582648\/twitterProfilePhoto_normal.jpg","description":"APS Foundation of America, Inc ( #APSFA ) is the only US organization spreading #Antiphospholipid Syndrome #APS & #Lupus #Awareness!  #DVT #PE #Stroke #APS","id_on_source":"APSFA","tweeter_id":"17492469","geo":{"lt":39.76,"ln":-98.5,"country":"US"},"followers":1489},"tweet_id":"346383674704547840"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/eyzrbrn\/statuses\/346383676449366017","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1560678],"posted_on":"2013-06-16T21:47:58+00:00","author":{"name":"Tina \ud83d\ude0a\u270c\u2744 \u2764\ud83d\udc31 \ud83d\udca6\ud83c\udf1e\u267b\ufe0f","url":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Tina.M.Pohlman","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/865967190025142273\/qflPBQIA_normal.jpg","description":"#Lupus, #APS, #RA & #CKD suck. #Paranormal Junkie!
