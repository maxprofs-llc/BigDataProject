The medical lexicon is characterized by a notable terminological richness both in Italian and in English, and the same is true for legal English, which has included, through time, a number of terms deriving from Latin and French. This scientific contribution highlights some features of medical-scientific English and legal English, pointing out certain similarities and the differences between the two. Furthermore, with reference to the differences, a selection of terms with the same orthographical form but with very different lexical meanings is here presented.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007fbe","authors":["Conti AA"],"first_seen_on":"2013-06-18T16:26:35+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"3","journal":"La Clinica Terapeutica","last_mentioned_on":1371572930,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22964707"],"pmid":"22964707","pubdate":"2012-09-13T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["drugtherapy"],"title":"[Medical English and legal English: similarities and differences between two specialist languages.]","type":"article","volume":"163"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629240,"mean":4.9358355666342,"rank":1530354,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":1999903,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629240,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85322,"mean":7.1310205693793,"rank":30887,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":52247,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85322,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96,"mean":1.3799789473684,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":76,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.1916666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SLCLtd\/statuses\/347027526041866240","license":"public","citation_ids":[1565512],"posted_on":"2013-06-18T16:26:24+00:00","author":{"name":"SLC","url":"http:\/\/www.specialistlanguagecourses.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/618433608039006208\/cIiDggE9_normal.jpg","description":"SLC is an international Technical and Business Language Training Consultancy","id_on_source":"SLCLtd","tweeter_id":"475961364","geo":{"lt":50.82838,"ln":-0.13947,"country":"GB"},"followers":611},"tweet_id":"347027526041866240"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/tstewart140\/statuses\/347028140616474625","license":"public","citation_ids":[1565512],"posted_on":"2013-06-18T16:28:50+00:00","author":{"name":"Tom it is.","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/868555426522071041\/yvzPzNLi_normal.jpg","description":"Linguist, birder, lapsed bowler, #Gaelic enthusiast.\nUnabashed #INTP, if that's possible.","id_on_source":"tstewart140","tweeter_id":"1146444073","geo":{"lt":38.25424,"ln":-85.75941,"country":"US"},"followers":780},"tweet_id":"347028140616474625"}]}}
