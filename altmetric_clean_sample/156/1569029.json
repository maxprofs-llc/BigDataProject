SAMP8 mice without treatment were used as the AD-positive control, and senescence-accelerated-resistant mice were used as the AD-negative control. In this study, 4-month-old male SAMP8 mice were orally administered 25 and 50\u00a0mg\/kg RHL in drinking water for 6 months. The results of brain tissue enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunohistochemistry, and Western blot were demonstrated that compared with SAMP8 group, \u03b2-amyloid1-40 and \u03b2-amyloid1-42 were reduced; the levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin 6 of brain tissues were also significantly decreased; however, the level of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) was increased in the RHL-treated group. Compared with SAMP8 group, the ROS levels and malondialdehyde levels were decreased; however, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase levels were increased in the brain tissues of SAMP8 25 and 50\u00a0mg\/kg RHL-treated groups. In conclusion, the reduction of A\u03b2 induced by RHL was related to the increase of SIRT1 and the inhibition of the inflammatory response and oxidative stress in SAMP8 mice. It might be a promising biological therapeutic drug for AD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d73cf058f61000119d","authors":["Jiang Liu","Gang Hu","Rong Xu","Yue Qiao","He-Ping Wu","Xun Ding","Peng Duan","Ping Tu","Ya-Jun Lin","Liu J","Hu G","Xu R","Qiao Y","Wu HP","Ding X","Duan P","Tu P","Lin YJ"],"doi":"10.1080\/10286020.2013.800972","endpage":"8","first_seen_on":"2013-06-20T00:38:52+00:00","issns":["1028-6020","1477-2213"],"journal":"Journal of Asian Natural Products Research","last_mentioned_on":1371688679,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/10286020.2013.800972","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/10286020.2013.800972?ai=2gl&mi=6ksfke&af=R"],"pmid":"23777400","pubdate":"2013-06-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["chemistry","botany"],"title":"Rhein lysinate decreases the generation of \u03b2-amyloid in the brain tissues of Alzheimer's disease model mice by inhibiting inflammatory response and oxidative stress","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rhein-lysinate-decreases-generation-%CE%B2amyloid-brain-tissues-alzheimers-disease-model-mice-inhibiting"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6230816,"mean":5.9681228064084,"rank":2927340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1858866,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6230816,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99192,"mean":7.4485409563368,"rank":49409,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":36340,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99192,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179,"mean":1.2644943820225,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":2.04,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
