For patients with uveitis, disease activity (active vs. inactive) and grade of inflammation were recorded according to Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature criteria. The level of VA impairment was categorized according to World Health Organization classification for VA impairment as follows: normal\/mild, VA 20\/70 or better; moderate, VA 20\/70-20\/200; severe, VA 20\/200-20\/400; blindness, VA <20\/400. Visual acuity, length of ETU stay, and structural complications were compared between EVD survivors with and without uveitis. Structural complications associated with moderate VA impairment or poorer were analyzed.\nFrequency of ocular complications including uveitis and optic neuropathy in EVD survivors, level of VA impairment in EVD survivors with uveitis, and structural complications associated with VA impairment in EVD survivors.\nA total of 96 survivors of EVD were examined. A total of 21 patients developed an EVD-associated uveitis, and 3 patients developed an EVD-associated optic neuropathy. Visual acuity was blind (VA >20\/400) in 38.5% of eyes with uveitis. Anatomic subtypes of uveitis included anterior, posterior, and panuveitis in 2, 13, and 6 patients, respectively. Examination findings associated with at least moderate visual impairment by World Health Organization criteria (VA <20\/70) included keratic precipitates (P < 0.002), posterior synechiae (P < 0.002), vitritis (P < 0.005), and chorioretinal scars (P < 0.02).\nSurvivors of EVD are at risk for uveitis, which may lead to secondary structural complications, visual impairment, and blindness. Eye care resources should be mobilized for EVD survivors in West Africa because of the frequency of this spectrum of disease complication and its potential for severe VA impairment and blindness.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003250","authors":["Shantha, Jessica G","Crozier, Ian","Hayek, Brent R","Bruce, Beau B","Gargu, Catherine","Brown, Jerry","Fankhauser, John","Yeh, Steven","Jessica G.
