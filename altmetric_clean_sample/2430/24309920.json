In this study, we report a investigation of a protic \"Deep Eutectic Solvent\" (DES) consisting on mixture of Lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide salt (LiFSI) with formamide (FMD) as H-bond donor (xLiFSI = 0.25 ; C = 2.5 M LiFSI) as electrolyte for AC based EDLC. Physical characterization of viscosity, conductivity and ionicity of electrolyte in wide range of temperatures indicate above 88% salt dissociation. The in-situ pressure measurements are focused on understanding the effect of cycling conditions on the rate of gas generation quantified by the in-operando pressure variation (dP\/dt). These measurements demonstrate that about 25% of the faradaic reactions leading to gas generation are electrochemically reversible. Finally, the cell ageing studies demonstrate a promising potential of LiFSI\/FMD as a protic electrolyte for AC based EDLCs and higher energy density close to 30 Wh.kg-1 at 2.4 V.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008dda","authors":["Phadke, Satyajit","Amara, Samia","Anouti, M\u00e9ri\u00e8m"],"doi":"10.1002\/cphc.201700621","first_seen_on":"2017-08-25T17:39:35+00:00","issns":["14394235","1439-7641"],"journal":"ChemPhysChem","last_mentioned_on":1503682762,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cphc.201700621\/abstract;jsessionid=1656E29C58D3871F216C4C4A65A9865D.f04t04"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cphc.201700621\/pdf","pmid":"28707746","pubdate":"2017-08-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
