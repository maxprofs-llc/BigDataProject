Data for use of aprepitant in children is limited and hence aprepitant is not recommended by Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario guidelines for prevention of CIV in children <12\u00a0years.\nA randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at a single center in chemotherapy na\u00efve children (5-18\u00a0years) receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy. All patients received intravenous ondansetron (0.15\u00a0mg\/kg) and dexamethasone (0.15\u00a0mg\/kg) prior to chemotherapy followed by oral ondansetron and dexamethasone. Patients randomly assigned to aprepitant arm received oral aprepitant (15-40\u00a0kg\u2009=\u2009days 1-3, 80\u00a0mg; 41-65\u00a0kg\u2009=\u2009day 1, 125\u00a0mg and days 2-3, 80\u00a0mg) 1\u00a0h before chemotherapy. Control group received placebo as add-on therapy. Primary outcome measure was the incidence of acute moderate to severe vomiting, which was defined as more than two vomiting episodes within 24\u00a0h after the administration of the first chemotherapy dose until 24\u00a0h after the last chemotherapy dose in the block. Complete response (CR) was defined as absence of vomiting and retching during the specified phase.\nOf the 96 randomized patients, three were excluded from analysis; 93 patients were analyzed (50 in aprepitant arm and 43 in placebo arm). Acute moderate and severe vomiting was reported in 72\u00a0% patients receiving placebo and 38\u00a0% patients receiving aprepitant (p\u2009=\u20090.001). Complete response rates during acute phase were significantly higher in aprepitant arm (48 vs. 12\u00a0%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). No major adverse effects were reported by patients\/guardians.\nThis double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial shows that aprepitant significantly decreases the incidence of CIV during acute phase when used as an add-on drug with ondansetron and dexamethasone in children receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100035ed","authors":["Bakhshi, Sameer","Batra, Atul","Biswas, Bivas","Dhawan, Deepa","Paul, Reeja","Sreenivas, Vishnubhatla"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00520-015-2714-9","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T20:33:24+00:00","issns":["1433-7339"],"journal":"Supportive Care in Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1428582267,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25851802?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25851802","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nursing Management\/Nursing Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pain Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Rehabilitation Medicine","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms","healthservices"],"title":"Aprepitant as an add-on therapy in children receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aprepitant-addon-therapy-children-receiving-highly-emetogenic-chemotherapy-randomized-doubleblind-pl-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4977966,"mean":5.8923747639887,"rank":4162176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4977966,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168032,"mean":8.9627052270119,"rank":139075,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168032,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1191,"mean":3.2257915966387,"rank":1007,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1191,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":2.8687796610169,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
