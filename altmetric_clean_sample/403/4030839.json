These workers also have increased exposure to human papilloma viruses (HPV) and certain chemical carcinogens. We investigated whether such a group showed increased risk of cancers. We report mortality results after an additional 9-year follow-up of a previously studied group of 5,522 workers in abattoirs and 4,589 workers in meatpacking plants. Excess risk of all cancers combined, cancers of the lung, buccal cavity and pharynx, esophagus, colon, bladder, kidney, and bone was observed. Since factors such as tobacco smoking, alcohol, and diet, which have known associations with some of these cancers, were not taken into account, the significance of these findings is not known, except for lung cancer, for which occupational factors are probably involved. Because some of these findings have been consistently reported before, studies that will control for confounding factors as well are now urgently needed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f6100064dc","authors":["Johnson, E S","Dalmas, D","Noss, J","Matanoski, G M"],"first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T20:56:24+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["0271-3586"],"issue":"3","journal":"American Journal of Industrial Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1461636660,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7747745"],"pmid":"7747745","pubdate":"1995-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["occupationalmedicine"],"title":"Cancer mortality among workers in abattoirs and meatpacking plants: an update.","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cancer-mortality-among-workers-abattoirs-meatpacking-plants-update"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.922,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.922},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7809560,"mean":6.6301720171336,"rank":785896,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7024490,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7809560,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":216689,"mean":8.4918894355019,"rank":31187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":185502,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":216689,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1974,"mean":5.4871819564116,"rank":107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":1866,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1974,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":4.4065217391304,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
