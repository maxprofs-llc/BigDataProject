Various research data confirm that teachers of the visually impaired do not have sufficient skills to introduce their students to modern devices. The Mountbatten Brailler can be considered as a tool that combines Braille technology with mainstream tools commonly used by students and teachers. This combination of devices opens new possibilities for the teachers and their students to reverse the trend in the use of Braille. Thanks to features offered by the Brailler and iOS devices, sighted and blind users receive a tool for unimpaired written communication.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d73cf058f6100011f1","authors":["Wiazowski, Jaroslaw"],"first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T20:40:13+00:00","issns":["1040-0435"],"issue":"4","journal":"Assistive Technology","last_mentioned_on":1428557898,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25771608?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25771608","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Specialist Studies In Education","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine"],"title":"Can Braille be revived?
