The aim of this study was to assess the incidence rate and risk of deep neck infection among patients who had undergone a tonsillectomy.\nThis retrospective cohort study evaluated all patients who had undergone tonsillectomy between 2001 and 2009 as identified from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. For each post-tonsillectomy patient, 10 age-, sex-, and index date-matched controls without a history of tonsillectomy were randomly selected. Cox Proportional hazard model and propensity score model were performed to evaluate the association between tonsillectomy and deep neck infection after adjusting for demographic and clinical data.\nThere were 34 (71.6 cases per 100,000 person-years) and 174 (36.6 cases per 100,000 person-years) patients that developed deep neck infection in the tonsillectomized and comparison cohorts, respectively. After adjusting for covariates, patients who had undergone a tonsillectomy had a 1.71-fold greater risk of deep neck infection by both Cox proportional hazard model (95% confidence interval, 1.13-2.59) and propensity score model (95% confidence interval, 1.10-2.66). This association was not altered regardless of the indication for tonsillectomy (i.e. chronic\/recurrent tonsillitis or sleep apnea\/hypertrophy of tonsil) (p = 0.9797).\nBased on our review of a nationwide cohort study we identified that the risk of deep neck infection is significantly increased among patients who have undergone a tonsillectomy. Additional research is needed to explore the possible mechanisms behind these findings.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Wang, Ying-Piao","Wang, Mao-Che","Lin, Hung-Ching","Lee, Kuo-Sheng","Chou, Pesus","Ying-Piao Wang","Mao-Che Wang","Hung-Ching Lin","Kuo-Sheng Lee","Pesus Chou","Salomon Amar"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0117535","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T20:51:22+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"4","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1488199795,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25849535?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25849535"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0117535&type=printable","pmid":"25849535","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0117535","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Tonsillectomy and the risk for deep neck infection-a nationwide cohort study.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0117535","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tonsillectomy-risk-deep-neck-infectiona-nationwide-cohort-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8282830,"mean":6.9841686085689,"rank":2034294,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":6209322,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8282830,"percentile":74},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":219580,"mean":8.6935585643437,"rank":65370,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":152953,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":219580,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114661,"mean":10.593387912088,"rank":36621,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":77119,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114661,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6084,"mean":9.5979493670886,"rank":1943,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":4079,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6084,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
