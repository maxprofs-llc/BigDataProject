Many strategies have been proposed and applied for this purpose, yet the void for a functional safe method is still apparent. Since most of the diseases are caused by undesirable upregulation (oncogenes) or downregulation (tumor suppressor genes) of genes, major gene therapy's techniques affect gene expression. Most of the methods are used in post-transcriptional level such as RNA inhibitory (RNAi) and splice-switching oligonucleotides (SSOs). RNAi blocks messenger RNA (mRNA) translation by mRNA degradation or interruption between attachments of mRNA with ribosomes' subunits. However, one of the novel methods is the usage of transcription factor targeted decoys. DNA decoys are the new generation of functional gene downregulatory oligonucleotides which compete with specific binding sites of transcription factors. Considering the exponential growth of this technique in both in vitro and in vivo studies, in this paper, we aim to line out the description, design, and application of decoys in research and therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008c15","authors":["Rad, Seyed Mohammad Ali Hosseini","Langroudi, Lida","Kouhkan, Fatemeh","Yazdani, Laleh","Koupaee, Alireza Nouri","Asgharpour, Sara","Shojaei, Zahra","Bamdad, Taravat","Arefian, Ehsan"],"doi":"10.1007\/s13277-015-3344-z","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T21:44:23+00:00","issns":["1423-0380"],"journal":"Tumor Biology","last_mentioned_on":1428142267,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25835969?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25835969","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Transcription factor decoy: a pre-transcriptional approach for gene downregulation purpose in cancer.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transcription-factor-decoy-pretranscriptional-approach-gene-downregulation-purpose-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4955669,"mean":5.8723543413346,"rank":2456218,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2349332,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4955669,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167499,"mean":8.9611791066164,"rank":87588,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":72390,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167499,"percentile":43},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1869,"mean":0.88249357601713,"rank":245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":1524,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1869,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94,"mean":0.77311827956989,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":71,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
