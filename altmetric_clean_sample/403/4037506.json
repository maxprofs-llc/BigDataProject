DNA was extracted from protoscoleces removed from hydatid cyst from the liver of a 2-year-old male buffalo slaughtered in Khuzestan province. Molecular and phylogenetic analyses were conducted based on cox1 mitochondrial gene. We found the presence of a new microvariant of G3 genotype for E. granulosus in Iran which is genetically differentiated from reference G3 sequence (M84663). The difference was a transition mutation of adenine to guanine in position 214 (A214G) resulting in a substitution of the threonine (ACT) by alanine (GCT). These findings extend the knowledge of heterogeneity and distribution of G3 genotype for E. granulosus in world.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef5d2a83ee09648b4dd5","authors":["Babazadeh, Marzie","Sharifiyazdi, Hassan","Moazeni, Mohammad","Gorjipour, Sedigheh","Heidari, Mahdi"],"first_seen_on":"2015-05-21T16:59:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2008-8140"],"issue":"1","journal":"Veterinary Research Forum","last_mentioned_on":1432212964,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25992257?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25992257","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Molecular characterization of a new microvariant of the G3 genotype for Echinococcus granulosus in water buffalo in Iran.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-characterization-new-microvariant-g3-genotype-echinococcus-granulosus-water-buffalo-iran"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5128650,"mean":6.0687045960854,"rank":4265338,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5128650,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171656,"mean":8.9965871195131,"rank":141625,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171656,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":0.765625,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
