The role of familial factors was studied in 1705 twin pairs in this cohort who were discordant for weight-loss attempts at baseline. Baseline (1975) and follow-up (1981 and 1990) data-including weight, weight-loss attempts (dieting), and selected confounders-were obtained via mailed questionnaires.\nAverage weight gain was at most weakly associated with weight-loss attempts. The risk of major weight gain for subjects attempting to lose weight at baseline was greatest among initially young (18-29 y) men (over 6 and 15 y, respectively-odds ratios: 2.01 and 1.74; 95% CI: 1.13, 3.57 and 1.11, 2.75) and middle-aged (30-54 y) women (over 6 and 15 y, respectively-2.43 and 1.52; 1.33, 4.42 and 1.06, 2.22) and persisted after potential confounders were controlled for. These risks decreased and became nonsignificant in the pairwise twin analysis, suggesting that the relation between dieting and subsequent major weight gain may also have a familial component.\nWeight-loss attempts may be associated with subsequent major weight gain, even when several potential confounders are controlled for. Genetic and familial factors may contribute to this association.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005700","authors":["Korkeila, M","Rissanen, A","Kaprio, J","Sorensen, T I","Koskenvuo, M","Maarit Korkeila","Aila Rissanen","Jaakko Kaprio","Thorkild IA S\u00f8rensen","Markku Koskenvuo"],"first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T20:25:59+00:00","issns":["0002-9165","1938-3207"],"issue":"6","journal":"American Journal of Clinical Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1483729988,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10584040","http:\/\/ajcn.nutrition.org\/content\/70\/6\/965.long"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ajcn.nutrition.org\/content\/70\/6\/965.full.pdf","pmid":"10584040","pubdate":"1999-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Weight-loss attempts and risk of major weight gain: a prospective study in Finnish adults.","type":"article","volume":"70","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/weightloss-attempts-risk-major-weight-gain-prospective-study-finnish-adults"},"altmetric_score":{"score":17.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":17.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992937,"mean":6.7399601605663,"rank":459469,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7531937,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992937,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":217888,"mean":8.5290536195369,"rank":18141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":199681,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":217888,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5879,"mean":25.479275603947,"rank":1578,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":4296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5879,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106,"mean":49.007257142857,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":63,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
