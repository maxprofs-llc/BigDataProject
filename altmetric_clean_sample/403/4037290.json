Despite its clinical efficacy, up to 30% of patients will ultimately experience progression to muscle-invasive disease. This, along with an improved understanding of the biologic pathways involved, has led to efforts to improve, enhance, or alter the immune response in the treatment of urothelial carcinoma. A number of novel therapeutic approaches currently are being pursued, including recombinant BCG to induce T helper type 1 (Th1) immune responses, nonlive Mycobacterium agents, targeted agents toward cancer-associated antigens, immune-modulating vaccines, and adoptive T-cell therapies. Here, we review the current and future immunotherapy treatment options for patients with urothelial cancer.","authors":["Brancato, Sam J","Lewi, Keidren","Agarwal, Piyush K"],"doi":"10.14694\/edbook_am.2015.35.e284","first_seen_on":"2015-05-21T16:27:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1548-8756"],"journal":"American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book \/ ASCO.
