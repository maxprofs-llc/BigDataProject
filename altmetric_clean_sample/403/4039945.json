Its modulation is achieved through the combinatorial interplay of positive and negative regulatory signals present in the RNA, which are recognized by complexes composed of members of the hnRNP and SR protein families.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036a4","authors":["Smith, C W","Valc\u00e1rcel, J","Christopher W.J Smith","Juan Valc\u00e1rcel"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0968-0004(00)01604-2","endpage":"388","first_seen_on":"2015-05-22T05:02:52+00:00","issns":["0968-0004","09680004"],"issue":"8","journal":"Trends in Biochemical Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1432112022,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0968000400016042"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S0968000400016042\/pdf","pmid":"10916158","pubdate":"2000-01-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"381","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Alternative pre-mRNA splicing: the logic of combinatorial control","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0968000400016042","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alternative-premrna-splicing-logic-combinatorial-control"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5124816,"mean":6.0645817669528,"rank":2705926,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1749961,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5124816,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172270,"mean":8.9830516459724,"rank":98031,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":57274,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172270,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1019,"mean":3.8456758349705,"rank":823,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":120,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1019,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":4.5961538461538,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":17,"Researcher":67,"Student  > Doctoral Student":12,"Student  > Ph.
