The modified electrode was achieved based on electroreduction of graphene oxide on an integrated Pt working electrode of a commercial ME device. The surface modification was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) techniques. The results indicated that graphene sheets were successfully deposited exhibiting higher surface conductivity and greater electrode sensitivity. The performance of the modified electrode for the amperometric detection on ME devices has been demonstrated by the separation and detection of an anionic mixture containing iodide and ascorbate. The graphene-modified electrode provided significantly higher sensitivity (896.7 vs. 210.9 pA \u03bcmol L(-1) for iodide and 217.8 vs. 127.8 pA \u03bcmol L(-1) for ascorbate), better separation efficiencies (3400 vs. 700 plates m(-1) for iodide and 10000 vs. 2400 plates m(-1) for ascorbate), enhanced peak resolutions (1.6 vs. 1.0) and lower limits of detection (1.5 vs. 5.3 \u03bcM for iodide and 3.1 vs. 7.3 \u03bcM for ascorbate) in comparison with the unmodified Pt electrode. The proposed amperometric sensor was successfully applied for the analysis of ascorbic acid (through its anionic form) in a commercial medicine sample, and the results achieved were in agreement with the value provided by the supplier. Based on the data here presented, the modified graphene electrode shows great promise for ME applications. This article is protected by copyright.
