In addition, blocking of the protein responsible for the synthesis of glutathione (\u03b3-glutamylcysteine synthase-GCL) using 10 mM buthionine sulfoximine was investigated. Each E. coli showed significant differences in resistance to antibiotics. According to the determined resistance, E. coli were divided into experimental groups based on a statistical evaluation of their properties as more resistant and more sensitive. These groups were also used for finding the differences in a dependence of the glutathione pathway on resistance to antibiotics. More sensitive E. coli showed the same kinetics of glutathione synthesis while blocking GCL (Km 0.1 \u00b5M), as compared to non-blocking. In addition, the most frequent mutations in genes of glutathione synthetase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase were observed in this group compared to laboratory E.coli. The group of \"more resistant\" E. coli exhibited differences in Km between 0.3 and 0.8 \u00b5M. The number of mutations compared to the laboratory E. coli was substantially lower compared to the other group.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e6e","authors":["Kominkova, Marketa","Michalek, Petr","Cihalova, Kristyna","Guran, Roman","Cernei, Natalia","Nejdl, Lukas","Smerkova, Kristyna","Dostalova, Simona","Chudobova, Dagmar","Heger, Zbynek","Vesely, Radek","Gumulec, Jaromir","Kynicky, Jindrich","Xhaxhiu, Kledi","Zitka, Ondrej","Adam, Vojtech","Kizek, Rene"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijms16047210","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T21:43:51+00:00","issns":["1422-0067"],"issue":"4","journal":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1428142385,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25837469?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25837469","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Study of Linkage between Glutathione Pathway and the Antibiotic Resistance of Escherichia coli from Patients' Swabs.","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/study-linkage-between-glutathione-pathway-antibiotic-resistance-escherichia-coli-patients-swabs"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4955312,"mean":5.8725269457375,"rank":4143738,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4955312,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167497,"mean":8.9614183502891,"rank":138609,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167497,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2524,"mean":1.8649139912802,"rank":1770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2524,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175,"mean":1.7066206896552,"rank":133,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
