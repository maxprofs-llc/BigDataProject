In the absence of this epidemiologic link, isolated cases are difficult to diagnose. We encountered a patient who developed P. aeruginosa folliculitis subsequent to the use of a loofah sponge grossly contaminated with the same P. aeruginosa strain (serotype 10; pyocin type 1\/a 4,b) that was recovered from her skin lesions. Furthermore, we demonstrated that sterile unused loofah sponges can serve as the sole growth-promoting substrate for P. aeruginosa. To obviate the potential public health problem of contaminated loofah sponges, it is strongly recommended that manufacturers append, and consumers adhere to, instructions as to the care of loofah sponges, which includes allowing the sponge to dry after use.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be9","authors":["E J Bottone","A A Perez, 2nd","A A Perez"],"first_seen_on":"2015-05-21T16:45:29+00:00","issns":["0095-1137","1098-660X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Clinical Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1485463375,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC262805\/pdf\/jcm00015-0020.pdf","http:\/\/jcm.asm.org\/content\/31\/3\/480.short"],"pdf_url":"\/pmc\/articles\/PMC262805\/pdf\/jcm00015-0020.pdf","pmcid":"PMC262805","pmid":"8458939","pubdate":"1993-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society for Microbiology (ASM)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"480","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa folliculitis acquired through use of a contaminated loofah sponge: an unrecognized potential public health problem.","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pseudomonas-aeruginosa-folliculitis-acquired-through-contaminated-loofah-sponge-unrecognized-potenti"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":1.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082038,"mean":6.8946982576228,"rank":3138198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4910191,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082038,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":218764,"mean":8.6377066322917,"rank":73590,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":143771,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":218764,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4398,"mean":4.4968301114396,"rank":2316,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2077,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4398,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86,"mean":5.4964941176471,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
