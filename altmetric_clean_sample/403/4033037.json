Eligible articles were identified by searches of PUBMED, Cochrane Library and Korean Medical Database using the terms (early colorectal carcinoma [ECC], lymph node metastasis [LNM], colectomy, endoscopic resection). Thirteen cohort studies of 7,066 ECC patients who only underwent radical surgery have been analysed. There was a significant risk of LNM when they had submucosal invasion (\u2265 SM2 or \u2265 1,000 \u00b5m) (odds Ratio [OR], 3.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.36-6.62, P = 0.007). Moreover, it has been found that vascular invasion (OR, 2.70; 95% CI, 1.95-3.74; P < 0.001), lymphatic invasion (OR, 6.91; 95% CI, 5.40-8.85; P < 0.001), poorly differentiated carcinomas (OR, 8.27; 95% CI, 4.67-14.66; P < 0.001) and tumor budding (OR, 4.59; 95% CI, 3.44-6.13; P < 0.001) were significantly associated with LNM. Furthermore, another analysis was carried out on eight cohort studies of 310 patients who underwent additional surgeries after an endoscopic resection. The major factors identified in these studies include lymphovascular invasion on polypectomy specimens (OR, 5.47; 95% CI, 2.46-12.17; P < 0.001) and poorly or moderately differentiated carcinomas (OR, 4.07; 95% CI, 1.08-15.33; P = 0.04). For ECC patients with \u2265 SM2 or \u2265 1,000 \u00b5m submucosal invasion, vascular invasion, lymphatic invasion, poorly differentiated carcinomas or tumor budding, it is deemed that a more extensive resection accompanied by a lymph node dissection is necessary. Even if the lesion is completely removed by an endoscopic resection, an additional surgical resection should be considered in patients with poorly or moderately differentiated carcinomas or lymphovascular invasion.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007d0e","authors":["Choi, Ju Young","Jung, Sung-Ae","Shim, Ki-Nam","Cho, Won Young","Keum, Bora","Byeon, Jeong-Sik","Huh, Kyu Chan","Jang, Byung Ik","Chang, Dong Kyung","Jung, Hwoon-Yong","Kong, Kyoung Ae",", "],"doi":"10.3346\/jkms.2015.30.4.398","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T22:18:02+00:00","issns":["1598-6357"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Korean Medical Science","last_mentioned_on":1427969888,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25829807?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25829807","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Meta-analysis of Predictive Clinicopathologic Factors for Lymph Node Metastasis in Patients with Early Colorectal Carcinoma.","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metaanalysis-predictive-clinicopathologic-factors-lymph-node-metastasis-patients-early-colorectal-ca-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4950973,"mean":5.8694094464705,"rank":4140216,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4950973,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167360,"mean":8.9620375480257,"rank":138498,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167360,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":499,"mean":1.8145702811245,"rank":340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":499,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.84166666666667,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Unspecified":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/status\/583574126666743808","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4033037],"posted_on":"2015-04-02T10:18:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":441},"tweet_id":"583574126666743808"}]}}
