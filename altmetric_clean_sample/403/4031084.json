We measured intubating conditions and the onset time according to the types of intravenous anesthetic administered. Measurements of heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were taken immediately prior to induction; immediately and 1 min after IV anesthetic administration; and immediately and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 15 min after endotracheal intubation.\nIntubating conditions were superior in group E compared with group P (P = 0.009). The average onset time of cisatracurium was more rapid in group E (155.74 \u00b1 32.92 s vs. 185.26 \u00b1 38.57 s in group P; P = 0.008). There were no group differences in SBP, DBP, and HR following intravenous anesthetic drug injection and endotracheal intubation. However, SBP and DBP were substantially higher in group E after endotracheal intubation.\nEtomidate improves intubating conditions and provide a more rapid onset time of cisatracurium during anesthetic induction compared to propofol.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8203cf058f61000bc5b","authors":["Ko, Young-Kwon","Kim, Yoon-Hee","Park, Sang-Il","Chung, Woo Suk","Noh, Chan","Lee, Jung-Un"],"doi":"10.4097\/kjae.2015.68.2.136","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T21:11:35+00:00","issns":["2005-6419"],"issue":"2","journal":"Korean Journal of Anesthesiology","last_mentioned_on":1428409255,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25844131?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25844131","pubdate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Comparison of etomidate and propofol on intubating conditions and the onset time associated with cisatracurium administration.","type":"article","volume":"68","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-etomidate-propofol-intubating-conditions-onset-time-associated-cisatracurium-administrati"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4968581,"mean":5.8840996626831,"rank":2613230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":2332732,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4968581,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167799,"mean":8.9660316213544,"rank":95272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":71507,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167799,"percentile":42},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":342,"mean":0.71834604105572,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":275,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":342,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.88571428571429,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
