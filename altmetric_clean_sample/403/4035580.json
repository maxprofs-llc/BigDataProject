Faculty provided immediate feedback on operative errors and residents participated in a final product analysis of their repairs. Residents then received didactic and hands-on training regarding several advanced laparoscopic procedures during a lecture session and animate lab. On day 2, residents performed a nonequivalent LVH repair using a simulator. Three investigators reviewed and coded videos of the repairs using previously developed human error classification systems.\nResidents committed 121 total errors on day 1 compared with 146 on day 2. One of 7 residents successfully completed the LVH repair on day 1 compared with all 7 residents on day 2 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.001). The majority of errors (85%) committed on day 2 were technical and occurred during the last 2 steps of the procedure. There were significant differences in error type (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a0.001) and level (P\u00a0=\u00a0.019) from day 1 to day 2. The proportion of omission errors decreased from day 1 (33%) to day 2 (14%). In addition, there were more technical and commission errors on day\u00a02.\nThe error assessment tool was successful in categorizing performance errors, supporting known-groups validity evidence. Evaluating resident performance through error classification has great potential in facilitating our understanding of operative readiness.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008a97","authors":["D'Angelo, Anne-Lise D","Law, Katherine E","Cohen, Elaine R","Greenberg, Jacob A","Kwan, Calvin","Greenberg, Caprice","Wiegmann, Douglas A","Pugh, Carla M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.surg.2015.04.010","first_seen_on":"2015-05-21T01:42:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0039-6060","1532-7361"],"journal":"Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1432549358,"links":["http:\/\/www.surgjournal.com\/article\/S0039-6060(15)00253-6\/abstract?rss=yes","http:\/\/www.surgjournal.com\/article\/S0039-6060(15)00253-6\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26003910?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.surgjournal.com\/article\/S0039606015002536\/pdf","pmid":"26003910","pubdate":"2015-05-25T10:23:31+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"The use of error analysis to assess resident performance.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/error-analysis-assess-resident-performance"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5141487,"mean":6.0806919019129,"rank":3395356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1530933,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5141487,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171876,"mean":8.9976908567273,"rank":114876,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":48890,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171876,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1662,"mean":2.6741505117399,"rank":887,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":654,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1662,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143,"mean":3.6282394366197,"rank":103,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
