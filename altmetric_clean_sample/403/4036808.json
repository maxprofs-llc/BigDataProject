The repeated cross-sectional GEDA surveys aim to provide current data on health and disease, health determinants and time trends in health and morbidity in the adult population in Germany. This forms the basis for planning requirements and recommendations for public health policy. Between 2008 and 2013, three GEDA waves were carried out, involving a total of 62\u2009606 computer-assisted telephone interviews with adults in Germany, living in private household, and reachable via landline. A core set of indicators was used in all GEDA waves to gather information on subjective health and health-related quality of life, chronic diseases, injuries, impairment to health and disabilities, mental health, health behaviours, social determinants, use of health services and socio-demographic characteristics. The data from the GEDA surveys are provided for public use and epidemiological research.
