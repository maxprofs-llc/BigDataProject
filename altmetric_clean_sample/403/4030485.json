The Conference on Cryptococcus and Cryptococcosis (ICCC) is held every three years: the accompanying Special Issue stems from the 9th ICCC and covers a subset of the topics related to these fungi in detail. This conference started with a revised and reduced estimate of disease burden globally, in part due to improved treatment for HIV(+) people. However, mortality from cryptococcosis remains consistently high for those unfortunate to have limited access to therapies or without underlying immunodefiencies. As such, there are yet still great distances to be covered to address antifungal drug availability, the need for new antifungal agents and the timing and doses of these agents in conjunction with antiviral therapy, underscoring the importance of continued research. A notable point from the 9th ICCC was the research addressing the variation in the pathogen and host populations. Analysis of cryptococcal strain variability, particularly at the molecular level, has resolved distinct lineages with the consequence of a taxonomic revision that divides C. neoformans and C. gattii into seven Cryptococcus species. Similarly, analysis of host factors in so called \"immune-competent\" individuals revealed previously unrecognized risk factors. Research on these species has established them as important model organisms to understand gene evolution and function in other fungi and eukaryotes. The stage is set for the refinement of research directions, leading ultimately to better treatment of this pathogenic monophyletic clade in the genus Cryptococcus.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002922","authors":["Idnurm, Alexander","Lin, Xiaorong","Alexander Idnurm","Xiaorong Lin"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.fgb.2015.05.002","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T20:42:42+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid"],"issns":["1096-0937","10871845"],"journal":"Fungal Genetics & Biology","last_mentioned_on":1439758947,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25983191?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25983191","pubdate":"2015-05-20T22:08:29+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["microbiology","genetics"],"title":"Rising to the challenge of multiple Cryptococcus species and the diseases they cause.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1087184515000985","volume":"78","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rising-challenge-multiple-cryptococcus-species-diseases-cause"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7435645,"mean":6.4638509568192,"rank":2842451,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4568737,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7435645,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":213979,"mean":8.4350036265411,"rank":73810,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":139343,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":213979,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":477,"mean":2.971731092437,"rank":171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":477,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":2.6037142857143,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
