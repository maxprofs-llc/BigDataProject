However, the standard ESD procedure is long, complex, and associated with high complication rates. To overcome these limitations, we devised a double endoscopic intraluminal operation (DEILO) and assessed its efficacy and safety for superficial gastric neoplasms in a preliminary prospective study.\nThe DEILO procedure was performed on 101 patients with gastric cancers. Two endoscopes were simultaneously inserted into the stomach. One endoscope was used to lift the lesion, and the other was used to excise the lesion.\nThe DEILO technique was performed successfully, and en bloc resection was achieved for 98 (97.0\u00a0%) of 101 patients. Histologically curative resection was achieved for 85 lesions (84.2\u00a0%). The mean operating time was 70\u00a0min (range 20-178\u00a0min). Perforation occurred in four patients (4.0\u00a0%), all of whom were successfully treated nonsurgically. Three patients developed postoperative hemorrhage, which was controlled endoscopically.\nThe DEILO procedure appears to shorten the operating time for ESD, with efficacy and complication rates comparable with the standard procedure.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100035f7","authors":["Toyomasu, Yoshitaka","Suzuki, Masaki","Yanoma, Toru","Kimura, Akiharu","Kogure, Norimichi","Ogata, Kyoichi","Ohno, Tetsuro","Mochiki, Erito","Kuwano, Hiroyuki"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00464-015-4179-9","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T22:16:07+00:00","issns":["1432-2218"],"journal":"Surgical Endoscopy","last_mentioned_on":1427970577,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25829066?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25829066","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Abdominal Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Gynecology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Hepatology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Proctology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgery","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","diagnosticimaging","gastroenterology"],"title":"Outcomes of patients with early gastric cancer who underwent double endoscopic intraluminal surgery.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/outcomes-patients-early-gastric-cancer-underwent-double-endoscopic-intraluminal-surgery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4950903,"mean":5.8693368848768,"rank":4140236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4950903,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167357,"mean":8.9624593680538,"rank":138482,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167357,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2396,"mean":1.6994855949896,"rank":1682,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2396,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98,"mean":1.4061855670103,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
