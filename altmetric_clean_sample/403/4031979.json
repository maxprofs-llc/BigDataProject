Since the associated genes are various and quite large, we utilized whole-exome sequencing (WES) as a diagnostic tool to identify the molecular basis of Usher syndrome. DNA from a 12-year-old male diagnosed with Usher Syndrome was analyzed by WES. Mutations detected were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The pathogenicity of these mutations was determined by in silico analysis. A maternally inherited deleterious frameshift mutation, c.14439_14454del in exon 66 and a paternally inherited non-sense c.10830G>A stop-gain SNV in exon 55 of USH2A as two novel compound heterozygous mutations. Both of these mutations disrupt the C terminal of USH2A protein. As a result, WES revealed two novel compound heterozygous mutations in a Turkish USH2A patient. This approach gave us an opportunity to have an appropriate diagnosis and provide genetic counseling to the family within a reasonable time.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002932","authors":["Koparir, Asuman","Karatas, Omer Faruk","Atayoglu, Timucin","Yuksel, Bayram","Sagiroglu, Mahmut Samil","Seven, Mehmet","Ulucan, Hakan","Yuksel, Adnan","Ozen, Mustafa","Asuman Koparir","Omer Faruk Karatas","Ali Timucin Atayoglu","Bayram Yuksel","Mahmut Samil Sagiroglu","Mehmet Seven","Hakan Ulucan","Adnan Yuksel","Mustafa Ozen"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.gene.2015.03.060","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T21:43:03+00:00","issns":["1879-0038","03781119"],"journal":"Gene","last_mentioned_on":1501292960,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25834954?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0378111915003662"],"pmid":"25834954","pubdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Whole-exome Sequencing Revealed Two Novel Mutations in Usher Syndrome.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/wholeexome-sequencing-revealed-two-novel-mutations-usher-syndrome-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8290197,"mean":6.9872012989734,"rank":3487688,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4749873,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8290197,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":219628,"mean":8.694062241892,"rank":83241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":133780,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":219628,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4251,"mean":2.4565096470588,"rank":2339,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":1882,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4251,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":1.6866666666667,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
