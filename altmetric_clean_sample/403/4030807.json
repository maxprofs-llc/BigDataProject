Before surgery, physical examinations such as the gastrointestinal transit test, barium enema, and defecography were performed for all the patients. After surgical treatment, 2-year follow-up was performed using questionnaires to assess the effect of treatment.\nAll 16 cases were treated successfully, with a mean operation time of 230 minutes (range, 180-290 minutes). No intraoperative or postoperative complications were found, and no deaths occurred. Constipation and relevant symptoms were relieved, and all patients were satisfied with their quality of life. The gastrointestinal quality-of-life score was significantly increased 6 months postoperatively (mean, 102) compared with preoperatively (mean, 75).\nSubtotal colectomy combined with the modified Duhamel procedure under laparoscopy is effective and safe for the treatment of mixed constipation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007eed","authors":["Zhu, Xinyong","Li, Jiye","Fu, Tinghuan","Sun, Pengjun","Jing, Yuanyuan","Tian, Wen"],"doi":"10.4293\/jsls.2014.00131","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T20:54:19+00:00","issns":["1938-3797"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons (JSLS)","last_mentioned_on":1428503951,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25848181?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25848181","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Laparoscopic-assisted subtotal colectomy combined with modified duhamel procedure for mixed constipation.","type":"article","volume":"19"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4973997,"mean":5.8881186699807,"rank":4159222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4973997,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167928,"mean":8.9633648906967,"rank":138971,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167928,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":203,"mean":1.6380693069307,"rank":133,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":203,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.275,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/status\/585814146295271426","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4030807],"posted_on":"2015-04-08T14:39:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":439},"tweet_id":"585814146295271426"}]}}
