Ophthalmic symptoms included ptosis in 41 (23%), diplopia in 36 (20.5%), decreased vision in 24 (14%), and dry eye complaints in 12 (7%). Ophthalmic signs included ptosis in 45 (26%), abnormal ocular motility in 15 (8.5%), strabismus in 14 (8%), pupillary dysfunction in 12 (7%), and findings consistent with dry eyes in 4 (2%).\nA significant number of patients reported ophthalmic symptoms, and many had objective findings on clinical examination consistent with these symptoms. To our knowledge, this is the largest case series of ophthalmic findings in patients with LEMS and indicates that these patients warrant a complete ophthalmic examination.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d90","authors":["Young, Jeffery D","Leavitt, Jacqueline A","Young, Jeffery D.","Leavitt, Jacqueline A."],"doi":"10.1097\/wno.0000000000000258","first_seen_on":"2015-05-21T07:47:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1070-8022","1536-5166"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Neuro-Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1455892937,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jneuro-ophthalmology\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Lambert_Eaton_Myasthenic_Syndrome___Ocular_Signs.99586.aspx","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25993122?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jneuro-ophthalmology\/Abstract\/2016\/03000\/Lambert_Eaton_Myasthenic_Syndrome___Ocular_Signs.5.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jneuro-ophthalmology\/9000\/00000\/Lambert_Eaton_Myasthenic_Syndrome___Ocular_Signs.99586.pdf","pmid":"25993122","pubdate":"2015-05-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurology","ophthalmology"],"title":"Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome: Ocular Signs and Symptoms.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jneuro-ophthalmology\/Fulltext\/2016\/03000\/Lambert_Eaton_Myasthenic_Syndrome___Ocular_Signs.5.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lamberteaton-myasthenic-syndrome-ocular-signs-symptoms-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7214390,"mean":6.3538386288811,"rank":5174952,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1783903,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7214390,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":213219,"mean":8.3738449568049,"rank":136976,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":63433,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":213219,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":491,"mean":1.6579755102041,"rank":194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":216,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":491,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":2.6096153846154,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/journalneurooph\/status\/601293128314724353","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4036126],"posted_on":"2015-05-21T07:47:07+00:00","author":{"name":"journalneuroph","url":"http:\/\/www.jneuro-ophthalmology.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1464463730\/neurooph_normal.jpg","description":"Journal of Neuro-Ophthalmology keeps pace with important advances in all spheres of the neurologic and ophthalmologic sciences.","id_on_source":"journalneurooph","tweeter_id":"339067704","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":54},"tweet_id":"601293128314724353"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/eyecenterllc\/statuses\/700691881991270400","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4036126],"posted_on":"2016-02-19T14:42:17+00:00","author":{"name":"Eye Center","url":"http:\/\/eyecenterllc.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/355341300\/apple-touch-icon_normal.png","description":"Ophthalmologists - Eye Physicians and Surgeons.
