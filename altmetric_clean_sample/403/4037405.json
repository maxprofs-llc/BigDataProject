CP subtypes were classified as spastic unilateral (n=35), spastic bilateral (n=49), dyskinetic (n=5), and other (n=10), in accordance with the criteria of the Surveillance of Cerebral Palsy in Europe. Habitual dietary intake of food textures, energy, and water were determined from parent-completed 3-day weighed food records. Parent-reported feeding ability of food textures was reported on the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory and a feeding questionnaire. OPD was classified based on clinical feeding assessment using the Dysphagia Disorders Survey (rated by a certified assessor, KAB) and a subjective Swallowing Safety Recommendation (classified by a paediatric speech pathologist, KAB).\nFood\/fluid textures were modified for 39% of children. Children with poorer gross motor function tended to receive a greater proportion of energy from fluids (GMFCS levels IV-V: \u03b2=0.9, p=0.002) in their diets and fewer chewable foods (level III: \u03b2=-0.7, p=0.03; levels IV-V: \u03b2=-1.8, p<0.001) compared to level I to II participants. Fluids represented a texture for which children frequently had OPD and the texture most frequently identified as unsafe (or recommended for instrumental assessment).\nThese findings indicate that swallowing safety, feeding efficiency, and energy\/water intake should be considered when providing feeding recommendations for children with CP.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026f3","authors":["Benfer, Katherine A","Weir, Kelly A","Bell, Kristie L","Ware, Robert S","Davies, Peter SW","Boyd, Roslyn N","Davies, Peter S W","Katherine A Benfer","Kelly A Weir","Kristie L Bell","Robert S Ware","Peter S W Davies","Roslyn N Boyd"],"doi":"10.1111\/dmcn.12796","endpage":"1063","first_seen_on":"2015-05-21T16:43:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1469-8749","00121622"],"issue":"11","journal":"Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1432226536,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/dmcn.12796\/abstract;jsessionid=DE8D042307ACA30BD97A8445C0DDDEB8.f02t02"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/dmcn.12796\/pdf","pmid":"25982341","pubdate":"2015-05-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"1056","subjects":["neurology","pediatrics"],"title":"Food and fluid texture consumption in a population\u2010based cohort of preschool children with cerebral palsy: relationship to dietary intake","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/dmcn.12796","volume":"57","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/food-fluid-texture-consumption-populationbased-cohort-preschool-children-cerebral-palsy-relationship"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6371069,"mean":5.9846015719813,"rank":4710542,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":944848,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6371069,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175464,"mean":9.0782014897728,"rank":123570,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":32664,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175464,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1133,"mean":3.0578957597173,"rank":813,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":162,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1133,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":2.1960714285714,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
