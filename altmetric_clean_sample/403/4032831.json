Data collection and analysis were informed by the constant comparative approach and facilitated through charting.\nFindings were similar in people from different ethnic backgrounds. Exploration of levels of recall of the sessions suggested that this was variable and sometimes very limited, but that interviewees had all assimilated some relevant learning. Key themes emerged relating to the way in which interviewees recalled and had been influenced by positive (good news) and negative (bad news) messages within the education sessions, including biomedical explanations. Both types of message appeared to have an important role in terms of motivation to change behaviour, but a notable observation was that none of the interviewees recalled receiving bad news messages when diagnosed.\nOur findings have highlighted the importance of providing and combining both negative and positive messages within education designed to promote self-management behaviour change.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100057eb","authors":["Eborall, Helen C","Virdee, Satnam K","Patel, Naina","Redwood, Sabi","Greenfield, Sheila M","Stone, Margaret A"],"doi":"10.1177\/1742395315577965","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T22:10:10+00:00","funders":["dohuk"],"issns":["1745-9206"],"journal":"Chronic Illness","last_mentioned_on":1427978379,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25827572"],"pmid":"25827572","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"\"And now for the good news\u2026\" the impact of negative and positive messages in self-management education for people with Type 2 diabetes: A qualitative study in an ethnically diverse population.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/now-good-news-impact-negative-positive-messages-selfmanagement-education-people-type-2-diabetes-qual"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5033220,"mean":5.9655498050018,"rank":3544426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":840255,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5033220,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169810,"mean":8.9825663539624,"rank":123364,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":29207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169810,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98,"mean":3.6663505154639,"rank":76,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DIAMONDS_YH\/status\/583609739709386752","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4032831],"posted_on":"2015-04-02T12:39:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Research","url":"http:\/\/www.diamonds.nihr.ac.uk","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/906440542866825216\/dhgokqhz_normal.jpg","description":"DIAMONDS Research: Diabetes and Mental Illness - Improving Outcomes and Services","id_on_source":"DIAMONDS_YH","tweeter_id":"2980077999","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":120},"tweet_id":"583609739709386752"}]}}
