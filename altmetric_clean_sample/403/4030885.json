Although clinical evaluation now is under way, PET\/MR demands for new technologies and innovative solutions, currently subject to interdisciplinary research. Attenuation correction (AC) of human soft tissues and of hardware components has to be MR based to maintain quantification of PET imaging as CT attenuation information is missing. MR-based AC is inherently associated with the following challenges: patient tissues are segmented into only few tissue classes, providing discrete attenuation coefficients; bone is substituted as soft tissue in MR-based AC; the limited field of view in MRI leads to truncations in body imaging and, consequently, in MR-based AC; and correct segmentation of lung tissue may be hampered by breathing artifacts. Use of time of flight during PET image acquisition and reconstruction, however, may improve the accuracy of AC. This article provides a status of current image acquisition options in PET\/MR hybrid imaging.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f6100088fb","authors":["Boellaard, Ronald","Quick, Harald H"],"doi":"10.1053\/j.semnuclmed.2014.12.001","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T21:00:07+00:00","issns":["1558-4623"],"issue":"3","journal":"Seminars in Nuclear Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1428440104,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25841274?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25841274","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"Current Image Acquisition Options in PET\/MR.","type":"article","volume":"45","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/current-image-acquisition-options-petmr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4968581,"mean":5.8840996626831,"rank":4154765,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4968581,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167799,"mean":8.9660405606743,"rank":138870,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167799,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":217,"mean":1.1943981481481,"rank":140,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":217,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.95,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
