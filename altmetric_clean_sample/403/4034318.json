The hypothesized logic of disposal site choice of serial killers led to predictions that (a) their criminal domains would be around their home base and relate to familiar travel distances, (b) they would have a size that was characteristic of each offender, (c) the distribution would be biased towards other non-criminal activities, and (d) the size of the domains would increase over time. Examination of the geographical distribution of the sites at which 126 US and 29 UK serial killers disposed of their victims' bodies supported all four hypotheses. It was found that rational choice and routine activity models of criminal behavior could explain the spatial choices of serial murderers. It was concluded that the locations at which serial killers dispose of their victims' bodies reflect the inherent logic of the choices that underlie their predatory activities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023a9","authors":["Lundrigan, S","Canter, D"],"first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T22:54:09+00:00","issns":["0735-3936"],"issue":"4","journal":"Behavioral Sciences & the Law","last_mentioned_on":1445425427,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11568963","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/11568963\/"],"pmid":"11568963","pubdate":"2001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Law","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences","jurisprudence"],"title":"Spatial patterns of serial murder: an analysis of disposal site location choice.","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/research-report-spatial-patterns-serial-murder-analysis-disposal-site-location-choice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8084848,"mean":6.8778046874522,"rank":3798846,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4106091,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8084848,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":218409,"mean":8.6486366799751,"rank":99640,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":111048,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":218409,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":426,"mean":6.8434917647059,"rank":282,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":133,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":426,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":29.468923076923,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":3}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CAHIDuod\/status\/582819064411787264","license":"datasift","rt":["drjezphillips"],"citation_ids":[4034318],"posted_on":"2015-03-31T08:17:47+00:00","author":{"name":"CAHID","url":"http:\/\/cahid.dundee.ac.uk","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/816688143835467776\/xr7LXQsb_normal.jpg","description":"The Centre for Anatomy and Human Identification (CAHID) at the University of Dundee @dundeeuni","id_on_source":"CAHIDuod","tweeter_id":"22470826","geo":{"lt":56.46913,"ln":-2.97489,"country":"GB"},"followers":2741},"tweet_id":"582819064411787264"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/drjezphillips\/status\/582818358321672192","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4034318],"posted_on":"2015-03-31T08:14:59+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr Jez Phillips","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/556050993259884544\/pOaPXpbR_normal.png","description":"Happy family man, applied psychologist.
