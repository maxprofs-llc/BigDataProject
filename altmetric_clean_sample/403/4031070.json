Additional isolates were obtained from processed manure (a mixture of composted manure, straw and hydrated lime) and bedding materials. The processed manure was later used to cover the floor of the stalls in barns as bedding materials. The temperatures recorded in the composted and processed manure were not as high as those generally observed during satisfactory composting. To reveal the association of A. viridans in manure-related products with intramammary infection in cows, isolates were characterized by their DNA fragment patterns as determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Isolates obtained from milk, processed manure and bedding materials had identical DNA fragment patterns. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined for 29 isolates from milk, processed manure and bedding materials. Of these, 26 (89.7%) were resistant to clindamycin, whereas virtually all the isolates were susceptible to 12 other antimicrobials including cefalosporins that have been used to treat bovine mastitis in Japan. In vitro, three A. viridans isolates from milk and an isolate from processed manure survived for 3 hr in Good's buffer (pH 9.0) at high temperature (50\u00b0C). The results suggest that the processed manure and bedding materials in this farm were possible sources of A. viridans that caused infection in the cows with mastitis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f1f","authors":["Saishu, Nobukazu","Morimoto, Kazutaka","Yamasato, Hiroshi","Ozaki, Hiroichi","Murase, Toshiyuki"],"doi":"10.1292\/jvms.15-0100","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T21:10:57+00:00","issns":["1347-7439"],"journal":"Journal of Veterinary Medical Science","last_mentioned_on":1468530125,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25843745?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25843745","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Characterization of Aerococcus viridans isolated from milk samples from cows with mastitis and manure samples.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterization-aerococcus-viridans-isolated-milk-samples-cows-mastitis-manure-samples"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8071125,"mean":6.8533209909723,"rank":5843270,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1941664,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8071125,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":218268,"mean":8.6439773121909,"rank":141130,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":64176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":218268,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1496,"mean":1.0323839464883,"rank":406,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":880,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1496,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":0.92391304347826,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
