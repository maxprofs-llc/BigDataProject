In the present study, we investigated the differential expression and clinical significance of these three miRNAs in glioneuronal tumors (gangliogliomas, GGs) which are characterized by prominent activation of the innate immune response.\nThe expression levels of miR21, miR146, and miR155 were evaluated using Taqman PCR in 34 GGs, including 15 cases with sufficient amount of perilesional cortex. Their expression was correlated with the tumor features and the clinical history of epilepsy. In addition, in situ hybridization was used to evaluate their cellular distribution in both tumor and peritumoral cortex.\nIncreased expression of miR146a was observed in both tumor and peritumoral cortex compared to control samples. miR146a was detected in both neuronal and astroglial cells. Tumor and peritumoral miR146a expression was negatively correlated with frequency of seizures and the density of activated microglial cells. Neuronal and astroglial expression was observed for both miR21 and miR155 with increased expression of miR21 within the tumor and miR155 in the peritumoral region. Negative correlations were observed between the miRNA levels and the expression of putative targets within the astroglial component of the tumor.\nWe report a differential regulation of three miRNAs, known to be related to inflammation, in both tumor and peritumoral cortex of patients with GG. Moreover, our findings suggest a functional relationship between miR146a expression and epilepsy, either directly in epileptogenesis or as modulation of seizure activity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000085d","authors":["Prabowo, A S","van Scheppingen, J","Iyer, A M","Anink, J J","Spliet, W G M","van Rijen, P C","Meeteren, A Y N Schouten-van","Aronica, E"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12974-015-0315-7","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T21:36:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1742-2094"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Neuroinflammation","last_mentioned_on":1432157705,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25986346?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25986346","pubdate":"2015-05-20T22:04:31+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurobiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Differential expression and clinical significance of three inflammation-related microRNAs in gangliogliomas.","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/differential-expression-clinical-significance-three-inflammationrelated-micrornas-gangliogliomas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5124816,"mean":6.0645817669528,"rank":4262415,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5124816,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171255,"mean":9.0221506300584,"rank":141372,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171255,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":785,"mean":3.6462576530612,"rank":673,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":785,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":3.7488085106383,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
