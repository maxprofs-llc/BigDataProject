The molecular mechanisms of \u03b1S aggregation and fibrillogenesis are largely unknown. Several studies suggested a sequence of events from \u03b1S dimerization via oligomerization and pre-fibrillar aggregation to \u03b1S fibril formation. In contrast to \u03b1S, little evidence suggests that \u03b3S can form protein aggregates in the brain, and for \u03b2S its neurotoxic properties and aggregation propensities are controversially discussed. These apparent differences in aggregation behavior prompted us to investigate the first step in Synuclein aggregation, i.e. the formation of dimers or oligomers, by Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation in cells. This assay showed some Synuclein-specific limitations, questioning its performance on a single cell level. Nevertheless, we unequivocally demonstrate that all Synucleins can interact with each other in a very similar way. Given the divergent aggregation properties of the three Synucleins this suggests that formation of dimers is not predictive for the aggregation of \u03b1S, \u03b2S or \u03b3S in the aged or diseased brain.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c38","authors":["Eckermann, Katrin","K\u00fcgler, Sebastian","B\u00e4hr, Mathias"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbadis.2015.05.002","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T23:21:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0006-3002"],"journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA)","last_mentioned_on":1433462400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25960149","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.bbadis.2015.05.002"],"pmid":"25960149","pubdate":"2015-05-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Dimerization propensities of Synucleins are not predictive for Synuclein aggregation.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dimerization-propensities-synucleins-not-predictive-synuclein-aggregation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5187004,"mean":6.1241370799307,"rank":663605,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":4508636,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5187004,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172186,"mean":9.0335553968117,"rank":31831,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":139984,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172186,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4547,"mean":2.7175270567532,"rank":173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":4364,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4547,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":166,"mean":1.8865939393939,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":153,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":166,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
