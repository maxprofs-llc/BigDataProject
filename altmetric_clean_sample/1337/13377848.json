Hyperactivation in these regions is typically interpreted as a form of neural compensation and related to articulatory processing. Fronto-striatal hyperactivation in RD can however, also arise from fundamental impairment in reading related processes, such as phonological processing and implicit sequence learning relevant to early language acquisition. We review current evidence for the compensation hypothesis in RD and apply large-scale reverse inference to investigate anatomical overlap between hyperactivation regions and neural systems for articulation, phonological processing, implicit sequence learning. We found anatomical convergence between hyperactivation regions and regions supporting articulation, consistent with the proposed compensatory role of these regions, and low convergence with phonological and implicit sequence learning regions. Although the application of large-scale reverse inference to decode function in a clinical population should be interpreted cautiously, our findings suggest future lines of research that may clarify the functional significance of hyperactivation in RD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031ab","authors":["Roeland Hancock","Fabio Richlan","Fumiko Hoeft","Hancock, Roeland","Richlan, Fabio","Hoeft, Fumiko"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neubiorev.2016.10.025","first_seen_on":"2016-11-06T03:06:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["01497634","1873-7528"],"journal":"Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1488044897,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0149763415301172","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0149763415301172?utm_content=buffer12513&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmid":"27826071","pubdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences","neurology"],"title":"Possible roles for fronto-striatal circuits in reading disorder","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/possible-roles-frontostriatal-circuits-reading-disorder"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12.25,"score_history":{"1y":12.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8272014,"mean":6.980828736602,"rank":688836,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7579193,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8272014,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242600,"mean":13.084581544029,"rank":33572,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":208860,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242600,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1699,"mean":10.39903180212,"rank":289,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":1409,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1699,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":7.1968666666667,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":78,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":13,"researcher":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":13,"Scientists":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
