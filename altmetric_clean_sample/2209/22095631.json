Fall-related injuries are the leading cause of death and disability and cost the United States approximately $31 billion annually. Currently, no repository of scene data exists that informs prevention programs regarding circumstances that contribute to older adult falls. This was a multicenter (4 sites: Kansas, Maryland, Oregon, and Texas) pilot study consisting of interviews of older (55+ years) patients who had been admitted to a trauma center with fall-related injuries. Questions included information regarding environment, behaviors, injuries, and demographics. Additional information was abstracted from patient medical record: comorbidities, medications, and discharge information. Data are presented descriptively. Forty-nine patients were interviewed: average age was 78 years; White (93.9%); female (53.1%); and most (63.3%) had fallen before. The most commonly reported fall factors and injuries included those occurring at home without agency services (65.0%), on hard flooring (51.1%), with laced shoes (44.2%), and with walkers (36.7%) and contained contusion\/open wound of head (61.2%). Survey time was anecdotally estimated at 10-15 min. Preliminary data suggest that prevention efforts should emphasize on educating older adults to focus on ambulation, body position, and use of assistive devices in their daily activities. The development of a systematic and organized registry that documents scene data would inform public health agencies to develop fall prevention programs that promote older adult safety. Furthermore, it would provide a large sample size to test factor associations with injury severity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005ad2","authors":["Berg, Gina M.","Carlson, Tara","Fairchild, Joanne","Edwards, Courtney","Sorell, Ryan"],"doi":"10.1097\/jtn.0000000000000295","first_seen_on":"2017-07-18T11:03:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1078-7496"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Trauma Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1501625108,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/journaloftraumanursing\/Abstract\/2017\/07000\/Development_of_a_Falls_Registry___A_Pilot_Study.3.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/journaloftraumanursing\/2017\/07000\/Development_of_a_Falls_Registry___A_Pilot_Study.3.pdf","pmid":"28692616","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"224","subjects":["nursing"],"title":"Development of a Falls Registry","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/journaloftraumanursing\/Fulltext\/2017\/07000\/Development_of_a_Falls_Registry___A_Pilot_Study.3.aspx","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-falls-registry"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":1.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8307946,"mean":7.0029014072595,"rank":3933181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4190233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8307946,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":198314,"mean":12.035903354798,"rank":90677,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":101510,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":198314,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":470,"mean":1.7408486140725,"rank":116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":470,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":2.5,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/injurywatch\/statuses\/887262673947295745","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22095631],"posted_on":"2017-07-18T10:48:00+00:00","author":{"name":"InjuryWatch","url":"http:\/\/WWW.facebook.com\/injurywatch","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/604985245750951936\/C1CZi2md_normal.png","description":"Tracking Health Information Technology and Injury information for better injury data, surveillance and outcomes.","id_on_source":"injurywatch","tweeter_id":"1658850073","geo":{"lt":42.35843,"ln":-71.05977,"country":"US"},"followers":421},"tweet_id":"887262673947295745"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Traumacenters\/statuses\/892506511032950789","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22095631],"posted_on":"2017-08-01T22:05:08+00:00","author":{"name":"TCAA","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/718138777521270784\/aJuB2tfk_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"Traumacenters","tweeter_id":"3553671733","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":89},"tweet_id":"892506511032950789"}]}}
