Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression levels of miR-135a and IGF-1, PI3K, Akt, VEGF, bFGF and IL-8 mRNA; western blotting was used to determine the expression levels of IGF-1, PI3K and Akt protein; and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to analyze the expression levels of VEGF, bFGF and IL-8 protein. Human NSCLC cell lines (A549, H460, and H1299) and the human bronchial epithelial cell line (HBE) were selected. A549 cells were assigned to blank, negative control (NC), miR-135a mimics, miR-135a inhibitors, IGF-1 siRNA and miR-135a inhibitors + IGF-1 siRNA groups. The following were performed: an MTT assay to assess cell proliferation, a scratch test to detect cell migration, a Transwell assay to measure cell invasion, and a flow cytometry to analyze cell apoptosis.\nThe expression level of miR-135a was lower while those of IGF-1, PI3K and Akt mRNA were higher in NSCLC tissues than in the adjacent normal tissues. Dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated IGF-1 as a target of miR-135a. The in vitro results showed that compared with the blank group, cell proliferation, migration and invasion were suppressed, mRNA and protein levels of IGF-1, PI3K, Akt, VEGF, bFGF and IL-8 were reduced, and cell apoptosis was enhanced in the miR-135a mimics and IGF-1 siRNA groups. Compared with the IGF-1 siRNA group, cells in the miR-135a inhibitors + IGF-1 siRNA group demonstrated increased cell proliferation, migration and invasion, elevated mRNA and protein levels of IGF-1, PI3K, Akt, VEGF, bFGF and IL-8 and reduced cell apoptosis.\nThese findings indicated that miR-135a promotes cell apoptosis and inhibits cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor angiogenesis by targeting IGF-1 gene through the IGF-1\/PI3K\/Akt signaling pathway in NSCLC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024cd","authors":["Zhou, Yufei","Li, Shaoxia","Li, Jiangtao","Wang, Dongfeng","Li, Quanxing","Yufei Zhou","Shaoxia Li","Jiangtao Li","Dongfeng Wang","Quanxing Li"],"doi":"10.1159\/000479207","first_seen_on":"2017-07-18T10:12:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1015-8987","1421-9778"],"issue":"4","journal":"Cellular Physiology & Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1500940564,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28715819?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28715819","https:\/\/www.karger.com\/Article\/FullText\/479207"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.karger.com\/Article\/Pdf\/479207","pmid":"28715819","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"S.
