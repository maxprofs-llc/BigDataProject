REST\/NRSF represses transcription of these genes in stem cells and non-neuronal cells by tethering corepressor complexes. Aberrant REST\/NRSF expression and intracellular localization are associated with cancer and neurodegeneration in humans. To date, detailed molecular analyses of REST\/NRSF and its C-terminal repressor complex have been hampered largely by the lack of sufficient amounts of purified REST\/NRSF and its complexes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to express and purify human REST\/NRSF and its C-terminal interactors in a baculovirus multiprotein expression system as individual proteins and coexpressed complexes. All proteins were enriched in the nucleus, and REST\/NRSF was isolated as a slower migrating form, characteristic of nuclear REST\/NRSF in mammalian cells. Both REST\/NRSF alone and its C-terminal repressor complex were functionally active in histone deacetylation and histone demethylation and bound to RE1\/NRSE sites. Additionally, the mechanisms of inhibition of the small-molecule drugs 4SC-202 and SP2509 were analyzed. These drugs interfered with the viability of medulloblastoma cells, where REST\/NRSF has been implicated in cancer pathogenesis. Thus, a resource for molecular REST\/NRSF studies and drug development has been established. This article is protected by copyright.
