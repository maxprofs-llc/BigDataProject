The use of the approximation had little impact on the estimation of the crossing angle, the axonal density index, and the radius index in clinically realistic scenarios wherein the acquisition noise was the predominant source of errors. In the absence of noise, large systematic errors due to the superposition approximation only persisted for the radius index, mainly driven by a low sensitivity of diffusion-weighted MRI signals to small radii in general.\nThe use of the superposition approximation rather than a model of interwoven fascicles does not adversely impact the estimation of microstructural features of interwoven fascicles in most current clinical settings.
