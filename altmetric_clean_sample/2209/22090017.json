In this work, two novel series of nicotinic acid hydrazone derivatives (6a-r) and quinolone hydrazide derivatives (12a-l) were synthesized and evaluated as antimicrobial and antitubercular agents. The synthesized compounds were evaluated in\u00a0vitro for their antibacterial, antifungal and antimycobacterial activities. Compounds 6f and 6p bearing the 3,4,5- (OCH3)3 and 2,5-(OCH3)2 benzylidene motifs were the most potent and as antibacterial, antifungal (MIC: 0.49-1.95\u00a0\u03bcg\/mL) and (MIC: 0.49-0.98\u00a0\u03bcg\/mL) respectively and antimycobacterial activity (MIC\u00a0=\u00a00.76 and 0.39\u00a0\u03bcg\/mL) respectively. Besides, several derivatives, 6e, 6h, 6l-6o, 6q, 6r, 12a, 12b, 12e, 12h, 12k and 12l, exhibited significant antibacterial and antifungal activities with MIC values ranging from 1.95 to 7.81\u00a0\u03bcg\/mL, they also displayed excellent to good activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis with MIC range from 0.39 to 3.12\u00a0\u03bcg\/mL. In addition, some of the most active compounds were tested for cytotoxic activities against human lung fibroblast normal cells (WI-38) and displayed low toxicity. Moreover, 2D-QSAR models to characterize the descriptors controlling the observed activities, were generated and validated.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000283d","authors":["Abdelrahman, Mohamed A.","Salama, Ismail","Gomaa, Mohamed S.","Elaasser, Mahmoud M.","Abdel-Aziz, Marwa M.","Soliman, Dalia H."],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ejmech.2017.07.004","first_seen_on":"2017-07-18T10:00:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0223-5234","1768-3254"],"journal":"European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1500373943,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28715707?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28715707?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28715707","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Design, synthesis and 2D QSAR study of novel pyridine and quinolone hydrazone derivatives as potential antimicrobial and antitubercular agents","type":"article","volume":"138","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/design-synthesis-2d-qsar-study-novel-pyridine-quinolone-hydrazone-derivatives-potential-antimicrobia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8229472,"mean":6.9710874477773,"rank":6249244,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1107862,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8229472,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163879,"mean":11.676168698666,"rank":116008,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":29879,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163879,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1140,"mean":1.8618595258999,"rank":560,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":398,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1140,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":2.7930769230769,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MycobactPapers\/statuses\/887250606385238016","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22090017],"posted_on":"2017-07-18T10:00:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Mycobacterium Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/719097737984274432\/6xb8SSeZ_normal.jpg","description":"A daily collection of papers relating to Mycobacterium.
