Positive findings of syndromes, laboratory examinations and M. kansasii identified in the puncture fluid indicated the diagnosis of disseminated M. kansasii infections involving skin\/soft tissue, pulmonary and mediastinal lymph nodes. After applying the standard HRE regime (isoniazid (300mg\/d), rifampicin (600mg\/d), and ethambutol (750mg\/d)), the patient's temperature normalized and symptoms relieved gradually. No special adverse drug reactions occurred and skin lesions healed after 4-month follow-up. Disseminated M. kansasii infection mainly occurred in immunocompromised patients. Moreover, disseminated infection with skin lesions was rare in immunocompetent patients. This is the second immunocompetent case after reviewing the only eight similar cases reported with disseminated M. kansasii infection with cutaneous lesions. Special attention should be paid on persistent and chronic rash following chronic respiratory syndromes to exclude nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) skin disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000c89","authors":["Zhang, Miaomiao","Feng, Mei","He, Jian-Qing"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijid.2017.07.006","first_seen_on":"2017-07-18T10:00:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1201-9712","1878-3511"],"journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1500372663,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28712930?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28712930?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28712930","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Disseminated  Mycobacterium kansasii  infection with cutaneous lesions in an immunocompetent patient","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/disseminated-mycobacterium-kansasii-infection-cutaneous-lesions-immunocompetent-patient"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8229472,"mean":6.9710874477773,"rank":6249245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1107863,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8229472,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163877,"mean":11.676294112622,"rank":116009,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":29879,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163877,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1288,"mean":5.099627039627,"rank":911,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":220,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1288,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":2.7709677419355,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MycobactPapers\/statuses\/887250681438105602","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22090036],"posted_on":"2017-07-18T10:00:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Mycobacterium Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/719097737984274432\/6xb8SSeZ_normal.jpg","description":"A daily collection of papers relating to Mycobacterium.
