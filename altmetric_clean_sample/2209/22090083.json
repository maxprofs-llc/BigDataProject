Physiological assessments of sacral and thoracolumbar reflexes have mainly been conducted among women with SCI. When performed, they reveal the existence of a psychogenic and\/or reflex sexual potential in those women. Other forms of physiological assessments include vulvar sensitivity testing in women with SCI, quantitative sensory testing and pudendal somatosensory evoked potentials in MS populations. A few validated self-reporting measures are also available to assess sexual potential and sexual satisfaction, although mostly in women with SCI and MS.\nDespite high prevalence rates and important clinical implications, sexual dysfunction is not systematically assessed in women presenting various neurological conditions. Several well-validated tools exist for such assessments, which could be used for sexual rehabilitation in these patients. The implementation of systematic assessments of sexual potential is feasible and renewed efforts should be made to do so in clinical practice.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002283","authors":["Courtois, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique","G\u00e9rard, Marina","Charvier, Kathleen","Vodu\u0161ek, David B.","Amarenco, G\u00e9rard"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.rehab.2017.04.004","first_seen_on":"2017-07-18T10:01:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1877-0657","1877-0665","18770657"],"journal":"Annals of Physical & Rehabilitation Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1500552882,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28713038?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28713038?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28713038\/?from=multiple+sclerosis&i=53","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28713038\/?i=53&from=multiple+sclerosis"],"pmid":"28713038","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine"],"title":"Assessment of sexual function in women with neurological disorders: A review","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/assessment-sexual-function-women-neurological-disorders-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":2,"3m":2,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8247986,"mean":6.9694821610306,"rank":3567431,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4563069,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8247986,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170205,"mean":11.670451540504,"rank":66894,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":100344,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170205,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237,"mean":2.8891186440678,"rank":70,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":165,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":2.12,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
