It inhibits epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition that is necessary for cell migration, and it is involved in neural tube closure, epithelial morphogenesis, and barrier formation during embryogenesis by regulation of the expression of cell junction proteins such as E-cadherin and vimentin. Cancer shares many common characters with development such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. In addition to its important role in development, grainyhead-like 2 is implicated in carcinogenesis as well. However, the reports on grainyhead-like 2 in various cancers are controversial. Grainyhead-like 2 can act as either a tumor suppressor or an oncogene with the mechanisms not well elucidated. In this review, we summarized recent progress on grainyhead-like 2 in development and cancer in order to get an insight into the regulation network of grainyhead-like 2 and understand the roles of grainyhead-like 2 in various cancers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008c15","authors":["Lijun Ma","Hongli Yan","Hui Zhao","Jianmin Sun"],"doi":"10.1177\/1010428317698375","first_seen_on":"2017-05-02T10:09:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1010-4283","1423-0380"],"issue":"5","journal":"Tumor Biology","last_mentioned_on":1493719455,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28459369?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28459369","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Grainyhead-like 2 in development and cancer","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/grainyheadlike-2-development-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8161363,"mean":6.8964925866473,"rank":7066946,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8161363,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235448,"mean":12.575427021792,"rank":191304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235448,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1974,"mean":1.2589711099848,"rank":1156,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1974,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160,"mean":2.9601383647799,"rank":83,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/fly_papers\/statuses\/859347797644005376","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19777912],"posted_on":"2017-05-02T10:04:15+00:00","author":{"name":"flypapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3298285242\/dc1d0402d707fe3606f9d653cd85fe6d_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot of #Drosophila papers in #PubMed\/#arXiv\/#bioRxiv\/#PeerJ\/#F1000.
