SMC mediated DNA bridging keeps sister chromatids aligned for much of the cell cycle, while the active extrusion of DNA loops by SMC presumably compacts chromosomes. Chromosome superstructure is thus given by the number of DNA linkages and the size of chromosomal DNA loops, which in turn depend on the dynamics of SMC loading and unloading. The latter is regulated by the intrinsic SMC ATPase activity, multiple external factors and post-translational modification. Here, I highlight recent advances in our understanding of DNA capture and release by SMC-with a focus on cohesin.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a0","authors":["Stephan Gruber"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ceb.2017.04.002","first_seen_on":"2017-05-02T10:27:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["09550674","1879-0410"],"journal":"Current Opinion in Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1494247702,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28460277?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0955067416301600&_version=1&md5=ad727883bdd7039a9f2f444d12eb468d"],"pmid":"28460277","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Shaping chromosomes by DNA capture and release: gating the SMC rings","type":"article","volume":"46","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/shaping-chromosomes-dna-capture-release-gating-smc-rings"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.6,"score_history":{"1y":3.6,"6m":3.6,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8241602,"mean":6.9693594098944,"rank":1927925,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6301059,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8241602,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241991,"mean":12.532030935162,"rank":73595,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":167560,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241991,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":661,"mean":2.8329454545455,"rank":92,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":568,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":661,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":4.3058823529412,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
