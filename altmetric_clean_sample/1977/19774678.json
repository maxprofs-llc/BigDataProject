Total microbial colonies were counted and each unique colony morphology was processed to identify the bacterial species and to determine the susceptibility profile to 15 selected antibiotics.\nSpecimens were analyzed from the skin samples of 71 eyes from 36 patients. Prior to treatment, 194 unique bacterial isolates belonging to 33 different species were recovered. Twenty minutes after treatment, 138 unique bacterial isolates belonging to 26 different species were identified. Staphylococci accounted for 61% of all strains recovered and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains comprised 60% of the staphylococcal strains. No substantial differences in the distribution of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, or anaerobic species were noted before and after treatment. The quantitative data demonstrated a >99% reduction in the staphylococcal load on the surface of the skin 20 minutes following application of the hygiene solution. The total S. epidermidis colony-forming units were reduced by 99.5%. The HOCl hygiene solution removed staphylococcal isolates that were resistant to multiple antibiotics equally well as those isolates that were susceptible to antibiotics.\nThe application of a saline hygiene solution preserved with pure HOCl acid reduced the bacterial load significantly without altering the diversity of bacterial species remaining on the skin under the lower eyelid.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f15","authors":["David W Stroman","Keri Mintun","Arthur B Epstein","Crystal M Brimer","Chirag R Patel","James D Branch","Kathryn Najafi-Tagol","David Stroman","Arthur Epstein","Crystal Brimer","Chirag Patel","James Branch"],"doi":"10.2147\/opth.s132851","first_seen_on":"2017-05-02T07:02:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1177-5483","1177-5467"],"journal":"Clinical Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1493721176,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/reduction-in-bacterial-load-using-hypochlorous-acid-hygiene-solution-o-peer-reviewed-article-OPTH","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28458509?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=36026","pmcid":"PMC5402722","pmid":"28458509","pubdate":"2017-04-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Reduction in bacterial load using hypochlorous acid hygiene solution on ocular skin","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reduction-bacterial-load-using-hypochlorous-acid-hygiene-solution-ocular-skin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8161363,"mean":6.8964925866473,"rank":3854269,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4126190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8161363,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235448,"mean":12.575391344973,"rank":109602,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":118692,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235448,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1277,"mean":2.6533996865204,"rank":339,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":858,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1277,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":1.705,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Microbiome_Art\/statuses\/859302111342940160","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19774678],"posted_on":"2017-05-02T07:02:43+00:00","author":{"name":"Microbiome Articles","url":"https:\/\/maximeborry.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/778305348469919744\/Kq4NuIyd_normal.jpg","description":"A bot retrieving and twitting all the latest Microbiome articles from PubMed.\nMade by @notmaxib","id_on_source":"Microbiome_Art","tweeter_id":"778208387754582018","geo":{"lt":48.84598,"ln":2.20289,"country":"FR"},"followers":384},"tweet_id":"859302111342940160"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MicrobiomePaper\/statuses\/859355015047028738","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19774678],"posted_on":"2017-05-02T10:32:56+00:00","author":{"name":"Microbiome Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/585212126173732865\/jEvg1KpB_normal.jpg","description":"The latest PubMed publications on Microbiome Research delivered direct to your Twitter Feed.
