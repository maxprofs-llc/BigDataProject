Interventions targeting attention or FAR per se have invariably yielded improved FAR performance in these patients. Here, we compared the effects of two interventions, one targeting FAR and one targeting attention-to-facial-features, with treatment-as-usual on patients' FAR performance. Thirty-nine outpatients with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to one of three groups: FAR intervention (training to recognize emotional information, conveyed by changes in facial features), attention-to-facial-features intervention (training to detect changes in facial features), and treatment-as-usual. Also, 24 healthy controls, matched for age and education, were assigned to one of the two interventions. Two FAR measurements, baseline and post-intervention, were conducted using an original experimental procedure with alternative sets of stimuli. We found improved FAR performance following the intervention targeting FAR in comparison to the other patient groups, which in fact was comparable to the pre-intervention performance of healthy controls in the corresponding intervention group. This improvement was more pronounced in recognizing fear. Our findings suggest that compared to interventions targeting attention, and treatment-as-usual, training programs targeting FAR can be more effective in improving FAR in patients with schizophrenia, particularly assisting them in perceiving threat-related information more accurately.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033d2","authors":["Stella Tsotsi","Mary H.
