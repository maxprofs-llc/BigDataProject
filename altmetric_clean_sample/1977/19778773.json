One pivotal intracellular stimulus causing senescence is DNA damage response, while the senescence-associated heterochromatin in cancer limits the strength of the DNA damage response to endogenous genotoxic stress or DNA-damaging agents. Therefore, targeting the maintenance of compacted chromatin in cancer cells represents an optional intervention to improve the therapeutic efficacy in cancer treatment. Given a crosstalk between methionine cycle and histone methylation, we hypothesize that pharmacologically disrupting methylation potential, defined as the ratio of cellular S-adenosylmethionine to S-adenosylhomocysteine, could affect the chromatin structures in cancer cells and thus enhance their sensitivity to DNA damage response signaling. Our results showed that 3-deazaneplanocin A, a chemical inhibitor of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, elicited a typical cellular senescence in hepatoma cells. Therapy-induced senescence by 3-deazaneplanocin A was mediated through p53-p21 pathway and triggered by enhanced ataxia-telangiectasia mutated activation related to chromatin changes. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that metabolic perturbation of chromatin status in oncogene-activated cancers could be an optional intervention to sensitize DNA damage response signaling.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008c15","authors":["Guozhen Wu","Ning Wang","Ying Luo","Yanyan Zhang","Peng Wang","Zhengyan Zhu","Yingtang Gao","Zhi Du","Bin Yang"],"doi":"10.1177\/1010428317699117","first_seen_on":"2017-05-02T10:39:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1010-4283","1423-0380"],"issue":"5","journal":"Tumor Biology","last_mentioned_on":1493721161,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28459194?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28459194","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Metabolic perturbation of epigenome by inhibiting S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase elicits senescence through DNA damage response in hepatoma cells","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metabolic-perturbation-epigenome-inhibiting-isi-adenosylhomocysteine-hydrolase-elicits-senescence-th"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8161363,"mean":6.8964925866473,"rank":7066946,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8161363,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235448,"mean":12.575395592214,"rank":191302,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235448,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1974,"mean":1.2589711099848,"rank":1156,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1974,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160,"mean":2.9601383647799,"rank":83,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
