Consequently, guidelines for medical device therapy were established for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but not for conditions with only anecdotal evidence of arrhythmias, like Fabry cardiomyopathy. Patients with Fabry cardiomyopathy progressively develop myocardial fibrosis, and sudden cardiac death occurs regularly. Because 24-hour Holter electrocardiograms (ECGs) might not detect clinically important arrhythmias, we tested an implanted loop recorder for continuous heart rhythm surveillance and determined its impact on therapy. This prospective study included 16 patients (12 men) with advanced Fabry cardiomyopathy, relevant hypertrophy, and replacement fibrosis in \"loco typico.\" No patients previously exhibited clinically relevant arrhythmias on Holter ECGs. Patients received an implantable loop recorder and were prospectively followed with telemedicine for a median of 1.2\u00a0years (range 0.3 to 2.0\u00a0years). The primary end point was a clinically meaningful event, which required a therapy change, captured with the loop recorder. Patients submitted data regularly (14 \u00b1 11 times per month). During follow-up, 21 events were detected (including 4 asystole, i.e., ECG pauses \u22653\u00a0seconds) and 7 bradycardia events; 5 episodes of intermittent atrial fibrillation (>3\u00a0minutes) and 5 episodes of ventricular tachycardia (3 sustained and 2 nonsustained). Subsequently, as defined in the primary end point, 15 events leaded to a change of therapy. These patients required therapy with a pacemaker or cardioverter-defibrillator implantation and\/or anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation. In conclusion, clinically relevant arrhythmias that require further device and\/or medical therapy are often missed with Holter ECGs in patients with advanced stage Fabry cardiomyopathy, but they can be detected by telemonitoring with\u00a0an\u00a0implantable loop recorder.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021f0","authors":["Frank Weidemann","Sebastian K.G.
