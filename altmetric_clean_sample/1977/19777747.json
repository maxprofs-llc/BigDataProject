However, it is strongly influenced by the relatively low resolution of the cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images used in clinical practice. In this paper, we propose a super-resolution classification method, which refines a given initial segmentation of the facial nerve to a sub-voxel classification level from CBCT\/CT images. The super-resolution classification method learns the mapping from low-resolution CBCT\/CT images to high-resolution facial nerve label images, obtained from manual segmentation on micro-CT images. We present preliminary results on dataset, 15 ex-vivo samples scanned including pairs of CBCT\/CT scans and high-resolution micro-CT scans, with a Leave-One-Out (LOO) evaluation, and manual segmentations on micro-CT images as ground truth. Our experiments achieved a segmentation accuracy with a Dice coefficient of 0.818 \u00b10.052 , surface-to-surface distance of 0.121 \u00b10.030mm and Hausdorff distance of 0.715 \u00b10.169mm . We compared the proposed technique to two other semi-automated segmentation software tools, ITK-SNAP and GeoS, and show the ability of the proposed approach to yield sub-voxel levels of accuracy in delineating the facial nerve.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a47","authors":["Ping Lu","Livia Barazzetti","Vimal Chandran","Kate Gavaghan","Stefan Weber","Nicolas Gerber","Mauricio Reyes"],"doi":"10.1109\/tbme.2017.2697916","first_seen_on":"2017-05-02T10:02:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0018-9294","1558-2531"],"journal":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","last_mentioned_on":1494054920,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28459680?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/abstract\/document\/7911203\/?reload=true"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/iel7\/10\/4359967\/07911203.pdf","pmid":"28459680","pubdate":"2017-05-02T22:02:04+00:00","publisher":"IEEE","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Artificial Intelligence And Image Processing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Highly accurate Facial Nerve Segmentation Refinement from CBCT\/CT Imaging using a Super Resolution Classification Approach","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highly-accurate-facial-nerve-segmentation-refinement-cbctct-imaging-using-super-resolution-classific"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8166192,"mean":6.9129712202356,"rank":4091715,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3866914,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8166192,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236493,"mean":12.600914627133,"rank":119867,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":106506,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236493,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":696,"mean":4.0321208633094,"rank":308,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":374,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":696,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":2.3333333333333,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CH":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SRMicro_papers\/statuses\/859346795142553600","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19777747],"posted_on":"2017-05-02T10:00:16+00:00","author":{"name":"Super Res Microscopy","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/789566896286728192\/otGAZOp0_normal.jpg","description":"Twitterbot for anything related to super resolution microscopy","id_on_source":"SRMicro_papers","tweeter_id":"2372788392","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":496},"tweet_id":"859346795142553600"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/mreyesag\/statuses\/860754840582070272","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19777747],"posted_on":"2017-05-06T07:15:20+00:00","author":{"name":"Mauricio Reyes","url":"http:\/\/mauricioreyes.me","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2956203923\/c990a3e855e061385a0759d1ba21fc8f_normal.jpeg","description":"Hi, I am an electrical engineer with specialisation (Ph.D.) in medical image analysis.
