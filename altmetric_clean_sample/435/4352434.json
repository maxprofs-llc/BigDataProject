This urges the characterization of possible conformational states, different from the fully folded state, potentially able to initiate self-assembly. Under native conditions, profilin-1 is monomeric and possesses a well-defined secondary and tertiary structure. When incubated at low pH or with high urea concentrations, profilin-1 remains monomeric but populates unfolded states exhibiting larger hydrodynamic radius and disordered structure, as assessed by dynamic light scattering, far-UV circular dichroism and intrinsic fluorescence. Refolding from the urea-unfolded state was studied at equilibrium and in real-time using a stopped-flow apparatus. The results obtained with intrinsic fluorescence and circular dichroism indicate a single phase without significant changes of the corresponding signals before the major refolding transition. However, such a transition is preceded by a burst phase with an observed increase of ANS fluorescence, which indicates the conversion into a transiently populated collapsed state possessing solvent-exposed hydrophobic clusters. Kinetic analysis reveals that such state has a conformational stability comparable to that of the fully unfolded state. To our knowledge, profilin-1 is the first example of an amyloid-related protein where folding occurs in the absence of thermodynamically stable partially folded states.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Del Poggetto, Edoardo","Chiti, Fabrizio","Bemporad, Francesco","Edoardo Del Poggetto","Fabrizio Chiti","Francesco Bemporad"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep12332","first_seen_on":"2015-08-01T10:31:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1469786889,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26227615?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26227615","pubdate":"2015-08-01T22:01:10+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Protein aggregation","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Kinetics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Thermodynamics","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"The Folding process of Human Profilin-1, a novel protein associated with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep12332","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/folding-process-human-profilin1-novel-protein-associated-familial-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8154593,"mean":6.8923629076653,"rank":6199065,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1092931,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8154593,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230312,"mean":8.5209812470964,"rank":159188,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":38705,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230312,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33868,"mean":14.89717760652,"rank":24691,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":5313,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33868,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1688,"mean":12.889919383521,"rank":1256,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":260,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1688,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":4,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":5,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":4}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/assembly_papers\/status\/627426326303997952","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4352434],"posted_on":"2015-08-01T10:31:07+00:00","author":{"name":"assemblypapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/439371508528320512\/TDJfUNti_normal.png","description":"Papers on directed and self assembly","id_on_source":"assembly_papers","tweeter_id":"2364079946","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":332},"tweet_id":"627426326303997952"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/assembly_papers\/statuses\/758967340956422146","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4352434],"posted_on":"2016-07-29T10:08:09+00:00","author":{"name":"assemblypapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/439371508528320512\/TDJfUNti_normal.png","description":"Papers on directed and self assembly","id_on_source":"assembly_papers","tweeter_id":"2364079946","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":332},"tweet_id":"758967340956422146"}]}}
