We employed a multisession MSL paradigm to investigate whether behavioral deficits in learning and consolidation appear immediately after or prior to the detection of clinical symptoms in the tested (left) hand. Specifically, our patient sample was limited to recently diagnosed patients with pure unilateral PD. The left hand symptomatic (LH-S) patients provided an assessment of performance following the onset of clinical symptoms in the tested hand. Conversely, right hand affected (left hand asymptomatic, LH-A) patients served to investigate whether MSL impairments appear before symptoms in the tested hand. LH-S patients demonstrated impaired learning during the initial training session and both LH-S and LH-A patients demonstrated decreased performance compared to controls during the next-day retest. Critically, the impairments in later learning stages in the LH-A patients were evident even before the appearance of traditional clinical symptoms in the tested hand. Results may be explained by the progression of disease-related alterations in relevant corticostriatal networks.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Dan, Xiaojuan","King, Bradley R","Doyon, Julien","Chan, Piu"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0134291","first_seen_on":"2015-07-31T16:12:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"7","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1438877040,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26222151","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0134291"],"pmid":"26222151","pubdate":"2015-07-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Motor Sequence Learning and Consolidation in Unilateral  De Novo  Patients with Parkinson\u2019s Disease","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/motor-sequence-learning-consolidation-unilateral-novo-patients-parkinsons-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5450554,"mean":6.3470462938347,"rank":572664,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":4873711,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5450554,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190293,"mean":8.7434019822169,"rank":28793,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":161216,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190293,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94840,"mean":9.6161804742775,"rank":14145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":80574,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94840,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6173,"mean":8.4402469215813,"rank":862,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":5305,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6173,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
