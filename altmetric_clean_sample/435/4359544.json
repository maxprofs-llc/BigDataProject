This study aims to examine the patterns of outpatient and inpatient health care utilization across different demographic and socioeconomic groups in older people with cardiovascular disease in China.\nData were from World Health Organization (WHO) Study on Global Aging and Adult Health (SAGE) Wave 1. Chinese older people aged over 50\u00a0years with cardiovascular disease were included in the analysis. Outpatient and inpatient care utilization rates were presented and compared by demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the association between socioeconomic factors and health care utilization.\nIn total, 4162 older people with cardiovascular disease in SAGE China Wave 1 were included in the analysis. 86.4\u00a0% of them had health insurance. 54.9\u00a0% of the patients received outpatient care and 17.7\u00a0% received inpatient care over the past 12\u00a0months. Outpatient care utilization rate was significantly associated with age. Patients in older groups used more outpatient care than those in younger groups (p\u2009=\u20090.010). Inpatient care utilization rate peaked at 70-79 years group (23.2\u00a0%), and then reduced to 17.5\u00a0% in 80\u00a0years plus group. Rich patients used more outpatient service than the poorer (p\u2009<\u20090.001). No association was found between household wealth status and inpatient service utilization.\nWithin the context of high health insurance coverage in China, the pattern of outpatient care utilization differs from that of inpatient care utilization among older patients aged over 50\u00a0years old with cardiovascular disease. Patients tend to use more outpatient care as they became older. As for inpatient care, the oldest patients aged over 80\u00a0years use less inpatient care than the 70-79 group. Household economic status plays an important role in outpatient care utilization, but it shows no association with inpatient care utilization in Chinese older patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000838","authors":["Lixia Dou","Xiaoyun Liu","Tuohong Zhang","Yangfeng Wu"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12939-015-0190-y","first_seen_on":"2015-08-04T09:20:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1475-9276"],"journal":"International Journal for Equity in Health","last_mentioned_on":1438680017,"links":["http:\/\/www.equityhealthj.com\/content\/14\/1\/59"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.equityhealthj.com\/content\/pdf\/s12939-015-0190-y.pdf","pmid":"26219955","pubdate":"2015-07-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Development Economics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Quality of Life Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Social Policy","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth","healthservices"],"title":"Health care utilization in older people with cardiovascular disease in China","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/health-care-utilization-older-people-cardiovascular-disease-china-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5441762,"mean":6.3365278544923,"rank":2891494,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1848880,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5441762,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189880,"mean":8.8574194513349,"rank":103441,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":67891,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189880,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":526,"mean":5.7818057142857,"rank":359,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":98,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":526,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":6.325,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
