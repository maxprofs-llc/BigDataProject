Analysis of the type and incidence of pathological changes observed macroscopically during FESS was undertaken as well as an parallel attempt to correlate the level of inflammation markers with severity of disease.\nRetrospective analysis of case records of 153 patients of the Department of Pediatric Otolaryngology, Medical University of Warsaw, hospitalized between 2010 and 2013. During that time 106 patients with a diagnosis of chronic maxillary sinusitis required surgical intervention. 102 children (avg-aged 11.5 years) were qualified to functional endoscopic surgery. The youngest patient was 3 years old and the oldest 18. 26 patients presented the polypoid lesions of sinuses or nasals. At 19 confirmed the coexistence of sinus polyps with nasal polyps.\n76 patients had oedematous-inflammatory lesions and 26 polypoid. Among the group of listed above 26 children, 19 had either sinuses or nasal polyps. 15% children with polyps were diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and 8.0% with asthma. A common deviation in the results of morphology in children with CRSs is higher level of monocytes. Inflammation markers within the population of FESS qualified children were low.\n(1) Oedematous-inflammatory lesions are frequently intraoperatively identified. (2) The CRSs without polyps is the common type of chronic sinusitis in children. (3) Nasal polyps often coexist with sinus polyps. (4) If nasal polyps are found in pediatric population then diagnosis of CF, allergy and GERD should be considered. (5) Markers of inflammation in CRSs are low.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b88","authors":["Chmielik, Lechoslaw Pawel","Raczkowska-Labuda, Karolina","Zawadzka-Glos, Lidia"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijporl.2015.07.015","first_seen_on":"2015-08-04T10:03:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1872-8464"],"journal":"International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology","last_mentioned_on":1457437688,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26233272?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26233272?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26233272","pubdate":"2015-08-05T22:02:49+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["otolaryngology","pediatrics"],"title":"Macroscopic findings during endoscopic sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis in children.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/macroscopic-findings-during-endoscopic-sinus-surgery-chronic-rhinosinusitis-children"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7367623,"mean":6.4006371575483,"rank":3240938,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4054743,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7367623,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":225501,"mean":8.3159327184036,"rank":91529,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":129551,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":225501,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1630,"mean":1.9512915899325,"rank":410,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":1182,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1630,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":1.5762295081967,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":44,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ACNPed\/status\/628506449644138496","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4359700],"posted_on":"2015-08-04T10:03:09+00:00","author":{"name":"ACNP","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1687251577\/logo_normal.png","description":"Asociaci\u00f3n Colombiana de Neumolog\u00eda Pedi\u00e1trica","id_on_source":"ACNPed","tweeter_id":"434250807","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":157},"tweet_id":"628506449644138496"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/OTO_docs\/status\/628638170964299776","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4359700],"posted_on":"2015-08-04T18:46:34+00:00","author":{"name":"OTOdocs","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/451475015045615617\/pvQ7oTD5_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Otolaryngology papers in #PubMed and #arXiv.","id_on_source":"OTO_docs","tweeter_id":"2424371810","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":389},"tweet_id":"628638170964299776"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/asthma_papers\/statuses\/707171038660956164","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4359700],"posted_on":"2016-03-08T11:48:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Asthma Papers","url":"https:\/\/github.com\/roblanf\/phypapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/439482171208646656\/OWe4b0kE_normal.jpeg","description":"RSS feed for #asthma papers in #Pubmed.
