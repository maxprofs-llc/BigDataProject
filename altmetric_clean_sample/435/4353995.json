Recently, the subgroup of 6-5-6-5-6-membered ETPs has gained substantial attention, which has resulted in several total syntheses. Despite all the efforts that have been invested into accessing these complex structures, no synthesis of scabrosin diacetate (1\u2009a) and its related esters has been reported. Herein, our attempts towards scabrosin diacetate (1\u2009a) and haematocin (3) starting from diketopiperazine 12\u2009a as a late-stage intermediate are presented. Diketopiperazine 12\u2009a can be conveniently accessed in multigram quantities from aldehyde 18 and diketopiperazine 21 and was envisioned to serve as a general platform for the synthesis of 6-5-6-5-6-membered ETPs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Zipfel, Hannes F.","Carreira, Erick M.","Zipfel, Hannes F","Carreira, Erick M","Hannes F.
