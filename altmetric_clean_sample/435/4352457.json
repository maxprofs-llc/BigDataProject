However, controversy continues to exist regarding the incremental benefit of broadly applied BIMA grafting in elderly patients.\nRetrospective analysis was conducted of 4,503 consecutive isolated coronary artery bypass grafting operations (SIMA, n\u00a0= 2,340 and BIMA, n\u00a0= 2,163) performed from 1972 to 1994. Multivariate analysis was used to created propensity score-matched groups of SIMA (n\u00a0= 1,063) and BIMA (n\u00a0= 1,063) to compare patients 65 years of age and older, and 70 years of age and older (n\u00a0= 612), with similar baseline characteristics. Survival status was obtained by periodic follow-up, query of the US National Death Index, and other Internet searches, and was 99.6% complete.\nThe propensity score-matched groups experienced similar perioperative mortality and morbidity. Survival benefits were found for BIMA versus SIMA grafting across both age categories. Actuarial curves after 23,593 patient-years of follow-up (mean BIMA\u00a0= 11.7 years; 6 weeks to 33.1 years; mean SIMA\u00a0= 10.5 years; 6 weeks to 30.7 years) demonstrated improved long-term survival for BIMA versus SIMA patients at 12 years (51.0 \u00b1 1.5% versus 39.0 \u00b1 1.5%) and at 24 years (3.5 \u00b1 0.7% versus 4.5 \u00b1 0.7%; p < 0.001). Similarly, in\u00a0matched groups of patients age 70 and older, overall survival was also enhanced with BIMA grafting (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005).\nAdvanced age should not be a contraindication for BIMA grafting. Long-term follow-up clearly demonstrates that BIMA grafting when broadly applied in elderly patients results in improved long-term survival over SIMA grafting.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a35","authors":["Kurlansky, Paul A","Traad, Ernest A","Dorman, Malcolm J","Galbut, David L","Ebra, George"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.athoracsur.2015.04.019","first_seen_on":"2015-08-01T10:32:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1552-6259","0003-4975"],"journal":"The Annals of Thoracic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1442879096,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26228600?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.annalsthoracicsurgery.org\/article\/S0003-4975(15)00621-9\/abstract?rss=yes"],"pmid":"26228600","pubdate":"2015-08-01T22:00:50+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Bilateral Versus Single Internal Mammary Artery Grafting in the Elderly: Long-Term Survival Benefit","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bilateral-versus-single-internal-mammary-artery-grafting-elderly-longterm-survival-benefit"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6381123,"mean":5.8517482508552,"rank":2810684,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3398648,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6381123,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195117,"mean":8.7850443736034,"rank":96843,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":89709,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195117,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2684,"mean":2.8078613492359,"rank":791,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":1802,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2684,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":129,"mean":2.98359375,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":75,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":129,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/status\/627419520664121344","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4352457],"posted_on":"2015-08-01T10:04:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":439},"tweet_id":"627419520664121344"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/erodcauCCV\/statuses\/646103905869373440","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4352457],"posted_on":"2015-09-21T23:29:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Emiliano Rodr\u00edguez","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/586471063237722112\/kBjdsGOI_normal.jpg","description":"Padre, esposo, hijo,hermano, amigo, m\u00e9dico, cirujano, doctor, futbolista...MD, PhD, FETCS","id_on_source":"erodcauCCV","tweeter_id":"1492693657","geo":{"lt":36.77262,"ln":-4.10045,"country":"ES"},"followers":198},"tweet_id":"646103905869373440"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/tssmn\/statuses\/646107877090983936","license":"gnip","rt":["erodcauCCV"],"citation_ids":[4352457],"posted_on":"2015-09-21T23:44:56+00:00","author":{"name":"CTSurgSocMedNetwork","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/604007318770995200\/Kz4G2NYe_normal.jpg","description":"To promote scholarship published in (@annalsthorsurg) and (@AATSjournals) in social media, and to highlight our field\u2019s accomplishments.","id_on_source":"tssmn","tweeter_id":"3229136989","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1041},"tweet_id":"646107877090983936"}]}}
