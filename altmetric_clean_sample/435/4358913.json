The stability measurements were performed immediately after implant placement (T0 = 64.5 \u00b1 6.6 ISQ) and 1 year (T1 = mean 66.8 \u00b1 4.2 ISQ), and 7 years (T7 = mean 62.8 \u00b1 5.4) after being in function. The analysis of the RFA values showed a statistically significant decrease in implant stability after 7 years in function, although the final values are considered adequate for treatment success. Panoramic x-ray examination showed bone loss greater than the first thread in 10 implants.\nAccording to the obtained data, it can be concluded that immediate loading according to this protocol with prefabricated bars is a valid treatment option for edentulous patients providing sufficient long-term success.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f45","authors":["Moreira Melo, Ana Cl\u00e1udia","Toscano, Ricardo","Vieira, Rog\u00e9ria Acedo","de Mattias Sartori, Ivete Aparecida","Bernardes, S\u00e9rgio Rocha","Thom\u00e9, Geninho"],"doi":"10.1097\/id.0000000000000266","first_seen_on":"2015-08-04T03:01:09+00:00","issns":["1538-2982","1056-6163"],"issue":"4","journal":"Implant Dentistry","last_mentioned_on":1439517067,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/implantdent\/Abstract\/2015\/08000\/Immediate_Loading_of_Edentulous_Mandible_With.18.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/implantdent\/2015\/08000\/Immediate_Loading_of_Edentulous_Mandible_With.18.pdf","pmid":"25974122","pubdate":"2015-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"472","subjects":["dentistry","generalsurgery"],"title":"Immediate Loading of Edentulous Mandible With Prefabricated Bars: A Long-Term Study of 7 Years","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/immediate-loading-edentulous-mandible-prefabricated-bars-longterm-study-7-years"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5482709,"mean":6.3665781128594,"rank":3858200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":921665,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5482709,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192454,"mean":8.8018747122675,"rank":132907,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":38175,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192454,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":865,"mean":0.87563657407407,"rank":300,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":865,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":1.0134615384615,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
