The aim of this study was to determine how the twice-daily treatment with blue light affects the development and composition of a matrix-rich biofilm.\nBiofilms of Streptococcus mutans UA159 were formed on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite discs for 5 days. The biofilms were exposed twice-daily to non-coherent blue light (LumaCare; 420 nm) without a photosensitizer. The distance between the light and the sample was 1.0 cm; energy density of 72 J cm-2; and exposure time of 12 min 56 s. Positive and negative controls were twice-daily 0.12% chlorhexidine (CHX) and 0.89% NaCl, respectively. Biofilms were analyzed for bacterial viability, dry-weight, and extra (EPS-insoluble and soluble) and intracellular (IPS) polysaccharides. Variable pressure scanning electron microscopy and confocal scanning laser microscopy were used to check biofilm morphology and bacterial viability, respectively. When biofilms were exposed to twice-daily blue light, EPS-insoluble was reduced significantly more than in either control group (CHX and 0.89% NaCl). Bacterial viability and dry weight were also reduced relative to the negative control (0.89% NaCl) when the biofilms were treated with twice-daily blue light. Different morphology was also visible when the biofilms were treated with blue light.\nTwice-daily treatment with blue light without a photosensitizer is a promising mechanism for the inhibition of matrix-rich biofilm development.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Lins de Sousa, Denise","Ara\u00fajo Lima, Ramille","Zanin, Iriana Carla","Klein, Marlise I","Janal, Malvin N","Duarte, Simone"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0131941","first_seen_on":"2015-08-01T10:30:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"7","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1438479000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26230333?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0131941"],"pmid":"26230333","pubdate":"2015-08-01T22:00:21+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Effect of Twice-Daily Blue Light Treatment on Matrix-Rich Biofilm Development","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-twicedaily-blue-light-treatment-matrixrich-biofilm-development"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5428000,"mean":6.3206828302661,"rank":3593770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1608445,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5428000,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190039,"mean":8.8038766036267,"rank":122426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":58560,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190039,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94492,"mean":9.610487644326,"rank":64207,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":25888,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94492,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6186,"mean":8.4502800323363,"rank":4217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1626,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6186,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
