Coping resources, particularly prior mental health and social support, were the best predictors of low scores on subscales of the Perinatal Grief Scale that indicate chronic grief reactions. Results also offer some evidence of delayed grief responses, especially among men and those who experienced early losses.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002206","authors":["Lasker, J N","Toedter, L J"],"first_seen_on":"2015-08-03T20:11:10+00:00","issns":["0002-9432"],"issue":"4","journal":"American Journal of Orthopsychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1438631739,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1746627"],"pmid":"1746627","pubdate":"1991-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry","psychology"],"title":"Acute versus chronic grief: the case of pregnancy loss.","type":"article","volume":"61","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/acute-versus-chronic-grief-case-pregnancy-loss"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5436647,"mean":6.3270035691119,"rank":540444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":4873297,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5436647,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189976,"mean":8.8410977233848,"rank":27744,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":161589,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189976,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":344,"mean":4.7675043731778,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":297,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":344,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":19.064285714286,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
