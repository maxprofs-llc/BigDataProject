Previously, we identified a negative epistatic interaction involving naturally occurring polymorphisms in the MLH1 and PMS1 genes of baker's yeast. Here we hypothesize that a mutagenic state resulting from this negative epistatic interaction increases the likelihood of obtaining beneficial mutations that can promote adaptation to stress conditions. We tested this by stressing yeast strains bearing mutagenic (incompatible) and non-mutagenic (compatible) mismatch repair genotypes. Our data show that incompatible populations adapted more rapidly and without an apparent fitness cost to high salt stress. The fitness advantage of incompatible populations was rapid but disappeared over time. The fitness gains in both compatible and incompatible strains were due primarily to mutations in PMR1 that appeared earlier in incompatible evolving populations. These data demonstrate a rapid and reversible role (by mating) for genetic incompatibilities in accelerating adaptation in eukaryotes. They also provide an approach to link experimental studies to observational population genomics.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000334a","authors":["Bui, Duyen T","Dine, Elliot","Anderson, James B","Aquadro, Charles F","Alani, Eric E"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pgen.1005407","first_seen_on":"2015-08-01T12:07:39+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms"],"issns":["1553-7404"],"issue":"7","journal":"PLoS Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1439906170,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26230253?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosgenetics\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1005407","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosgenetics\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pgen.1005407"],"pmid":"26230253","pubdate":"2015-08-01T22:00:22+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"A Genetic Incompatibility Accelerates Adaptation in Yeast","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genetic-incompatibility-accelerates-adaptation-yeast"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5558092,"mean":6.324208653655,"rank":1287864,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":4247348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5558092,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192975,"mean":8.7677105102243,"rank":55355,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":136868,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192975,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4661,"mean":10.334943776824,"rank":2086,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2516,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4661,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":188,"mean":7.7772727272727,"rank":83,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":103,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":188,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
