Though factor substitution therapy has greatly improved the lives of hemophiliac patients, there are still limitations to the current treatment that have triggered interest in alternative treatments by gene therapy. Significant progress has recently been made in the development of gene therapy for the treatment of hemophilia A and B. These advances parallel the technical improvements of existing vector systems including MoMLV-based retroviral, adenoviral and AAV vectors, and the development of new delivery methods such as lentiviral vectors, helper-dependent adenoviral vectors and improved non-viral gene delivery methods. Therapeutic and physiologic levels of FVIII and FIX could be achieved in FVIII- and FIX-deficient mice and hemophilia dogs by different gene therapy approaches. Long-term correction of the bleeding disorders and in some cases a permanent cure has been realized in these preclinical studies. However, the induction of neutralizing antibodies often precludes stable phenotypic correction. Another complication is that certain promoters are prone to transcriptional inactivation in vivo, precluding long-term FVIII or FIX expression. Several gene therapy phase I clinical trials are currently ongoing in patients suffering from severe hemophilia A or B. No significant adverse side-effects were reported, and semen samples were negative for vector sequences by sensitive PCR assays. Most importantly, some subjects report fewer bleeding episodes and occasionally have very low levels of clotting factor activity detected. The results from the extensive preclinical studies in normal and hemophilic animal models and encouraging preliminary clinical data indicate that the simultaneous development of different strategies is likely to bring a permanent cure for hemophilia one step closer to reality.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c9a","authors":["Chuah, M K","Collen, D","VandenDriessche, T"],"doi":"10.1002\/1521-2254(200101\/02)3:1<3::aid-jgm167>3.0.co;2-h","first_seen_on":"2015-08-04T08:31:43+00:00","issns":["1099-498X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Gene Medicine - Gene Therapy Clinical Trial Database","last_mentioned_on":1438677052,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11269333"],"pmid":"11269333","pubdate":"2001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","geneticsmedical"],"title":"Gene therapy for hemophilia.","type":"article","volume":"3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5441762,"mean":6.3365278544923,"rank":2891493,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1848881,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5441762,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189881,"mean":8.8573749104699,"rank":103441,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":67891,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189881,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":6.4681818181818,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":4.942,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ProfAliAltimimi\/status\/628483226391019520","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4359424],"posted_on":"2015-08-04T08:30:52+00:00","author":{"name":"ProfDr.AliAltimimi","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/449866851493744640\/InbwytLD_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"ProfAliAltimimi","tweeter_id":"406437864","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":29},"tweet_id":"628483226391019520"}]}}
