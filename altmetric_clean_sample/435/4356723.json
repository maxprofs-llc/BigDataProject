Twenty-four patients were dialysis-dependent.\nThe 100-day and the 6, and 12-month treatment-related mortality was 0%. Overall response rate was 92%. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 1.9 years and 3.8 years, respectively. A multivariate analysis was not performed because of the small sample size. Only 3 patients became dialysis-independent after transplantation. Cardiac, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, infectious, neurologic, and pulmonary \"all grade\" toxicities were all higher in the melphalan 200 group versus\u00a0< 200 group, however, none of them were statistically significant.\nBecause of a lack of clear survival benefit with higher-dose melphalan and potential higher toxicity in this group, it is reasonable to use lower-dose melphalan in dialysis-dependent myeloma patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000580a","authors":["El Fakih, Riad","Fox, Patricia","Popat, Uday","Nieto, Yago","Shah, Nina","Parmar, Simrit","Oran, Betul","Ciurea, Stephan","Kebriaei, Partow","Hosing, Chitra","Ahmed, Sairah","Shah, Jatin","Orlowski, Robert","Champlin, Richard","Qazilbash, Muzaffar","Bashir, Qaiser","Riad El Fakih","Patricia Fox","Uday Popat","Yago Nieto","Nina Shah","Simrit Parmar","Betul Oran","Stephan Ciurea","Partow Kebriaei","Chitra Hosing","Sairah Ahmed","Jatin Shah","Robert Orlowski","Richard Champlin","Muzaffar Qazilbash","Qaiser Bashir"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.clml.2015.03.003","endpage":"476","first_seen_on":"2015-08-03T12:38:19+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["2152-2669","2152-2650","21522650"],"issue":"8","journal":"Clinical Lymphoma, Myeloma & Leukemia","last_mentioned_on":1439386698,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25963284","http:\/\/www.clinical-lymphoma-myeloma-leukemia.com\/article\/S2152-2650%2815%2900108-1\/abstract"],"pmid":"25963284","pubdate":"2015-01-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"472","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Dialysis-Dependent Myeloma Patients","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S2152265015001081","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/autologous-hematopoietic-stem-cell-transplantation-dialysisdependent-myeloma-patients-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.45,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7419627,"mean":6.4515132245167,"rank":1682888,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":5727947,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7419627,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":226082,"mean":8.3381543606053,"rank":61941,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":163669,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":226082,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":340,"mean":2.3056342182891,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":281,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":340,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.76125,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":3}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/FrancescoTurtu1\/status\/628183016607649792","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4356723],"posted_on":"2015-08-03T12:37:56+00:00","author":{"name":"Francesco Turturro","url":"http:\/\/faculty.mdanderson.org\/Francesco_Turturro\/Default.asp?SNID=1484660469","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/763530448618217472\/8el8ozjZ_normal.jpg","description":"Lymphoma specialist expressing his own opinions","id_on_source":"FrancescoTurtu1","tweeter_id":"1191609930","geo":{"lt":29.76328,"ln":-95.36327,"country":"US"},"followers":968},"tweet_id":"628183016607649792"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Transplant_Doc\/status\/628571952165195776","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4356723],"posted_on":"2015-08-04T14:23:26+00:00","author":{"name":"Muzaffar Qazilbash","url":"http:\/\/faculty.mdanderson.org\/Muzaffar_Qazilbash\/Default.asp","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1805143659\/Profile_compressed_pic-_020412_normal.jpg","description":"Stem Cell Transplant physician and clinical researcher at MD Anderson Cancer Center; special interest in myeloma.
