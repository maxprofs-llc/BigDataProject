Mucinous carcinoma of the breast is an uncommon form of breast tumor, often presenting as a lobulated, moderately well circumscribed mass on mammography, sonography, and MRI imaging. It accounts for 1 to 7% of all breast cancers. Pure mucinous breast carcinomas are rare and account for about 2% of all primary breast carcinomas. Metastatic disease happens at a lower rate than in other types of invasive carcinoma.\nWe present our 5 year experience with this particular pathology in a retrospective review study.\nWe identified 25 patients with mixed and pure mucinous breast cancer, the tumor size varied greatly from 2 to 19 cm in diameter. A subset of mixed mucinous carcinomas (8 cases) showed neuroendocrine differentiation or other associated premalignant lessions.\nMucinous carcinoma of the breast is a rare entity with a favorable prognosis due to low incidence of lymph node metastases. Pure mucinous breast carcinoma has an even rare.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52d3cf058f6100041a3","authors":["Dumitru, Adrian","Procop, Alexandru","Iliesiu, Andreea","Tampa, Mircea","Mitrache, Luminita","Costache, Mariana","Sajin, Maria","Lazaroiu, Anca","Cirstoiu, Monica"],"first_seen_on":"2015-08-01T10:32:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1841-9038"],"issue":"1","journal":"Maedica - a Journal of Clinical Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1438423416,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26225144?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26225144","pubdate":"2015-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Mucinous Breast Cancer: a Review Study of 5 Year Experience from a Hospital-Based Series of Cases.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mucinous-breast-cancer-review-study-5-year-experience-hospitalbased-series-cases-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5428238,"mean":6.3205410113826,"rank":2883346,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1845133,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5428238,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190045,"mean":8.8036136473659,"rank":103710,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":67788,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190045,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":2.9358620689655,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dermatologyf\/status\/627419398928633856","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4352486],"posted_on":"2015-08-01T10:03:36+00:00","author":{"name":"dermatologyf","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2046835740\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Dermatology News","id_on_source":"dermatologyf","tweeter_id":"546505902","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":62},"tweet_id":"627419398928633856"}]}}
