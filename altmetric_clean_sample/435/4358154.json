See"],"citation":{"abstract":"A water-THF biphasic system containing N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) was found to enable the efficient synthesis of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) from a variety of sugars (simple to complex) using phosphated TiO2 as a catalyst. Fructose and glucose were selectively converted to HMF resulting in 98\u2009% and 90\u2009% yield, respectively, at 175\u2009\u00b0C. Cellobiose and sucrose also gave rise to high HMF yields of 94\u2009% and 98\u2009%, respectively, at 180\u2009\u00b0C. Other sugar variants such as starch (potato and rice) and cellulose were also investigated. The yields of HMF from starch (80-85\u2009%) were high, whereas cellulose resulted in a modest yield of 33\u2009%. Direct transformation of cellulose to HMF in significant yield (86\u2009%) was assisted by mechanocatalytic depolymerization-ball milling of acid-impregnated cellulose. This effectively reduced cellulose crystallinity and particle size, forming soluble cello-oligomers; this is responsible for the enhanced substrate-catalytic sites contact and subsequent rate of HMF formation. During catalyst recyclability, P-TiO2 was observed to be reusable for four cycles without any loss in activity. We also investigated the conversion of the cello-oligomers to HMF in a continuous flow reactor. Good HMF yield (53\u2009%) was achieved using a water-methyl isobutyl ketone+NMP biphasic system.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e64","authors":["Atanda, Luqman","Shrotri, Abhijit","Mukundan, Swathi","Ma, Qing","Konarova, Muxina","Beltramini, Jorge"],"doi":"10.1002\/cssc.201500395","endpage":"2916","first_seen_on":"2015-08-03T23:42:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1864-564X"],"issue":"17","journal":"ChemSusChem","last_mentioned_on":1439377458,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cssc.201500395\/abstract;jsessionid=694E20D0830D11D16138AC425A18D690.f04t01","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cssc.201500395\/abstract;jsessionid=598941F4D8BA54847829AF9D9A0DFF2C.f02t03","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cssc.201500395\/abstract;jsessionid=BD4E0FC0C2B4A456C92A8B79B962F78C.f01t02","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cssc.201500395\/abstract;jsessionid=9203D022EA190C82E57411D1BD69D0A8.f01t03?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+have+intermittent+access+on+8th+August+2015+from+10%3A00-16%3A00+BST+%2F+05%3A00-11%3A00+EDT+%2F+17%3A00-23%3A00+SGT+for+essential+maintenance.++Apologies+for+the+inconvenience","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cssc.201500395\/abstract;jsessionid=344B2907A47CB0FC596B32D1CDF9C7AD.f02t01?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+have+intermittent+access+on+8th+August+2015+from+10%3A00-16%3A00+BST+%2F+05%3A00-11%3A00+EDT+%2F+17%3A00-23%3A00+SGT+for+essential+maintenance.++Apologies+for+the+inconvenience","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cssc.201500395\/abstract;jsessionid=38D36A6F9D27A48746E5E311A2849732.f01t01?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+have+intermittent+access+on+8th+August+2015+from+10%3A00-16%3A00+BST+%2F+05%3A00-11%3A00+EDT+%2F+17%3A00-23%3A00+SGT+for+essential+maintenance.++Apologies+for+the+inconvenience","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/cssc.201500395"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cssc.201500395\/pdf","pmid":"26238933","pubdate":"2015-08-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Energy","Materials Science","Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"2907","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Direct Production of 5\u2010Hydroxymethylfurfural via Catalytic Conversion of Simple and Complex Sugars over Phosphated TiO2","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/direct-production-5hydroxymethylfurfural-via-catalytic-conversion-simple-complex-sugars-phosphated-t"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.05,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6407991,"mean":5.985899426497,"rank":952045,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":5453056,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6407991,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190714,"mean":8.9066891926612,"rank":40034,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":150507,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190714,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":863,"mean":3.0666960556845,"rank":123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":740,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":863,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":1.3438461538462,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":63,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":4,"Members of the public":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
