Galanin exerts its biological activities through three different G protein-coupled receptors, GalR1, GalR2 and GalR3. The widespread distribution of galanin and its receptors in the CNS and the various physiological and pharmacological effects of galanin make the galanin receptors attractive drug targets. Areas covered: This review provides an overview of the role of galanin and its receptors in the CNS, the involvement of the galaninergic system in various neurological diseases and the development of new galanin receptor-specific ligands. Expert opinion: Recent advances and novel approaches in migrating the directions of subtype-selective ligand development and chemical modifications of the peptide backbone highlight the importance of the galanin neurochemical system as a potential target for drug development.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073c9","authors":["Freimann, Krista","Kurrikoff, Kaido","Langel, \u00dclo","Krista Freimann","Kaido Kurrikoff","\u00dclo Langel"],"doi":"10.1517\/14728222.2015.1072513","first_seen_on":"2015-07-31T16:12:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1744-7631","1472-8222"],"journal":"Expert Opinion on Therapeutic Targets","last_mentioned_on":1448034852,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26220265","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1517\/14728222.2015.1072513?ai=1obbm&mi=ianpxd&af=R"],"pmid":"26220265","pubdate":"2015-07-31T22:01:08+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Artificial Intelligence And Image Processing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Galanin receptors as a potential target for neurological disease","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/urn.kb.se\/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:su:diva-124911","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/galanin-receptors-potential-target-neurological-disease-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6588247,"mean":6.1137480774097,"rank":644150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":5939417,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6588247,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":198274,"mean":8.8301752331384,"rank":30151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":167812,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":198274,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":529,"mean":1.8860606060606,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":508,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":529,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.4521739130435,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
