Ovalbumin (OVA) is a major component of egg whites, and is a possible cause of egg allergy. In this study, OVA was used as a model protein to develop a delivery system using guanidine-terminated dendrimers (Gdn-den) bearing an amyloid-promoting peptide derived from the helix B (hB) region of OVA (hB-Gdn-den). OVA nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by heat treatment of OVA\/hB-Gdn-den mixtures. The NP size and the surface charge were controlled by adjusting the ratio of hB-Gdn-den to OVA. The NPs were around 200 nm in diameter and stably dispersed, and their encapsulation efficiency for OVA was more than 80%. Although OVA NPs were also prepared using Gdn-den, the NPs aggregated readily. Complexation with hB-Gdn-den induced conformational changes in the OVA. And, the hB peptide promoted digestion of OVA. These suggest that the hB peptide of the Gdn-den works as a possible anchor to OVA. The positively charged OVA NPs effectively associated with RAW264 cells. Thus, the amyloid-promoting Gdn-den, when mixed with OVA at a suitable molar ratio to form NPs, could act as a carrier for delivery of antigen proteins to immune cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c4a","authors":["Chie Kojima"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.bioconjchem.5b00325","first_seen_on":"2015-08-03T17:12:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-4812"],"journal":"Bioconjugate Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1438622059,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.bioconjchem.5b00325"],"pmid":"26186179","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Ovalbumin Delivery by Guanidine-Terminated Dendrimers Bearing an Amyloid-Promoting Peptide via Nanoparticle Formulation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ovalbumin-delivery-guanidineterminated-dendrimers-bearing-amyloidpromoting-peptide-via-nanoparticle"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5436183,"mean":6.3250884403785,"rank":2887926,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1847298,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5436183,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189965,"mean":8.8408878840203,"rank":103524,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":67862,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189965,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":606,"mean":1.9961619834711,"rank":242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":242,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":606,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.4236842105263,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
