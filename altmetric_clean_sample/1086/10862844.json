Similar to patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, including dialysis patients, however, SERMs cannot decrease the risk of hip fracture, which is extremely high in Japanese dialysis patients. One of the most important disadvantages of SERMs is an increase in the risk of venous thromboembolic events and fatal stroke in high-risk groups of the Framingham Stroke Risk Score. On the other hand, SERMs may be used in unique osteoporosis drugs for reducing the incidence and progression of breast cancer. Moreover, SERMs attenuate oxidative stress and may lessen the deterioration of kidney function in patients with chronic kidney disease. The evidences for the efficacy and safety of SERMs in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease are insufficient, and knowledge concerning the selection and indication of osteoporosis drugs for those patients need to be developed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9283cf058f61000dd21","authors":["Nakai, Kentaro"],"doi":"clica160913251332","first_seen_on":"2016-08-27T10:34:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0917-5857"],"issue":"9","journal":"Clinical calcium","last_mentioned_on":1472293650,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27561348?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27561348","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["metabolism"],"title":"[Efficacy and safety of selective estrogen receptor modulators in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease].","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/efficacy-safety-selective-estrogen-receptor-modulators-patients-advanced-chronic-kidney-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8286032,"mean":6.9859461464656,"rank":7165463,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8286032,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252710,"mean":12.415232864678,"rank":212642,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252710,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":137,"mean":0.95551470588235,"rank":78,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":137,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.5,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/769481456649314304","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10862844],"posted_on":"2016-08-27T10:27:30+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":722},"tweet_id":"769481456649314304"}]}}
