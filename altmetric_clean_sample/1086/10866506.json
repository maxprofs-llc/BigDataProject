For this purpose various in silico methods such as RNAseq data and qRT-PCR analysis were used. A total of 24 candidate PvHSP70 gene were identified. Except for chromosome 4 and 7, these candidate PvHSP70 genes were distributed on the remaining chromosomes. While the lowest number of PvHSP70 genes was determined on chromosomes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10 and 11 (one HSP70 gene), the highest number of PvHSP70s was on chromosomes 6 and 8 (seven HSP70 genes each). Three genes; PvHSP70-5, -9, and -10 were found to have no-introns. In addition, four tandemly and six segmentally duplicated gene couples were detected. A total of 13 PvHSP70 genes were targeted by miRNAs of 44 plant species and the most targeted genes were PvHSP70-5 and -23. The expression profile of PvHSP70 genes based on publicly available RNA-seq data was identified and salt treated leaf tissue was found to have more gene expression levels compared to the root. qRT-PCR analysis showed that the transcript concentrations of upregulated PvHSP70 genes in leaves of Zulbiye (sensitive) were mostly higher than those of Yakutiye (resistant). The present study revealed that PvHSP70 genes might play an important role in salt stress response for common bean cultivars and variability between cultivars also suggests that these genes could be used as functional markers for salt tolerance in common bean.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081dd","authors":["B\u00fcy\u00fck, \u0130lker","Inal, Behcet","Ilhan, Emre","Tanriseven, Mehmet","Aras, S\u00fcmer","Erayman, Mustafa"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11033-016-4057-0","first_seen_on":"2016-08-27T16:32:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-4978","0301-4851"],"issue":"11","journal":"Molecular Biology Reports","last_mentioned_on":1472315523,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27558093?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27558093","pubdate":"2016-08-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Animal Anatomy \/ Morphology \/ Histology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Animal Biochemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Genome-wide identification of salinity responsive HSP70s in common bean","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genomewide-identification-salinity-responsive-hsp70s-common-bean"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8286032,"mean":6.9859461464656,"rank":5979434,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2294671,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8286032,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252710,"mean":12.415023137284,"rank":164545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":87940,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252710,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":774,"mean":1.6151849935317,"rank":366,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":407,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":774,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.952380952381,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Ph.
