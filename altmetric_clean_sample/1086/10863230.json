To enhance their specific antitumor activity, we aimed to improve a melanoma cell-based vaccine by transfecting it with 4-1BB ligand, a costimulatory and immune modulatory molecule. Thirty-four American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage IIB-IV patients were vaccinated with a melanoma antigen-rich cell line engineered to express HLA-A2 and 4-1BBL (M20\/A2\/BBL). Twelve serially recruited patients were monitored for interferon \u03b3 expression and CD107a mobilization before and after vaccination. Thirty-three patients remained alive, with an estimated mean overall survival of 26.2 months. No grade 3-4 adverse events were encountered. Immune monitoring detected an increase in circulating antimelanoma CD8 T cells in 9 of 12 patients, which were significantly stimulated by the parental melanoma, reflecting a relevant antitumor response. The results from this study show that the costimulatory 4-1BB ligand fortifies an antigen-rich melanoma cell line with enhanced antigen-specific stimulation of CD8 T cells. The use of a costimulatory molecule as part of a vaccine confers a selective increase of T-cell subsets with antimelanoma reactivity, which in some cases were characterized for their epitope specificity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cc8","authors":["Engelstein, Roni","Merims, Sharon","Eisenberg, Galit","Cohen, Jonathan","Frank, Stephen","Hamburger, Tamar","Frankenburg, Shoshana","Ron, Ilan","Isacson, Ruth","Grenader, Tal","Steinberg, Hanna","Cohen, Cyrille J","Peretz, Tamar","Lotem, Michal","Cohen, Cyrille J."],"doi":"10.1097\/cji.0000000000000138","endpage":"328","first_seen_on":"2016-08-27T11:05:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1537-4513","1524-9557"],"issue":"8","journal":"Journal of Immunotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1473482725,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27564312?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/immunotherapy-journal\/Abstract\/2016\/10000\/Immune_Monitoring_of_Patients_Treated_With_a.5.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/immunotherapy-journal\/2016\/10000\/Immune_Monitoring_of_Patients_Treated_With_a.5.pdf","pmid":"27564312","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["neoplasms","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Immune Monitoring of Patients Treated With a Whole-Cell Melanoma Vaccine Engineered to Express 4-1BBL","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/immunotherapy-journal\/Fulltext\/2016\/10000\/Immune_Monitoring_of_Patients_Treated_With_a.5.aspx","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/immune-monitoring-patients-treated-wholecell-melanoma-vaccine-engineered-express-41bbl"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8355069,"mean":7.046560105308,"rank":6041504,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2014901,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8355069,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253330,"mean":12.418751244429,"rank":164624,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":73848,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253330,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":469,"mean":1.6046495726496,"rank":172,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":280,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":469,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":2.3833333333333,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
