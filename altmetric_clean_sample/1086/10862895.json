These lesions are typically indolent but may rarely have concomitant, synchronous invasive lesions.This report details a 56-year-old black female who presented with a palpable left breast mass. Adenosis with focal fibrous and ductal hyperplasia characteristics were found on core needle biopsy. Excisional biopsy showed EPC with invasive components. A simple mastectomy was performed and a second lesion was identified as invasive ductal carcinoma.EPC typically has good prognosis and a low incidence of invasion. The risk increases in the presence of a second, synchronous lesion as in our case. Management is typically performed with breast conserving methods; however, missing a second lesion is possible. This report provides an overview of the literature and discussion of the role of MRI in preoperative workup.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa7073cf058f61000a516","authors":["Regan, J P","Casaubon, J T","Genelus-Dominique, E"],"doi":"10.1093\/jscr\/rjw141","first_seen_on":"2016-08-27T10:34:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2042-8812"],"issue":"8","journal":"Journal of Surgical Case Reports","last_mentioned_on":1472293750,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27562577?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27562577","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"rjw141","title":"Synchronous invasive ductal carcinoma in encapsulated papillary ductal carcinoma","type":"article","volume":"2016","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synchronous-invasive-ductal-carcinoma-encapsulated-papillary-ductal-carcinoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8286032,"mean":6.9859461464656,"rank":7165446,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8286032,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252711,"mean":12.415179779193,"rank":212639,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252711,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":442,"mean":1.0987437641723,"rank":351,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":442,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.70454545454545,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/769481879191818241","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10862895],"posted_on":"2016-08-27T10:29:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":713},"tweet_id":"769481879191818241"}]}}
