There are no pathognomonic clinical and endoscopic features of this disease and studies on LTB that can assist in its diagnostic characterization are lacking.\nTo identify factors associated with clinical and topographical features of LTB.\na retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted from the medical records of 36 patients with confirmed LTB diagnosis.\nDysphonia and cough were the main symptoms presented by patients and the true vocal folds the most frequently affected site. The average of the duration of the disease evolution was significantly higher in patients with dysphonia than in patients without this symptom. We observed association between dysphonia and true vocal fold lesions and between odynophagia and lesions in the epiglottis, arytenoids and aryepiglottic folds. Odynophagia was more frequent in individuals with lesions in four or more laryngeal sites. Weight loss equal or above 10% of the body weight was more frequent in patients with odynophagia as first symptom and in patients with ulcerated lesion. Dyspnea on exertion was more frequent in individuals with more extensive laryngeal lesions. The percentage of smokers with lesions in four or more laryngeal sites was greater than that found in non-smokers. Laryngeal tissue fragment bacilloscopy and culture examinations were less positive than sputum ones.\nSmoking appears to be associated with the development of more extensive LTB lesions, and LTB with dyspnea on exertion and odynophagia with consequent impairment of nutritional status. We emphasize the need for histopathologic confirmation, once positive sputum bacteriological examinations seem not to necessarily reflect laryngeal involvement.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Reis, Jo\u00e3o Gustavo Corr\u00eaa","Reis, Clarissa Souza Mota","Costa, Daniel C\u00e9sar Silva da","Lucena, M\u00e1rcia Mendon\u00e7a","Schubach, Armando de Oliveira","Oliveira, Raquel de Vasconcellos Carvalhaes","Rolla, Val\u00e9ria Cavalcanti","Concei\u00e7\u00e3o-Silva, F\u00e1tima","Valete-Rosalino, Cl\u00e1udia Maria"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0153450","first_seen_on":"2016-08-27T14:16:21+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"4","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1472307365,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27077734?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27077734","pubdate":"2016-04-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0153450","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Factors Associated with Clinical and Topographical Features of Laryngeal Tuberculosis","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/factors-associated-clinical-topographical-features-laryngeal-tuberculosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8286032,"mean":6.9859461464656,"rank":7165331,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8286032,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252711,"mean":12.415023869257,"rank":212583,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252711,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114688,"mean":10.596321623201,"rank":96729,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114688,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4324,"mean":10.277963913949,"rank":3770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4324,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
