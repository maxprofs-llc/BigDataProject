The lethal effect of NPs depends on their nature, size, shape, and concentration. Present investigation reports that CuO NPs badly affected Brassica nigra seed germination and seedling growth parameters. However, variation in antioxidative activities and nonenzymatic oxidants is observed in plantlets. Culturing the leaf and stem explants on MS medium in presence of low concentration of CuO NPs (1-20\u00a0mg\u00a0l(-1)) produces white thin roots with thick root hairs. These roots also show an increase in DPPH radical scavenging activity (up to 80\u00a0% at 10\u00a0mg\u00a0l(-1)), total antioxidant, and reducing power potential (maximum in presence of 10\u00a0mg\u00a0l(-1) CuO NPs in the media). Nonenzymatic antioxidative molecules, phenolics and flavonoids, are observed elevated but NPs concentration dependent. We can conclude that CuO NPs can induce rooting from plant explants cultured on appropriate medium. These roots can be explored for the production of active chemical constituents.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a88","authors":["Zafar, Hira","Ali, Attarad","Zia, Muhammad"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12010-016-2217-2","first_seen_on":"2016-08-27T10:30:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1559-0291","0273-2289"],"journal":"Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1472292683,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27562818?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27562818","pubdate":"2016-08-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemistry","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology","biochemistry"],"title":"CuO Nanoparticles Inhibited Root Growth from Brassica nigra Seedlings but Induced Root from Stem and Leaf Explants","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cuo-nanoparticles-inhibited-root-growth-brassica-nigra-seedlings-induced-root-stem-leaf-explants"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8286032,"mean":6.9859461464656,"rank":7165497,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8286032,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252710,"mean":12.415256607402,"rank":212651,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252710,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":786,"mean":2.0194624203822,"rank":466,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":786,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":0.98321428571429,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
