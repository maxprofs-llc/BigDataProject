Its aetiopathogenesis is still uncertain. However, trauma has been found to be a contributing factor in a majority of the cases. Clinically, it often presents as an isolated ulcer or an indurated submucosal mass. Microscopically, it is characterized by a diffuse polymorphic cell infiltrate composed predominantly of eosinophils, B and T lymphocytes, macrophages, and large atypical cells involving the superficial mucosa and extending deep into the submucosa causing degeneration of the underlying muscle. TUGSE is rare and may be easily mistaken for a cancer or microbial infection, but it is self-limiting and tends to resolve spontaneously. Thus, awareness of this entity is important to emphasize the correct diagnosis of indurated ulcerated lesions and deliver appropriate and effective treatment. The present case highlights the clinical aspects, aetiopathogenesis and histopathology of this uncommon lesion.","authors":["Bhushan Sharma"],"doi":"10.7860\/jcdr\/2016\/22265.8657","first_seen_on":"2017-06-19T22:04:13+00:00","issns":["2249782X"],"issue":"10","journal":"Journal of clinical and diagnostic research : JCDR","last_mentioned_on":1497921127,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27891480"],"pmcid":"PMC5121818","pmid":"27891480","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Traumatic Ulcerative Granuloma with Stromal Eosinophila: A Case Report and Review of Pathogenesis","type":"article","volume":"10"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2,"IN":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/chioseasi\/statuses\/876923539105906688","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21181229],"posted_on":"2017-06-19T22:03:58+00:00","author":{"name":"Simon Chiosea, MD","url":"http:\/\/path.upmc.edu\/Personnel\/Faculty\/Chiosea.htm","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/692009913531420672\/DnU_R-JI_normal.jpg","description":"Head & Neck and Molecular Pathologist.
