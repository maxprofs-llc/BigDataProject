What is your race pacing strategy?"],"citation":{"abstract":"Pacing is known to influence athletic performance. For the Ironman triathlon program, a positive pacing strategy, i.e., the continuous decrease of speed over time was recommended. By analyzing split times, we assessed the pacing strategies of the top 100 finishers of the cycling part of 13 Ironman races and of the running part of 11 Ironman races taking place in 2014. Furthermore, sex-associated differences in performance and pacing strategies were calculated. We analyzed 7,687 cycling and 11,894 running split times of 1,392 triathletes (1,263 men, 129 women). Changes in speed were assessed using mixedeffects regression analyses. A continuous decrease in speed was observed during cycling in 10\/13 races, and during running in 11\/11 races. In 6\/13 races, women decreased their speed during cycling significantly more than men. The running part showed no significant difference of changes in speed between the sexes. In summary, in the Ironman races evaluated, a positive pacing strategy was adopted in most races. Women were slower than men in 6\/13 cycling races, but there was no difference between men and women in the run splits. Women used the same pacing strategy as men.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9353cf058f61000dec5","authors":["Angehrn, Nicole","R\u00fcst, Christoph A.","Nikolaidis, Pantelis T.","Rosemann, Thomas","Knechtle, Beat"],"first_seen_on":"2017-06-19T21:41:20+00:00","issns":["0304-4920"],"issue":"6","journal":"Chinese journal of physiology","last_mentioned_on":1506746288,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27817192","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27817192\/?utm_content=bufferd9a67&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27817192?dopt=Citation"],"pmid":"27817192","pubdate":"2016-12-31T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Positive pacing in elite IRONMAN triathletes.","type":"article","volume":"59","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/positive-pacing-elite-ironman-triathletes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.6,"score_history":{"1y":3.6,"6m":3.6,"3m":2,"1m":1,"1w":1,"6d":1,"5d":1,"4d":1,"3d":1,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462498,"mean":7.1083922572655,"rank":1997527,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6451208,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462498,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240841,"mean":12.970375303106,"rank":74129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":165939,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240841,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101,"mean":1.98936,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":84,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.625,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
