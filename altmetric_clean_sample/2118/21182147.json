By rotating the whole ARPES measurement system, the photoelectron detection plane can be continuously changed from parallel to normal against the electric field vector of linearly polarized undulator radiation. This polarization tunability enables us to identify the symmetry of the initial electronic states with respect to the mirror planes, and to selectively observe the electronic states based on the dipole selection rule in the photoemission process. Specifications of the rotatable high-resolution ARPES system are described, as well as its capabilities with some representative experimental results.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f4b","authors":["Iwasawa, H.","Shimada, K.","Schwier, E.F.","Zheng, M.","Kojima, Y.","Hayashi, H.","Jiang, J.","Higashiguchi, M.","Aiura, Y.","Namatame, H.","Taniguchi, M.","Iwasawa, H.","Shimada, K.","Schwier, E.F.","Zheng, M.","Kojima, Y.","Hayashi, H.","Jiang, J.","Higashiguchi, M.","Aiura, Y.","Namatame, H.","Taniguchi, M.","IUCr"],"doi":"10.1107\/s1600577517008037","first_seen_on":"2017-06-20T00:00:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1600-5775"],"issue":"Pt 4","journal":"Journal of Synchrotron Radiation (International Union of Crystallography - IUCr)","last_mentioned_on":1497916803,"links":["http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?S1600577517008037"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.iucr.org\/s\/issues\/2017\/04\/00\/rx5035\/rx5035.pdf","pmid":"28664891","pubdate":"2017-06-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"International Union of Crystallography","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Optical Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
