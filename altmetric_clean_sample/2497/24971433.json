The use of population genetic approaches provides novel insights into how natural selection imposed by pathogen pressures, in its different forms and intensities, has shaped the patterns of diversity of the human genome at the population level. These studies help to distinguish genes playing essential, non-redundant functions in host defence from genes variation in which has conferred selective advantages to specific human populations and\/or has been acquired through admixture with archaic hominins, such as Neandertals. However, with the improvements in hygiene and the advent of antibiotics and vaccination, pressures imposed by pathogens have recently been relaxed. Accumulating evidence suggests that alleles having conferred an advantage against infection in the past may nowadays be associated with increased risk to develop immune-related disorders, such as autoimmunity and inflammation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f610008119","authors":["Matthieu Deschamps","Llu\u00eds Quintana-Murci"],"doi":"10.1051\/medsci\/20163212011","first_seen_on":"2017-09-08T17:18:44+00:00","issns":["0767-0974","1958-5381"],"issue":"12","journal":"M\u00e9decine\/Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1504891113,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28044971?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28044971","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Immunit\u00e9 inn\u00e9e et maladies chez l\u2019homme","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/immunit-inne-et-maladies-chez-lhomme"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8386234,"mean":7.0650459988331,"rank":7249290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8386234,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123545,"mean":11.934613546591,"rank":100579,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123545,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":396,"mean":1.7957316455696,"rank":295,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":396,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/myEvolPapers\/statuses\/906205127001776128","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24971433],"posted_on":"2017-09-08T17:18:33+00:00","author":{"name":"myEvolutionPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/773888522528972802\/CS8c6a4O_normal.jpg","description":"A little robot tweeting papers that probably reflect the interests of its creator, @ajhelmstetter - pop gen, phylo & evolution","id_on_source":"myEvolPapers","tweeter_id":"773825419372064768","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":27},"tweet_id":"906205127001776128"}]}}
