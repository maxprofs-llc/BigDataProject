Such personnel have played key roles in developing public health. Over the years, however, the missions of the schools of public health have become blurred. To a significant degree, a focus on health care has displaced public health as schools have followed the money trail. Often research takes precedence over teaching, so that, ironically, research findings are not disseminated to those who will practice public health. Educating personnel for practitioner leadership roles in environmental health and protection is inadequate. These and other trends have serious, long-term ramifications for public health practice. This article offers suggestions for improving the situation, including making use of practitioners in schools of public health, encouraging partnerships between practitioners and academics for research and funding support, developing paid student practica, developing a market for MPH graduates, and changing the accreditation requirements of the Council on Education for Public Health.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ef0","authors":["Gordon, L J","McFarlane, D R"],"first_seen_on":"2017-09-08T17:51:55+00:00","issns":["0197-5897"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Public Health Policy","last_mentioned_on":1504893101,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8919960"],"pmid":"8919960","pubdate":"1996-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Policy And Administration","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Public health practitioner incubation plight: following the money trail.","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/public-health-practitioner-incubation-plight-following-money-trail"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8386234,"mean":7.0650459988331,"rank":4476041,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2334034,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8386234,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123545,"mean":11.93460464288,"rank":66736,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":44296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123545,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":454,"mean":7.9923973509934,"rank":377,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":59,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":454,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":2.6666666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Social Sciences":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Business, Management and Accounting":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/KeishawnAnderso\/statuses\/906213465898991616","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24972429],"posted_on":"2017-09-08T17:51:41+00:00","author":{"name":"Keishawn L.
