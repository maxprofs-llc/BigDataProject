ExT protocol was performed on treadmill for a period of 8 weeks (60m\/days, 5\u00d7\/week, 16m\/min), which started 6 weeks after MI. Cardiac hemodynamic evaluations of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and morphometric cardiac were used to characterize HF. The hemodynamic variables were recorded and gastrocnemius muscle was collected. TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-10 protein levels were determined by multiplex bead array.\nSed-HF group presented increase of TNF-\u03b1 level when compared with the Sed-Sham group (mean difference, MD 1.3; 95% confidence interval, CI -0.04 to 2.5). ExT reduced by 59% TNF-\u03b1 level in Tr-HF group (MD -1.7; 95% CI -2.9 to -0.3) and increased IL-10 (MD 15; 95% CI 11-26) when compared with the Sed-HF group. Thus, the gastrocnemius muscle IL-10\/TNF-\u03b1 ratio was increased in Tr-HF rats (MD 15; 95% CI -8 to 47) when compared with the Sed-HF rats.\nThese results demonstrate that ExT not only attenuates TNF-\u03b1 level but also improves the IL-10 cytokine level in skeletal muscle of HF rats.","altmetric_jid":"56a768e22a83eeb12a8b4a79","authors":["Leonardo Calegari","Ramiro B.
