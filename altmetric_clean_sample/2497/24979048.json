In vitro studies demonstrate Ct growth inhibition occurs by interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3)-mediated depletion of intracellular tryptophan, and some Ct strains utilize extracellular indole to restore tryptophan levels. Whether tryptophan levels are associated with Ct infection in clearance humans remains unknown. We evaluated tryptophan, indole, and IFN-\u03b3 levels in cervicovaginal lavages from women with either naturally cleared Ct infection or persisting Ct infection. Women who cleared infection had significantly lower tryptophan levels and trended towards lower IFN-\u03b3 levels compared to women with persisting infection. Due to its volatility, indole was not measurable in either group.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002df6","authors":["Stephen J. Jordan","Kristin M. Olson","Stephen Barnes","Landon S.
