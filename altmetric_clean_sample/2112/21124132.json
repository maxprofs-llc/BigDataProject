Sequence data and comparison of the transcriptome of this cell line to eutherian mammal PTs would further broaden the utility of this culture model. However, genomic sequence for Didelphis virginiana is not available and although a draft genome sequence for the opossum Monodelphis domestica (sequenced in 2012 by the Broad Institute) exists, transcripts sequenced from both species show significant divergence. The Monodelphis domestica sequence is not highly annotated and the majority of transcripts are predicted rather than experimentally validated. Using deep RNA sequencing of the Didelphis virginiana OK cell line we characterized its transcriptome via de novo transcriptome assembly and alignment to the Monodelphis domestica genome. The quality of the de novo assembled transcriptome was assessed by the extent of homology to sequences in nucleotide and protein databases. Gene expression levels in the OK cell line, from both the de novo transcriptome and genes aligned to the Monodelphis domestica genome, were compared to publicly available rat kidney nephron segment expression data. Our studies demonstrate the expression in OK cells of numerous PT specific ion transporters and other key proteins relevant for rodent and human PT function. Additionally, the sequence and expression data reported here provide an important resource for genetic manipulation and other studies on PT cell function using these cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002213","authors":["Eshbach, Megan L.","Sethi, Rahil","Avula, Raghunandan","Lamb, Janette","Hollingshead, Deborah J.","Finegold, David N.","Locker, Joseph","Chandran, Uma R.","Weisz, Ora A","Megan L.
