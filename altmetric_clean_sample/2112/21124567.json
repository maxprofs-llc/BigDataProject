However, HIV infection is still an ailment which is spreading throughout the world extensively. Given the confinements of the present restorative methodologies\u00a0and the non-availability of any strategic vaccination against HIV, there is a squeezing need to build a therapeutic treatment. Viral tropism for HIV includes CD4+ cells, macrophages, and microglial cells, and it is through binding with co-receptors C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) and C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4). While these cell types are present in all individuals, there are rare cases that stayed uninfected even after getting exposed to an overwhelming load of HIV. Research revealed a homozygous 32-base pair deletion (\u039432\/\u039432) in CCR5. After careful consideration, a hypothesis was proposed a\u00a0few years back that a cure for HIV disease is possible, through hematopoietic stem cells transplantation from a donor homozygous for the CCR5-\u039432 deletion. Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) based quality treatment may serve as a promising tool as these perpetual, self-renewing progenitor cells could be modified to oppose HIV infection. If done properly, the changed HSCs would offer the\u00a0permanent creation of genetically modified cells that are resistant to HIV infection and\/or have improved hostility to viral action which will eventually clear the contaminated cells. The purpose of this review is to concentrate on two facets of HSC genetic treatment for potentially life-threatening HIV infection: building HIV-resistant cells and designing cells that can target HIV disease. These two strategic approaches can be the frontline of a quality treatment plan against HIV infection and, as an\u00a0individual treatment or a combination thereof, has been proposed to possibly destroy HIV altogether.","authors":["Varshil Mehta","Divya Chandramohan","Shivika Agarwal"],"doi":"10.7759\/cureus.1093","first_seen_on":"2017-06-16T16:31:37+00:00","issns":["2168-8184"],"issue":"3","journal":"Cureus","last_mentioned_on":1504808822,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5391252\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.7759\/cureus.1093"],"pmcid":"PMC5391252","pmid":"28413739","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cureus Inc.","title":"Genetic Modulation Therapy Through Stem Cell Transplantation for Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 Infection","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genetic-modulation-therapy-through-stem-cell-transplantation-human-immunodeficiency-virus-1-infectio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.35,"score_history":{"1y":4.35,"6m":4.35,"3m":3,"1m":3,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.35},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Ph.
