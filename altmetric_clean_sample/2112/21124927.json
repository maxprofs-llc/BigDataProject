Longitudinal results on a subsample of full-time, older workers (n=1,642) from the Maastricht Cohort Study suggest that over 4 years of follow-up personal resources like personal mastery and perceived health related to less (prolonged) fatigue and more work enjoyment. Personal mastery also related to later retirement intentions. A work-related resource like decision authority related to less prolonged fatigue. (Prolonged) fatigue related to earlier retirement intentions, suggesting that fatigue may be a pathway to early retirement. Finally, little evidence was found for effect modification by resources. This prospective study indicates that work-related and personal resources may be useful for prolonging working careers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d73cf058f610001232","authors":["Dave Stynen","Nicole W.H.
