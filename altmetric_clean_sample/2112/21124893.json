Indeed, we have recently discovered that nanoparticles made of the squalene derivative of the anticancer agent gemcitabine (SQGem) strongly interacted with the LDLs in the human blood. In the present study, we showed both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo that such interaction led to the preferential accumulation of SQGem in cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) with high LDL receptor expression. As a result, an improved pharmacological activity has been observed in MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice, an experimental model with a low sensitivity to gemcitabine. Accordingly, we proved that the use of squalene moieties not only induced the gemcitabine insertion into lipoproteins, but that it could also be exploited to indirectly target cancer cells in\u00a0vivo.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5083cf058f61000311d","authors":["Dunja Sobot","Simona Mura","Marie Rouquette","Branko Vukosavljevic","Fanny Cayre","Eric Buchy","Gr\u00e9gory Pieters","S\u00e9bastien Garcia-Argote","Maike Windbergs","Didier Desma\u00eble","Patrick Couvreur"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ymthe.2017.05.016","first_seen_on":"2017-06-16T16:47:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["15250016"],"journal":"Molecular Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1497677134,"links":["http:\/\/www.cell.com\/molecular-therapy-family\/molecular-therapy\/fulltext\/S1525-0016(17)30234-4"],"pmid":"28606375","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Circulating Lipoproteins: A Trojan Horse Guiding Squalenoylated Drugs to LDL-Accumulating Cancer Cells","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/circulating-lipoproteins-trojan-horse-guiding-squalenoylated-drugs-ldlaccumulating-cancer-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.55,"score_history":{"1y":3.55,"6m":3.55,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8386076,"mean":7.0651873001299,"rank":1987024,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6389043,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8386076,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":220007,"mean":13.147269156295,"rank":68526,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":151032,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":220007,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1296,"mean":10.22825019305,"rank":572,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":723,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1296,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":10.475538461538,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MuraSimona\/statuses\/875756630717194240","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21124893],"posted_on":"2017-06-16T16:47:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Simona Mura","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/863807886077677568\/ucU-r5uP_normal.jpg","description":"Associate professor @ UMR CNRS 8612 crossing barriers with #nanomedicine and building #3Dmodels runner and pastry chef in the spare time","id_on_source":"MuraSimona","tweeter_id":"1065990902","geo":{"lt":48.85341,"ln":2.3488,"country":"FR"},"followers":535},"tweet_id":"875756630717194240"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/umr8612\/statuses\/875764283749085185","license":"gnip","rt":["MuraSimona"],"citation_ids":[21124893],"posted_on":"2017-06-16T17:17:30+00:00","author":{"name":"Institut Galien PSud","url":"http:\/\/www.umr-cnrs8612.u-psud.fr\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/433517632231206913\/YxNhLzxQ_normal.jpeg","description":"The Galien Paris-Sud Institute (headed by @Elias_Fattal) creates innovative drug delivery systems and nanomedicines.","id_on_source":"umr8612","tweeter_id":"2339961668","geo":{"lt":48.76507,"ln":2.26655,"country":"FR"},"followers":241},"tweet_id":"875764283749085185"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BorisVauzeilles\/statuses\/875854508320018432","license":"gnip","rt":["MuraSimona"],"citation_ids":[21124893],"posted_on":"2017-06-16T23:16:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Boris Vauzeilles","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/772088305890525185\/LXGwIjFl_normal.jpg","description":"synthetic chemist -
