Here we report on a combined study of design, fabrication and optoelectronic properties of infrared photodetectors comprising 4 million n+-i-n+ InP nanowires periodically ordered in arrays. The nanowires were grown by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy on InP substrates, with either a single or 20 InAsP quantum discs embedded in the i-segment. By Zn compensation of the residual n-dopants in the i-segment, the room-temperature dark current is strongly suppressed to a level of pA\/NW at 1 V bias. The low dark current is manifested in the spectrally resolved photocurrent measurements, which reveal strong photocurrent contributions from the InAsP quantum discs at room temperature with a threshold wavelength of about 2.0 u\uf06dm and a bias-tunable responsivity reaching 7 A\/W@1.38 u\uf06dm at 2 V bias. Two different processing schemes were implemented to study the effects of radial self-gating in the nanowires induced by the nanowire\/SiOx\/ITO wrap-gate geometry. Summarized, our results show that properly designed axial InP\/InAsP nanowire heterostructures are promising candidates for broadband photodetectors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003145","authors":["Mohammad Karimi","Vishal Jain","Magnus Heurlin","Ali Nowzari","Laiq Hussain","David Lindgren","Jan Eric Stehr","Irina A.
