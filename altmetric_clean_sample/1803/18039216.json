Studies suggest higher urinary bisphenol A (BPA) concentrations are associated with diabetes in non-pregnant populations, but the association between BPA and glucose levels among pregnant women is unclear.\nTo assess trimester-specific urinary BPA concentrations in relation to blood glucose levels among subfertile women.\nEnvironment and Reproductive Health Study, an ongoing prospective cohort study.\nA fertility center in a teaching hospital.\nA total of 245 women contributed at least one urine sample during 1st and\/or 2nd trimesters, delivered a singleton or twin pregnancy, and had available blood glucose data (2005-2015).\nBlood glucose levels after a non-fasting 50-gram glucose challenge test at 24-28 weeks of gestation.\nThe specific gravity-adjusted geometric mean urinary BPA concentrations during 1st and 2nd trimesters were 1.39 and 1.27 \u00b5g\/L, respectively. Second trimester BPA concentrations were positively associated with blood glucose (P, trend=0.01). Specifically, the adjusted mean glucose levels (95%CI) for women in the highest quartile of 2nd trimester BPA concentrations was 119 (112, 126) mg\/dL compared to 106 (100, 112) mg\/dL for women in the lowest quartile. No associations were observed between 1st trimester BPA concentrations and blood glucose levels.\nBPA exposure during 2nd trimester may have adverse effect on blood glucose levels among subfertile women. As the findings represent the first report suggesting a potential etiologically relevant window for BPA and glucose in humans, further studies are needed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be1","authors":["Chiu, Yu-Han","M\u00ednguez-Alarc\u00f3n, Lidia","Ford, Jennifer B","Keller, Myra","Seely, Ellen W","Messerlian, Carmen","Petrozza, John","Williams, Paige L","Ye, Xiaoyun","Calafat, Antonia M","Hauser, Russ","James-Todd, Tamarra",", ","Ford, Jennifer B.","Seely, Ellen W.","Williams, Paige L.","Calafat, Antonia M."],"doi":"10.1210\/jc.2017-00022","first_seen_on":"2017-03-23T15:25:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1945-7197","0021-972X"],"journal":"The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1502358523,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28323984","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jcem\/article\/102\/4\/1350\/2896751\/Trimester-Specific-Urinary-Bisphenol-A#.WYwr43PM9lw.twitter"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jcem\/article-pdf\/102\/4\/1350\/11205897\/jc.2017-00022.pdf","pmid":"28323984","pubdate":"2017-03-23T22:12:52+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","endocrinology"],"title":"Trimester-specific urinary bisphenol A concentrations and blood glucose levels among pregnant women from a fertility clinic.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/trimesterspecific-urinary-bisphenol-concentrations-blood-glucose-levels-among-pregnant-women-fertili"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8352366,"mean":7.0446264010179,"rank":6039379,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2014392,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8352366,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":247492,"mean":13.316068543906,"rank":163707,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":69390,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":247492,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7004,"mean":8.5709855776096,"rank":5637,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":1193,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7004,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97,"mean":30.241645833333,"rank":76,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Unspecified":2,"Environmental Science":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/sarhoward\/statuses\/844933111381213184","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18039216],"posted_on":"2017-03-23T15:25:26+00:00","author":{"name":"Sarah Howard","url":"http:\/\/www.DiabetesAndEnvironment.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/672811561770205184\/t9uA4V1M_normal.jpg","description":"Type 1 diabetes (me & son), openAPS, http:\/\/www.DiabetesAndEnvironment.org, coordinate diabetes\/obesity group for Collab. on Health & Environment, tweets my own","id_on_source":"sarhoward","tweeter_id":"815300402","geo":{"lt":42.65258,"ln":-73.75623,"country":"US"},"followers":896},"tweet_id":"844933111381213184"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/GrumpybaldProf\/statuses\/895582675016105985","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18039216],"posted_on":"2017-08-10T09:48:43+00:00","author":{"name":"Paul Fowler","url":"http:\/\/www.abdn.ac.uk\/ims\/profiles\/p.a.fowler","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/755885925813456897\/slanRNEu_normal.jpg","description":"I have been committing acts of reproductive research for so long I may be starting to get the hang of it.
