It is associated with a wide variety of clinical conditions and diagnoses. In addition to its prevalence, it is closely associated with mortality, and the risk of death seems to increase as the number of failing organs increases. Thus, preventing the progression or development of organ failure holds promise as a method to improve outcomes for a wide range of critically ill children. However, despite being first described 4 decades ago, much remains to be learned about this syndrome including its triggering events, pathophysiology, and genetic predispositions. In addition, a better understanding of the influence of age and development on its occurrence and severity is needed as neonates and infants seem to be differentially afflicted. In an attempt to begin to address these issues, the Pediatric Trauma and Critical Illness Branch of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development convened experts in the field at a 2-day workshop to discuss this syndrome, identify key knowledge gaps, and consider potential opportunities for future research.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008484","authors":["Tamburro, Robert F.","Jenkins, Tammara L."],"doi":"10.1097\/pcc.0000000000001044","first_seen_on":"2017-03-23T15:45:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1529-7535"],"issue":"3_suppl","journal":"Pediatric Critical Care Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1490318147,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/pccmjournal\/Abstract\/2017\/03001\/Multiple_Organ_Dysfunction_Syndrome___A_Challenge.1.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/pccmjournal\/2017\/03001\/Multiple_Organ_Dysfunction_Syndrome___A_Challenge.1.pdf","pmid":"28248828","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"S1","subjects":["criticalcare","pediatrics"],"title":"Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/pccmjournal\/Fulltext\/2017\/03001\/Multiple_Organ_Dysfunction_Syndrome___A_Challenge.1.aspx","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multiple-organ-dysfunction-syndrome-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":3656271,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4632390,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248685,"mean":13.34562927249,"rank":105980,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":138560,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248685,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2123,"mean":2.5216908576814,"rank":632,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":1460,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2123,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98,"mean":7.4567010309278,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":3,"BR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PedCritCareMed\/statuses\/844938078242439168","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18039626],"posted_on":"2017-03-23T15:45:10+00:00","author":{"name":"PCCM","url":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/pccmjournal\/pages\/default.aspx","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000851598361\/37fe116807faf804d7b38b36804903df_normal.jpeg","description":"\"Pediatric Critical Care Medicine\" is written for the entire multidisciplinary team.
