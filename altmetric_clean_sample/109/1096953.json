Identifying molecules that are upregulated in STIC is important not only to provide biomarkers to assist in the diagnosis of STIC but also to elucidate our understanding of the pathogenesis of HGSC. In this study, we performed RNA sequencing to compare transcriptomes between HGSC and normal fallopian tube epithelium (FTE), and we identified LAMC1 encoding laminin \u03b31 as one of the preferentially upregulated genes associated with HGSC. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction further validated LAMC1 upregulation in HGSC as compared with normal FTE. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on 32 cases of concurrent HGSC and STIC. The latter was diagnosed on the basis of morphology, TP53 mutations, and p53 and Ki-67 immunohistochemical patterns. Laminin \u03b31 immunostaining intensity was found to be significantly higher in STIC and HGSC compared with adjacent FTE in all cases (P<0.001). In normal FTE, laminin \u03b31 immunoreactivity was predominantly localized in the basement membrane or on the apical surface of ciliated cells, whereas in STIC and HGSC cells, laminin \u03b31 staining was diffuse and intense throughout the cytoplasm. More importantly, strong laminin \u03b31 staining was detected in all 13 STICs, which lacked p53 immunoreactivity because of null mutations. These findings suggest that the overexpression of laminin \u03b31 immunoreactivity and alteration of its staining pattern in STICs can serve as a useful tissue biomarker, especially for those STICs that are negative for p53 and have a low Ki-67 labeling index.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f61000698e","authors":["Kuhn E","Kurman RJ","Soslow RA","Han G","Sehdev AS","Morin PJ","Wang TL","Shih IM"],"doi":"10.1097\/pas.0b013e31825ec07a","endpage":"1834","first_seen_on":"2012-11-29T18:47:55+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["0147-5185"],"issue":"12","journal":"The American Journal of Surgical Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1354214867,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/ajsp\/Abstract\/2012\/12000\/The_Diagnostic_and_Biological_Implications_of.10.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/ajsp\/2012\/12000\/The_Diagnostic_and_Biological_Implications_of.10.pdf","pmid":"22892598","pubdate":"2012-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1826","subjects":["pathology","generalsurgery"],"title":"The Diagnostic and Biological Implications of Laminin Expression in Serous Tubal Intraepithelial Carcinoma","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diagnostic-biological-implications-laminin-expression-serous-tubal-intraepithelial-carcinoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3619417,"mean":4.9286052998637,"rank":2903892,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":71667,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3619417,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275671,"mean":5.6780949033266,"rank":220236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":299,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275671,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":990,"mean":2.3916016177958,"rank":873,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":990,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":1.3435483870968,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
