In recent years this tree hole breeding mosquito species appears to have exploited novel breeding sites, including large and organically rich man-made containers, with consequently larger mosquito populations in close vicinity to humans. This lead to investigate whether current populations of An. plumbeus would be able to efficiently transmit Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for the most deadly form of malaria.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000086b","doi":"10.1186\/1475-2875-11-393","first_seen_on":"2012-11-27T13:46:11+00:00","issns":["1475-2875"],"issue":"1","journal":"Malaria Journal","last_mentioned_on":1354530783,"links":["http:\/\/www.malariajournal.com\/content\/11\/1\/393\/abstract"],"pmid":"23181931","pubdate":"2012-11-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Parasitology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Tropical Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"393","title":"Anopheles plumbeus (Diptera: Culicidae) in Europe: a mere nuisance mosquito or potential malaria vector?","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/anopheles-plumbeus-diptera-culicidae-europe-mere-nuisance-mosquito-potential-malaria-vector"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":1785536,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2640084,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280263,"mean":5.8691377710855,"rank":96781,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":177459,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280263,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1707,"mean":3.6280867526378,"rank":788,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":886,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1707,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86,"mean":2.87,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
