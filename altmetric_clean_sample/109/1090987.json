Functionally, exercise tolerance is poor for people with COPD and is linked to difficulty in performing daily tasks. More specifically, exercise difficulties are due partly to dyspnoea and lower limb skeletal muscle dysfunction. The benefit of exercise that does not exacerbate the disease while improving exercise tolerance is salient. Whole-body vibration (WBV) is a mode of physical activity known to improve muscular function of the lower limbs, yet efficacy has not been investigated for a WBV intervention conducted in a home-based setting for people with COPD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d9","authors":["Furness T","Bate N","Welsh L","Naughton G","Lorenzen C"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2466-12-71","first_seen_on":"2012-11-27T01:58:03+00:00","issns":["1471-2466",""],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Pulmonary Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1479850985,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2466\/12\/71\/abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23181339"],"pmid":"23181339","pubdate":"2012-11-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pneumology\/Respiratory System","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"71","subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Efficacy of a whole-body vibration intervention to effect exercise tolerance and functional performance of the lower limbs of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/efficacy-wholebody-vibration-intervention-effect-exercise-tolerance-functional-performance-lower-lim-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7724913,"mean":6.6254088328702,"rank":3232094,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4381223,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7724913,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":290747,"mean":6.5350376823756,"rank":106374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":178770,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":290747,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":617,"mean":3.3165292207792,"rank":213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":386,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":617,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":6.65,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
