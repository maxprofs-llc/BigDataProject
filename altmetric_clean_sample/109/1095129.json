The results support the idea that each of the four mechanoreceptive afferent systems innervating the hand serves a distinctly different perceptual function, and that tactile perception can be understood as the sum of these functions. Furthermore, the receptors in each of those systems seem to be specialized for their assigned perceptual function.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a6","authors":["Johnson, K O"],"first_seen_on":"2012-11-29T00:48:45+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0959-4388"],"issue":"4","journal":"Current Opinion in Neurobiology","last_mentioned_on":1354152743,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11502392"],"pmid":"11502392","pubdate":"2001-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["biology","neurology"],"title":"The roles and functions of cutaneous mechanoreceptors.","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/roles-functions-cutaneous-mechanoreceptors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":2086816,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":2384614,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280199,"mean":5.8606415320595,"rank":122503,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":154498,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280199,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":776,"mean":3.3766116129032,"rank":463,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":311,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":776,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":5.28016,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":6,"Professor > Associate Professor":27,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":22,"Researcher":82,"Student  > Ph.
