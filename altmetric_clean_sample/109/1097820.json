The Cd(II) atom is coordinated by the four pyrrole N atoms of the 5,10,15,20-tetra-phenyl-porphyrinate ligand and one N atom of the axial azide ligand in a square-pyramidal geometry. The azide group is also linked to the Na(I) atom, which is surrounded by one 18-crown-6 molecule and additionally bonded to a second 18-crown-6 molecule trans to the azide group. The porphyrin core exhibits a major doming distortion (\u223c40%) and the crystal structure is stabilized by weak C-H\u22ef\u03c0 inter-actions. The mol-ecular structure features weak intra-molecular hydrogen bonds: two O-H\u22efO inter-actions within the 18-crown-6 mol-ecule and one C-H(18-crown-6)\u22efN(azido) contact.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037ea","authors":["Nasri, H."],"doi":"10.1107\/s1600536812048052","first_seen_on":"2012-11-30T03:49:22+00:00","issns":["1600-5368"],"journal":"Acta Crystallographica: Section E (International Union of Crystallography - IUCr)","last_mentioned_on":1354246631,"links":["http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?ng5303&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.iucr.org\/e\/issues\/2012\/12\/00\/ng5303\/ng5303.pdf","pmid":"23468761","publisher":"International Union of Crystallography","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Di-\u00ce\u00bc-azido-bis\u00c2\u00ad(\u00ce\u00bc-1,4,7,10,13,16-hexa\u00c2\u00adoxacyclo\u00c2\u00adocta\u00c2\u00addeca\u00c2\u00adne)bis\u00c2\u00ad(5,10,15,20-tetra\u00c2\u00adphenyl\u00c2\u00adporphyrinato)dicadmium\u00c2\u00addisodium","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diazidobis147101316hexaoxacyclooctadecanebis51015-20tetraphenylporphyrinatodicadmiumdisodium"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":3080696,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":961609,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280183,"mean":5.8641118558652,"rank":191575,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":55435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280183,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1462,"mean":0.6040205338809,"rank":434,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":895,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1462,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":0.86842105263158,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/IUCr\/status\/274356375260393473","license":"public","citation_ids":[1097820],"posted_on":"2012-11-30T03:37:11+00:00","author":{"name":"IUCr","url":"http:\/\/www.iucr.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/586153889533145088\/vS5Kc1h5_normal.jpg","description":"Publications and activities of the International Union of Crystallography","id_on_source":"IUCr","tweeter_id":"84666459","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1762},"tweet_id":"274356375260393473"}]}}
