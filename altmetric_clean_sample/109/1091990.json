Conventional treatment methods are unsatisfactory, leading to a pattern of regression and remission, and ultimately failure. This pattern suggests that one of the possible strategies for improving outcomes is continuous therapy to maintain suppression of the surviving tumor cells. Optimal management of MM requires potent agents and modalities with direct tumoricidal activity, which can also provide continuous suppression of the residual tumor to prevent disease relapse. Immunomodulatory agents exert immunomodulatory and tumoricidal effects, and cause disruption of stromal cell support from the bone marrow microenvironment. Therefore continuous therapy with immunomodulatory agents may be able to provide both tumor reduction and tumor suppression, enabling physicians to consider the possibility of incorporating continuous therapy into the treatment paradigm of patients with MM.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4fa3cf058f610003009","authors":["Borrello, Ivan","Borrello I"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0145-2126(12)70003-6","endpage":"S12","first_seen_on":"2012-11-27T15:47:26+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["0145-2126","01452126"],"journal":"Leukemia Research","last_mentioned_on":1354031238,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0145212612700036"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.lrjournal.com\/article\/S0145-2126(12)70003-6\/pdf","pmid":"23176722","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"S3","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Can we change the disease biology of multiple myeloma?","type":"article","volume":"36 Suppl 1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/we-change-disease-biology-multiple-myeloma-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6561414,"mean":6.0795715041865,"rank":4853812,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":963976,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6561414,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":286902,"mean":6.3587856647418,"rank":190868,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":49417,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":286902,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":526,"mean":1.5548114285714,"rank":314,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":126,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":526,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.78888888888889,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
