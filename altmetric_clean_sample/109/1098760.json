SO-MUM was used to back-calculate emissions from spatially resolved measured air concentrations of PCBs and PBDEs in Toronto, Canada. Estimated emissions of \u03a3(88)PCBs were 230 (40-480) kg y(-1), 280 (50-580) g y(-1) km(-2), or 90 (16-190) mg y(-1) capita(-1), and \u03a3(26)PBDEs were 28 (6-63) kg y(-1), 34 (7-77) g y(-1) km(-2), or 11 (2-25) mg y(-1) capita(-1). A mass inventory of penta- and octa-BDEs in Toronto was estimated to be 200 tonnes (90-1000 tonnes) or 80 (40-400) g capita(-1). Using this estimate and that of 440 (280-800) tonnes of PCBs, estimated emissions of \u03a3(88)PCBs and \u03a3(26)PBDEs per mass of chemical inventory in Toronto were 0.5 (0.05-1.6) and 0.1 (0.01-0.7) g y(-1) kg(-1), respectively. The results suggest annual emission rates of 0.04% and 0.01% from the mass inventories with downtown accounting for 30% and 16% of Toronto's chemical inventory and emissions of PCBs and PBDEs, respectively. Since total PBDE emissions are a function of mass inventory, which is proportional to building volume, we conclude that building volume can be used as a proxy to predict emissions. Per mass inventory emission rates were negatively related to vapor pressure within a compound class, but not consistently when considering all compound congeners.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027ef","doi":"10.1021\/es3033023","first_seen_on":"2012-11-30T15:14:08+00:00","issns":["1520-5851"],"journal":"Environmental Science & Technology","last_mentioned_on":1354511725,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23190380"],"pmid":"23190380","pubdate":"2012-11-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"SO-MUM: A coupled atmospheric transport and multimedia model used to predict intra-urban scale PCB and PBDE emissions and fate.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/somum-coupled-atmospheric-transport-multimedia-model-used-predict-intraurbanscale-pcb-pbde-emissions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2124291,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2228953,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280185,"mean":5.8744999643091,"rank":125551,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":142155,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280185,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4705,"mean":8.4227104591837,"rank":2663,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":1906,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4705,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145,"mean":8.4004305555556,"rank":86,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
