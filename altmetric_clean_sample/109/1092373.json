Due to its specific prerequisite conditions, DCI is rare in comparison with other illnesses and most physicians are inexperienced in treatment. In a fishery area in northern China, during the past decade, tens of thousands of divers engaged in seafood harvesting and thousands suffered from DCI. We established a hyperbaric facility there and treated the majority of the cases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Wenbing Xu","Wenwu Liu","Guoyang Huang","ZiJiao Zou","Zhiyu Cai","Weigang Xu"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0050079","first_seen_on":"2012-11-27T18:45:11+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"11","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1399012466,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0050079","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23185538"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0050079.pdf","pmid":"23185538","pubdate":"2012-11-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e50079","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Decompression Illness: Clinical Aspects of 5278 Consecutive Cases Treated in a Single Hyperbaric Unit","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/decompression-illness-clinical-aspects-5278-consecutive-cases-treated-single-hyperbaric-unit"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3712057,"mean":4.9755837164128,"rank":842720,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2345263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3712057,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":276162,"mean":5.6692982716607,"rank":72733,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":199493,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":276162,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65457,"mean":8.3074083048154,"rank":19438,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":44665,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65457,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6386,"mean":6.0424999216915,"rank":1559,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":4776,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6386,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":11,"Social Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Priority1Medica\/statuses\/273497622357090304","license":"public","citation_ids":[1092373],"posted_on":"2012-11-27T18:44:49+00:00","author":{"name":"Priority 1 Medical","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_5_normal.png","description":"","id_on_source":"Priority1Medica","tweeter_id":"80361237","followers":189},"tweet_id":"273497622357090304"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/Priority1Medica\/status\/273497625112756225","citation_ids":[1092373],"posted_on":"2012-11-27T18:44:49+00:00","author":{"name":"Priority 1 Medical","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_5_normal.png","description":"","id_on_source":"Priority1Medica","tweeter_id":"80361237","followers":189},"tweet_id":"273497625112756225"}],"googleplus":[{"title":"Decompression illness: clinical aspects of 5278 consecutive cases treated in a single hyperbaric unit...","url":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/106621035212768576619\/posts\/YspaDaX7wwg","citation_ids":[1092373],"posted_on":"2014-04-30T08:12:19+00:00","summary":"Decompression illness: clinical aspects of 5278 consecutive cases treated in a single hyperbaric unit...
