Although structural data are commonly used for the estimation of bond lengths and further delimitation of the true coordination number (e.g., octahedral: 6 versus 5 + 1 versus 4 + 2), we show here for the first time by solid-state NMR a more accurate appreciation of the V-O bonding scheme in this complex oxide which appears well adapted to the full series of vanado-phosphate materials. The direct characterization of V-O-P bridges through the J-mediated correlation (51)V{(31)P} heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (J-HMQC) technique allows a contrasted hierarchy of the V-O electronic delocalization and indirectly supports the presence or not of the V-O bond. In the reported lead vanado-phosphate structure, the two vanadium polyhedra that have been assigned to octahedra from a bond length point of view have been finally reclassified as tetra- and penta-coordinated units on the basis of the solid-state NMR results. More generally, we believe that the improved characterization of interatomic bonds in various vanado-phosphate structures by solid-state NMR will contribute to a better understanding of the structure\/property relationships in this important class of materials.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Gr\u00e9gory Tricot","Olivier Mentr\u00e9","Sylvain Cristol","Laurent Delevoye"],"doi":"10.1021\/ic300966r","first_seen_on":"2012-11-29T02:03:13+00:00","issns":["0020-1669","1520-510X"],"journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1354235936,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ic300966r"],"pmid":"23190003","pubdate":"2012-11-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"121128144202009","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"\n              Fine Hierarchy of the V\u2013O Bonds by Advanced Solid State NMR: Novel Pb\n              \n              (VO\n              \n              )(PO\n              \n              )\n              \n              Structure as a Textbook Case\n            ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fine-hierarchy-vo-bonds-advanced-solid-state-nmr-novel-pb-4vo2po43-structure-textbook-case"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5028713,"mean":5.9653160399705,"rank":3324593,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1495877,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5028713,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283653,"mean":6.0835983670132,"rank":171279,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":97086,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283653,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7201,"mean":1.0398377777778,"rank":2532,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4310,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7201,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":349,"mean":0.61189655172414,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":268,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":349,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
