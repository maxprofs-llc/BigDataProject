However, there are differing reports on its fundamental magnetic spin Hamiltonian (SH) parameters, which arise from inherent experimental challenges in detecting large zero-field splittings. There are also remarkable changes in the SH parameters of [Co(SPh)4](2-) upon structural variations, depending on the counterion and crystallization conditions. In this work, four complementary experimental techniques are utilized to unambiguously determine the SH parameters for two different salts of [Co(SPh)4](2-): (PPh4)2[Co(SPh)4] (1) and (NEt4)2[Co(SPh)4] (2). The characterization methods employed include multifield SQUID magnetometry, high-field\/high-frequency electron paramagnetic resonance (HF-EPR), variable-field variable-temperature magnetic circular dichroism (VTVH-MCD), and frequency domain Fourier transform THz-EPR (FD-FT THz-EPR). Notably, the paramagnetic Co(II) complex [Co(SPh)4](2-) shows strong axial magnetic anisotropy in 1, with D = -55(1) cm(-1) and E\/D = 0.00(3), but rhombic anisotropy is seen for 2, with D = +11(1) cm(-1) and E\/D = 0.18(3). Multireference ab initio CASSCF\/NEVPT2 calculations enable interpretation of the remarkable variation of D and its dependence on the electronic structure and geometry.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Elizaveta A.
