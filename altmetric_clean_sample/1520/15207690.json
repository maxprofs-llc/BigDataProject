Innovative technology that uses extracts obtained by supercritical CO\u2082 extraction, as a method of isolation of biologically active compounds from algal biomass, is presented. An important part of the complete technology is the final formulation of the product. This enabled realization of the further step which was assessment of the utilitarian properties of the extract-based products. The extracts were analysed for the presence of biologically active molecules (e.g., plant hormones, polyphenols) which provide useful properties such as antioxidant, antiviral, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial. The bio-products were tested in germination tests and underwent field trials to search for plant growth biostimulatory properties. Tests on animals (laying hens experiments) were conducted to assess pro-health properties of new dietary feed supplement. Another application were cosmetic formulations (dermatological tests). The results of the application tests were very promising, however further studies are required for the registration of the products and successful implementation to the market.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422e","authors":["Izabela Michalak","Michalak, Izabela","Chojnacka, Katarzyna","Saeid, Agnieszka"],"doi":"10.3390\/molecules22010066","first_seen_on":"2017-01-03T11:05:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1420-3049"],"issue":"1","journal":"Molecules","last_mentioned_on":1483714201,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/22\/1\/66?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/22\/1\/66?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28054954"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/22\/1\/66\/pdf","pmid":"28054954","pubdate":"2017-01-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"66","subjects":["biology"],"title":"Plant Growth Biostimulants, Dietary Feed Supplements and Cosmetics Formulated with Supercritical CO2 Algal Extracts","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/plant-growth-biostimulants-dietary-feed-supplements-cosmetics-formulated-supercritical-co2-algal-ext"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992937,"mean":6.7399601605663,"rank":3964989,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3823698,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992937,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254346,"mean":12.578598297588,"rank":131825,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":112804,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254346,"percentile":44},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3737,"mean":2.1109753747323,"rank":947,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":2623,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3737,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":425,"mean":1.4086650943396,"rank":116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":273,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":425,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
