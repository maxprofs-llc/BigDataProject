The ground water samples were collected from three distinct locations denoted as GW1, GW2 and GW3 at distances of about 100, 200 and 350\u00a0m respectively from the hospital location. The samples were collected during the dry season (December 2015, January and February 2016) and wet season (June, July and August 2016) and analyzed with standard procedures. The level of contamination of groundwater in the area was generally higher in the wet season than in dry season. The degree of contamination varies with distance and hence in the following order GW1\u2009>\u2009GW2\u2009>\u2009GW3 in both seasons. The study revealed the presence of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic organisms and values of the determined physicochemical ranged from (0.02\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01-272\u2009\u00b1\u20092.22\u00a0mg\/L) in both seasons. The hospital management should develop effective ways to manage their wastes to protect the environment and public health.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f61000649f","authors":["C. T. Eze","O. R.
