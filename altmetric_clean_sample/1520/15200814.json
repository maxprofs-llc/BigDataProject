This paper addresses ways people are increasingly moving to healthy living medicine (HLM) to mitigate such health threats. HLM-seekers increasingly leverage mobile technologies that enable control of personal health information, collaboration with clinicians\/other agents to establish healthy living practices. For example, outcomes from consumer health informatics research includes empowering users to take charge of their health through active participation in decision-making about healthcare delivery. Because the success of health technology depends on its alignment\/integration with a person's sociotechnical system, we introduce SEIPS 2.0 as a useful conceptual model and analytic tool. SEIPS 2.0 approaches human work (i.e., life's effortful activities) within the complexity of the design and implementation of mHealth technologies and their potential to emerge as consumer-facing NLM products that support NCDs like diabetes.","authors":["Anthony Faiola","Richard J.
