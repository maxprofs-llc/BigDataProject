Given the typically low genetic variation of clonal plants across their habitats, phenotypic plasticity may be the primary adaptive strategy allowing them to thrive across a wide range of habitats. In this study, the mechanism supporting the widespread distribution of the clonal plant Leymus chinensis was determined, i.e., phenotypic plasticity or local specialization in water use efficiency (WUE; reflected by foliar \u03b4(13)C). To test whether plasticity is required for the species to thrive in different habitats, samples were collected across its distribution in Mongolian steppe, and a controlled watering experiment was conducted with two populations at two different sites. Five populations were also transplanted from different sites into a control environment, and the foliar \u03b4(13)C was compared between the control and original habitats, to test for local specialization in WUE. Results demonstrated decreased foliar \u03b4(13)C with increasing precipitation during controlled watering experiments, with divergent responses between the two populations assessed. Change in foliar \u03b4(13)C (-3.69 \u2030) due to water addition was comparable to fluctuations of foliar \u03b4(13)C observed in situ (-4.83 \u2030). Foliar \u03b4(13)C differed by -0.91 \u2030 between two transplanted populations, however, this difference was not apparent between the two populations when growing in their original habitats. Findings provide evidence that local adaptation affects foliar \u03b4(13)C much less than phenotypic plasticity. Thus, plasticity in WUE is more important than local adaptation in allowing the clonal plant L. chinensis to occupy a wide range of habitats in Mongolian steppe.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a7b","authors":["Liu, Yanjie","Zhang, Lirong","Xu, Xingliang","Niu, Haishan","Yanjie Liu","Lirong Zhang","Xingliang Xu","Haishan Niu"],"doi":"10.1093\/aobpla\/plv141","first_seen_on":"2015-12-09T11:10:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-2851"],"journal":"AoB Plants","last_mentioned_on":1506676082,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26644341?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/aobpla.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/8\/plv141.full.pdf?ct","http:\/\/aobblog.com\/2016\/04\/greater-specific-leaf-area-plasticity-help-plants-maintain-high-performance-shaded\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/aobpla\/plv141","https:\/\/aobblog.com\/2016\/04\/greater-specific-leaf-area-plasticity-help-plants-maintain-high-performance-shaded\/","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/aobpla\/article-lookup\/doi\/10.1093\/aobpla\/plv141"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/aobpla\/article-pdf\/doi\/10.1093\/aobpla\/plv141\/8135594\/plv141.pdf","pmcid":"PMC4705351","pmid":"26644341","pubdate":"2015-12-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","startpage":"plv141","title":"Understanding the wide geographic range of a clonal perennial grass: plasticity versus local adaptation","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/understanding-wide-geographic-range-clonal-perennial-grass-plasticity-versus-local-adaptation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":15.73,"score_history":{"1y":1.95,"6m":1.95,"3m":1.95,"1m":1.95,"1w":1.95,"6d":1.95,"5d":1.95,"4d":1.95,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":15.73},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462498,"mean":7.1083922572655,"rank":566155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7896418,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462498,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":305208,"mean":9.0055293554863,"rank":26692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":278514,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":305208,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":401,"mean":7.712755,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":358,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":401,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":10.479333333333,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"researcher":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":4,"Members of the public":8}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
