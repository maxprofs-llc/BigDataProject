Our previous study revealed that the methanolic extract of Glycyrrhiza glabra L. (EGGR) exhibits significant nitric oxide (NO) inhibitory effect on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages among 100 other extracts. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to investigate the potential anti-inflammatory effect of EGGR. The anti-inflammatory effect of EGGR on LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages was measured by MTT assay, NO content analysis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level analysis, RT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and ELISA assay. Low doses of EGGR were non-toxic to macrophages and imparted protective effect against LPS induced cell death. Incubation of LPS-treated macrophages with 100 \u03bcg\/mL EGGR led to an increase in cell viability from 66.6 to 99%. Moreover, EGGR led to down regulation of NO (NO2+NO3) and ROS productions in a dose-dependent manner. In particular, 100 \u03bcg\/mL EGGR led to a reduction in NO2+NO3 level from 336.2 to 24.1 pM\/mL, and ROS level from 483.5 to 128.4%. Consistent with the result related to NO production, EGGR suppressed the ability of LPS to induce mRNA and protein expressions of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), and IL-6 productions which were analyzed by an ELISA assay. These results provide a comprehensive approach into the anti-inflammatory effect of EGGR on LPS-stimulated macrophages; however, efforts are underway on gaining detailed insight into anti-inflammatory signaling pathways.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa67d3cf058f6100097fa","authors":["Li, Chunmei","Eom, Taekil","Jeong, Yoonhwa"],"doi":"10.3177\/jnsv.61.375","first_seen_on":"2015-12-08T21:41:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1881-7742"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Nutritional Science & Vitaminology","last_mentioned_on":1449610893,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26639845?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26639845","pubdate":"2015-12-08T22:05:55+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Glycyrrhiza glabra L.
