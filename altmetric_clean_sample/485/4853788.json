The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of dicloxacillin after single and multiple oral dose in healthy Chinese volunteers.\nA single-center, open-label, randomized, two-phase study was conducted in 16 subjects. In the single-dose phase, subjects were randomly assigned to receive single doses of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 g of dicloxacillin sodium capsule in a 4-way crossover design with a 5-day washout period between administrations. In the multiple-dose phase, subjects were assigned to receive 0.25 or 0.5 g every 6 hours for 3 days in a 2-way crossover design. Plasma and urine pharmacokinetic samples were assayed by a validated high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated and analyzed statistically. Safety assessments were conducted throughout the study.\nFollowing a single oral dose of 0.25-2.0 g dicloxacillin sodium, the maximum plasma drug concentration (Cmax) and the corresponding values for the area under the concentration- time curve from 0 to 10 hours (AUC0-10 h) increased in a dose-proportional manner. The mean elimination half-life (t1\/2) was in the range of 1.38-1.71 hours. Dicloxacillin was excreted in its unchanged form via the kidney, with no tendency of accumulation, and varied from 38.65% to 50.10%. No appreciable accumulation of drug occurred with multiple oral doses of dicloxacillin. No serious adverse events were reported. Adverse events were generally mild.\nDicloxacillin was safe and well tolerated in the volunteers and displayed linear increases in the Cmax and AUC0-10 h values.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bbff","authors":["Guolan Wu","Yun-liang Zheng","Hui-li Zhou","Xing-jiang Hu","Jian Liu","You Zhai","Mei-xiang Zhu","Li-hua Wu","Jian-zhong Shentu"],"doi":"10.2147\/dddt.s92117","first_seen_on":"2015-12-08T19:07:53+00:00","issns":["1177-8881"],"journal":"Drug Design, Development and Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1445286489,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/articles.php?article_id=24186"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=27575","pmid":"26527863","pubdate":"2015-10-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Safety and pharmacokinetics of dicloxacillin in healthy Chinese volunteers following single and multiple oral doses","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/safety-pharmacokinetics-dicloxacillin-healthy-chinese-volunteers-following-single-multiple-oral-dose-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6335899,"mean":5.977107861901,"rank":5393387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6335899,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235789,"mean":9.3447946375558,"rank":183257,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235789,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":890,"mean":3.1631946006749,"rank":593,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":890,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94,"mean":2.7075268817204,"rank":74,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
