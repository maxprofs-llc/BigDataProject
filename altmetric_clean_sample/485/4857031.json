The cumulative incidence of surgery at 30 days, 6 months, 1 year, and 5 years was 3.6%, 9.4%, 14.3%, and 40.0%, respectively, and of cardiac and noncardiac surgery was 0.8%, 2.1%, 2.6%, and 4.0% and 1.3%, 5.1%, 9.1%, and 31.7%, respectively. We assessed the incidence and the predictors of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and serious bleeding event within 30 days from surgery. Cardiac death occurred in 438 patients (2.5%), myocardial infarction in 256 (1.5%), and serious bleeding event in 1099 (6.4%). Surgery increased 1.58\u00d7 the risk of cardiac death during follow-up. Along with other risk factors, the interplay between stent type and time from percutaneous coronary intervention to surgery was independently associated with cardiac death\/myocardial infarction. In comparison with bare-metal stent implanted >12 months before surgery, old-generation drug-eluting stent was associated with higher risk of events at any time point. Conversely, new-generation drug-eluting stent showed similar safety as bare-metal stent >12 months and between 6 and 12 months and appeared trendly safer between 0 and 6 months.\nSurgery is frequent in patients with coronary stents and carries a considerable risk of ischemic and bleeding events. Ischemic risk is inversely related with time from percutaneous coronary intervention to surgery and is influenced by stent type.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006ece","authors":["Francesco Saia","Laura Maria Beatrice Belotti","Paolo Guastaroba","Alessandra Berardini","Roberta Rossini","Giuseppe Musumeci","Giuseppe Tarantini","Gianluca Campo","Vincenzo Guiducci","Fabio Tarantino","Alberto Menozzi","Elisabetta Varani","Andrea Santarelli","Stefano Tondi","Rossana De Palma","Claudio Rapezzi","Antonio Marzocchi"],"doi":"10.1161\/circoutcomes.115.002155","first_seen_on":"2015-12-09T11:46:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1941-7705"],"issue":"1","journal":"Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality & Outcomes","last_mentioned_on":1449737443,"links":["http:\/\/circoutcomes.ahajournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/12\/08\/CIRCOUTCOMES.115.002155.abstract.html?ijkey=ox879yDFzKARq5C&keytype=ref","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26646819"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/circoutcomes.ahajournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/12\/08\/CIRCOUTCOMES.115.002155.full.pdf","pmid":"26646819","pubdate":"2015-12-10T22:01:36+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Risk of Adverse Cardiac and Bleeding Events Following Cardiac and Noncardiac Surgery in Patients With Coronary Stent: How Important Is the Interplay Between Stent Type and Time From Stenting to Surgery?","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/risk-adverse-cardiac-bleeding-events-following-cardiac-noncardiac-surgery-patients-coronary-stent-im"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6737133,"mean":6.1593032756354,"rank":3037113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3518720,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6737133,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282680,"mean":8.6502486636785,"rank":129565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":141045,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282680,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":610,"mean":21.355382594417,"rank":474,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":610,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":32.791473684211,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CircOutcomes\/statuses\/674554251511783424","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4857031],"posted_on":"2015-12-09T11:40:40+00:00","author":{"name":"Circulation: CVQO","url":"http:\/\/circoutcomes.ahajournals.org\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/489434233643884545\/SPstzCpn_normal.png","description":"Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes, an American Heart Association journal.
