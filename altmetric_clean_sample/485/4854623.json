These chromaffin tissue tumors are not uncommon in anesthetic practice and have varied manifestations. The perioperative management of these tumors has improved remarkably over the years, in conjunction with the evolution of surgical techniques (open laparotomy to laparoscopic techniques and now to robotic approaches in the present day). This review attempts to comprehensively address the intraoperative and postoperative issues in the management of these challenging tumors with an emphasis on hemodynamic monitoring and anesthetic technique.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa7053cf058f61000a4bd","authors":["Ramakrishna","Harish Ramakrishna"],"doi":"10.4103\/0970-9185.161665","first_seen_on":"2015-12-08T23:53:43+00:00","issns":["0970-9185"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Anaesthesiology Clinical Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1502294910,"links":["http:\/\/www.joacp.org\/article.asp?issn=0970-9185%3Byear=2015%3Bvolume=31%3Bissue=3%3Bspage=317%3Bepage=323%3Baulast=Ramakrishna","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4541176\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4541176\/","http:\/\/www.joacp.org\/article.asp?issn=0970-9185;year=2015;volume=31;issue=3;spage=317;epage=323;aulast=Ramakrishna"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.joacp.org\/article.asp?issn=0970-9185;year=2015;volume=31;issue=3;spage=317;epage=323;aulast=Ramakrishna;type=2","pmid":"26330708","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medknow Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"317","title":"Pheochromocytoma resection: Current concepts in anesthetic management","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pheochromocytoma-resection-current-concepts-anesthetic-management"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8348788,"mean":7.0413328717018,"rank":3623637,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4605749,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8348788,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":303244,"mean":9.0004729540333,"rank":112021,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":185545,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":303244,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":406,"mean":1.0763703703704,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":354,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":406,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.8722222222222,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Other":3,"Student  > Master":4,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":11,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"IN":1},"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Pheochromocytoma resection: Current concepts in anesthetic management Ramakrishna H -
