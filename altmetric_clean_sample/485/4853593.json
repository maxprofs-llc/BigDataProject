However, a quantitative and qualitative analysis of transduction patterns of the most promising rAAV serotypes for brain targeting in large animal models is missing. Here, we characterize distribution, transduction efficiency and cellular targeting of rAAV serotypes 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, rh.10, rh.39 and rh.43 delivered into the cisterna magna of wild type pigs. rAAV9 showed the highest transduction efficiency and the widest distribution capability among the vectors tested. Moreover, rAAV9 robustly transduced both glia and neurons, including the motor neurons of the spinal cord. Relevant cell transduction specificity of the glia was observed after rAAV1 and rAAV7 delivery. rAAV7 also displayed a specific tropism to Purkinje cells. Evaluation of biochemical and hematological markers suggested that all rAAV serotypes tested were well tolerated.This study provides a comprehensive CNS transduction map in a useful pre-clinical large animal model enabling the selection of potentially clinically transferable rAAV serotypes based on disease specificity. Therefore, our data are instrumental for the clinical evaluation of these rAAV vectors in human neurodegenerative diseases.Molecular Therapy (2015); doi:10.1038\/mt.2015.212.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5083cf058f61000311d","authors":["Sorrentino, Nicolina Cristina","Maffia, Veronica","Strollo, Sandra","Cacace, Vincenzo","Romagnoli, Noemi","Manfredi, Anna","Ventrella, Domenico","Dondi, Francesco","Barone, Franscesca","Giunti, Massimo","Graham, Anne-Renee","Huang, Yan","Kalled, Susan L","Auricchio, Alberto","Bacci, Maria Laura","Surace, Enrico Maria","Fraldi, Alessandro"],"doi":"10.1038\/mt.2015.212","first_seen_on":"2015-12-08T18:18:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1525-0024"],"journal":"Molecular Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1449598652,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26639405?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26639405","pubdate":"2015-12-08T22:06:56+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"A comprehensive map of CNS transduction by eight recombinant adeno-associated virus serotypes upon cerebrospinal fluid administration in pigs.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comprehensive-map-cns-transduction-eight-recombinant-adenoassociated-virus-serotypes-upon-cerebrospi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6697548,"mean":6.160080958295,"rank":3210327,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1990122,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6697548,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281300,"mean":8.6523016292271,"rank":142389,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":108747,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281300,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1079,"mean":8.2552708719852,"rank":726,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":221,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1079,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":21.914869565217,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
