However, there is an emerging spectrum of non-HPV-related cervical adenocarcinomas, the most common of which is so-called gastric type. In this review, the concept of gastric-type cervical adenocarcinomas and their possible precursor lesions is covered, the precursor lesions still being poorly understood. Other non-HPV-related cervical adenocarcinomas are also discussed, including new information regarding molecular events in mesonephric adenocarcinoma. A variety of primary vaginal adenocarcinomas, including clear cell, endometrioid, intestinal and gastric types are also discussed. The spectrum of benign and malignant glandular lesions involving the lower female genital tract and probably derived from misplaced Skene's (periurethral) glands is also covered.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f61000689e","authors":["McCluggage, W Glenn"],"doi":"10.1097\/pap.0000000000000095","first_seen_on":"2015-12-09T15:08:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1072-4109","1533-4031"],"issue":"1","journal":"Advances in Anatomic Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1453211843,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/anatomicpathology\/Abstract\/2016\/01000\/Recent_Developments_in_Non_HPV_related.7.aspx","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26645463?dopt=Citation"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/anatomicpathology\/2016\/01000\/Recent_Developments_in_Non_HPV_related.7.pdf","pmid":"26645463","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"58","subjects":["pathology","anatomy"],"title":"Recent Developments in Non-HPV-related Adenocarcinomas of the Lower Female Genital Tract and Their Precursors.","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/recent-developments-nonhpvrelated-adenocarcinomas-lower-female-genital-tract-precursors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8258564,"mean":6.9741565882523,"rank":3573135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4567845,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8258564,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":302206,"mean":9.0083542959248,"rank":111745,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":184771,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":302206,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300,"mean":2.5675317725753,"rank":129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":156,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":2.7125,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":7,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"JP":1},"mendeley":{"NL":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/histopathology\/statuses\/674605565000212480","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4857729],"posted_on":"2015-12-09T15:04:34+00:00","author":{"name":"histopathology \ud83d\udd2c","url":"http:\/\/paper.li\/histopathology","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/310148433\/pathology_lens_normal.jpg","description":"Issues about tissues","id_on_source":"histopathology","tweeter_id":"56153038","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":6104},"tweet_id":"674605565000212480"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/kriyer68\/statuses\/674977491904102400","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4857729],"posted_on":"2015-12-10T15:42:29+00:00","author":{"name":"Kalyani Bambal","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/901776699871940609\/x03-_4Vq_normal.jpg","description":"M.D.Pathology.
