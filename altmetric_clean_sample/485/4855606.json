The Keap1\/Nrf2 pathway is a critical regulator of the endogenous antioxidant response system and its dysfunction has been implicated in numerous pathologies. Here, we characterize the effect of chronic hyperglycemia on Nrf2 signaling within a diabetic cutaneous regeneration model. We characterized the effects of chronic hyperglycemia on the Keap1\/Nrf2 pathway within models of diabetic cutaneous wound regeneration. We assessed reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and antioxidant gene expression following alterations in the Nrf2 suppressor, Keap1, and the subsequent changes in Nrf2 signaling. We also developed a topical siRNA-based therapy to restore redox homeostasis within diabetic wounds. Western blot demonstrated that chronic hyperglycemia-associated oxidative stress inhibits nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and impairs activation of antioxidant genes, thus contributing to ROS accumulation. Keap1 inhibition increased Nrf2 nuclear translocation, increased antioxidant gene expression, and reduced ROS production to normoglycemic levels, both in vitro and in vivo. Topical siKeap1 therapy resulted in improved regenerative capacity of diabetic wounds and accelerated closure. We report that chronic hyperglycemia weakens the endogenous antioxidant response and the consequences of this defect are manifested by intracellular redox dysregulation, which can be restored by Keap1 inhibition. Targeted siRNA-based therapy represents a novel, efficacious strategy to reestablish redox homeostasis and accelerate diabetic cutaneous tissue regeneration.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026f7","authors":["Marc A.
