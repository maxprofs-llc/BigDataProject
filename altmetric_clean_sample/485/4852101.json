DEPTOR shows abnormal expressions in numerous types of solid tumors. However, how DEP-TOR is expressed in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains elusive.\nThe expression of DEPTOR in 220 cases of ESCC and non-cancerous adjacent tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry. DEPTOR levels in ESCC and paired normal tissue were quantified using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis to verify the immunohistochemical results. The relationship between DEPTOR expression and the clinicopathological features of ESCC was analyzed based on the results of immunohistochemistry. Finally, we analyzed the relationship between DEPTOR expression and the prognosis of patients with ESCC.\nImmunohistochemical staining showed that the expression rate of DEPTOR in ESCC tissues was significantly increased. DEPTOR mRNA and protein expression was significantly higher in ESCC tissues than in normal adjacent esophageal squamous tissues. High DEPTOR expression was significantly correlated with regional lymph node status in the TNM stage of patients with ESCC. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that the rate of overall survival was significantly lower in patients with high DEPTOR expression than in those with low DEPTOR expression. Additionally, high DEPTOR expression was an independent prognostic predictor for ESCC patients.\nHigh DEPTOR expression is an independent prognostic biomarker indicating a worse prognosis for patients with ESCC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bca2","authors":["Liu, Nan-Bo","Zhang, Jun-Hua","Liu, Yu-Fan","Li, Jun","Zhang, Zhen-Zhong","Li, Ji-Wei","Liu, Wen-Yue","Huang, Chen","Shen, Tao","Gu, Cheng-Wei","Gao, Dong-Yun","Wu, Xia","Wu, Xu"],"doi":"10.2147\/ott.s92862","first_seen_on":"2015-12-08T11:30:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1178-6930"],"journal":"OncoTargets and therapy","last_mentioned_on":1449574235,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26640385?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/articles.php?article_id=24677"],"pmcid":"PMC4657798","pmid":"26640385","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"title":"High DEPTOR expression correlates with poor prognosis in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/high-deptor-expression-correlates-poor-prognosis-patients-esophageal-squamous-cell-carcinoma-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6697548,"mean":6.160080958295,"rank":4961574,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":977114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6697548,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281301,"mean":8.6522922004975,"rank":190051,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":54233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281301,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":801,"mean":1.26685,"rank":388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":318,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":801,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":215,"mean":0.81985981308411,"rank":76,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":215,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/674189324653432832","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4852101],"posted_on":"2015-12-08T11:30:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":727},"tweet_id":"674189324653432832"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Timeline Photos","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=945551852180019&id=378199102248633","license":"public","citation_ids":[4852101],"posted_on":"2015-11-24T20:19:30+00:00","summary":"High DEPTOR expression correlates with poor prognosis in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma\n\nObjective: The disheveled, Egl-10, and pleckstrin (DEP) domain containing mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-interacting protein (DEPTOR) is a bind","author":{"name":"Dove Medical Press","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/378199102248633","facebook_wall_name":"Dove Medical Press","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/378199102248633\/picture","id_on_source":"378199102248633"}}]}}
