Here, it is shown that topical Q10 treatment is beneficial with regard to effective Q10 replenishment, augmentation of cellular energy metabolism, and antioxidant effects. Application of Q10-containing formulas significantly increased the levels of this quinone on the skin surface. In the deeper layers of the epidermis the ubiquinone level was significantly augmented indicating effective supplementation. Concurrent elevation of ubiquinol levels suggested metabolic transformation of ubiquinone resulting from increased energy metabolism. Incubation of cultured human keratinocytes with Q10 concentrations equivalent to treated skin showed a significant augmentation of energy metabolism. Moreover, the results demonstrated that stressed skin benefits from the topical Q10 treatment by reduction of free radicals and an increase in antioxidant capacity. \u00a9 2015 BioFactors, 2015.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023cd","authors":["Knott, Anja","Achterberg, Volker","Smuda, Christoph","Mielke, Heiko","Sperling, Gabi","Dunckelmann, Katja","Vogelsang, Alexandra","Kr\u00fcger, Andrea","Schwengler, Helge","Behtash, Mojgan","Kristof, Sonja","Diekmann, Heike","Eisenberg, Tanya","Berroth, Andreas","Hildebrand, Janosch","Siegner, Ralf","Winnefeld, Marc","Teuber, Frank","Fey, Sven","M\u00f6bius, Janne","Retzer, Dana","Burkhardt, Thorsten","L\u00fcttke, Juliane","Blatt, Thomas"],"doi":"10.1002\/biof.1239","endpage":"390","first_seen_on":"2015-12-09T11:48:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1872-8081"],"issue":"6","journal":"Biofactors","last_mentioned_on":1454513933,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/biof.1239&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/biof.1239\/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview&hootPostID=2ef9c47e9399b75fc7b64c7f237fb3d5","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/biof.1239\/abstract?campaign=woletoc&hootPostID=fc583f0db54930938bc48ff81c2cfb6f","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/biof.1239\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/biof.1239\/full","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/biof.1239"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/biof.1239\/pdf","pmid":"26648450","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"383","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Topical treatment with coenzyme Q10\u2010containing formulas improves skin's Q10 level and provides antioxidative effects","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/topical-treatment-coenzyme-q10containing-formulas-improves-skins-q10-level-provides-antioxidative-ef"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7089314,"mean":6.2945947100909,"rank":2630011,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4407091,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7089314,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":288104,"mean":8.7758763220097,"rank":93278,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":192246,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":288104,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":416,"mean":3.0529108433735,"rank":136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":274,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":416,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":0.94,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
