Each subject was administered the BNT as part of a larger neuropsychological battery. A standardized five-step statistical procedure was used to generate the norms.\nThe final multiple linear regression models explained between 4-33% of the variance in BNT scores. Although t-tests showed significant differences between men and women for Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Cuba, Guatemala, and Bolivia on the BNT, none of the six countries had an effect size larger than 0.3. As a result, gender-adjusted norms were not generated.\nThis is the first normative multicenter study conducted in Latin America to generate norms for the BNT; this study will have substantial repercussions for the practice of neuropsychology throughout the global region.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031a9","authors":["Olabarrieta-Landa, L","Rivera, D","Morlett-Paredes, A","Jaimes-Bautista, A","Garza, M T","Galarza, F","Rodr\u00edguez, W","R\u00e1bago, B","Schebela, S","Perrin, B P","Luna, M","Longoni, M","Ocampo, N","Aliaga, A","Saracho, C P","Bringas, M","Esenarro, L","Garc\u00eda-Egan, P","Arango-Lasprilla, J C"],"doi":"10.3233\/nre-151278","first_seen_on":"2015-12-08T15:02:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1878-6448"],"issue":"4","journal":"NeuroRehabilitation","last_mentioned_on":1449586903,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26639925?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26639925","pubdate":"2015-12-08T22:05:52+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine","neurology"],"title":"Standard form of the boston naming test: Normative data for the Latin American Spanish speaking adult population.","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/standard-form-boston-naming-test-normative-data-latin-american-spanish-speaking-adult-population"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6697548,"mean":6.160080958295,"rank":5720912,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6697548,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281300,"mean":8.652327047021,"rank":227077,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281300,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":373,"mean":3.484247311828,"rank":272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":373,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.2391304347826,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
