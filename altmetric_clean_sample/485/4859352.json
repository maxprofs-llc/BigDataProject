Factors investigated that may affect outcome were patient gender, age, side of the stone, largest stone size, stone burden, number of stones, location of a single stone, previous intervention history and instrument size.\nMean patient age was 8.51 \u00b1 4.91 years, male-to-female ratio was 209\/137. Mean stone burden was 3.49 \u00b1 3.3 cm(2). The stone-free rate after a single procedure was 73.1% and 84.4%, respectively, in patients without and with clinically insignificant residual stones. In univariate and multivariate analyses, stone burden and number of stones affected the stone-free rate. The complications were bleeding in 41 (11.8%) patients, postoperative urinary tract infection in 21 (6%), urosepsis in 4 (0.1%) and hydrothorax in 4 (0.1%); 1 patient died of multiple organ failure. Over the years, blood transfusion and complication rates decreased, and the use of smaller instruments increased significantly. Although bleeding occurred less often in patients operated using a 14F sheath rather than the larger sheath (5% vs. 12%, P = 0.142), the difference was not significant. No significant factor affecting the complication rates was detected.\nAs in the adults, PCNL can be used in children with acceptable complication and considerable success rates for surgical treatment complex renal stones. The number of stones and stone burden are predictive factors for the postoperative stone-free rate.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f12","authors":["Citamak, B","Altan, M","Bozaci, A C","Koni, A","Dogan, H S","Bilen, C Y","Sahin, A","Tekgul, S"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.juro.2015.11.070","first_seen_on":"2015-12-10T02:26:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0022-5347","1527-3792"],"journal":"The Journal of Urology","last_mentioned_on":1451214987,"links":["http:\/\/www.jurology.com\/article\/S0022-5347(15)05394-X\/abstract?rss=yes","http:\/\/www.jurology.com\/article\/S0022-5347(15)05394-X\/abstract","http:\/\/www.jurology.com\/article\/S0022-5347%2815%2905394-X\/abstract","http:\/\/www.jurology.com\/article\/S0022-5347(15)05394-X\/abstract#.Vn5mY3nfJjI.twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jurology.com\/article\/S002253471505394X\/pdf","pmid":"26682755","pubdate":"2015-12-20T22:01:01+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy in Children: 17 Years of Experience","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/percutaneous-nephrolithotomy-children-17-years-experience-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6884314,"mean":6.1787773952151,"rank":1288280,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":5590124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6884314,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285296,"mean":8.676704428749,"rank":64449,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":220466,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285296,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7051,"mean":4.0387086524823,"rank":996,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6043,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7051,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":396,"mean":7.3269873417722,"rank":73,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":322,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":396,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":3,"FR":1,"ES":1,"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/UrologyMatch\/statuses\/674759523878457345","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4859352],"posted_on":"2015-12-10T01:16:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Urology Match","url":"http:\/\/www.urologymatch.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/670243589750935552\/vkJCRb_7_normal.jpg","description":"Premier Internet portal to keep abreast of the exciting field of Urology.
