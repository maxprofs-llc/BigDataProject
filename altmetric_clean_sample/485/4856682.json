Although some viruses have been shown to deeply affect the biology and evolution of parasitoid wasps, the genetic and phenotypic diversity of parasitoid-associated viruses remain largely unexplored. We previously discovered a behaviour-manipulating DNA virus in the parasitoid wasp Leptopilina boulardi. In this species which lays its eggs inside Drosophila larvae, Leptopilina boulardi Filamentous Virus (LbFV) forces the females to lay their eggs into already parasitized Drosophila larvae. This behavioural manipulation increases the chances for the horizontal transmission of the virus. Here, we describe in the same parasitoid species another virus that we propose to call LbTV for Leptopilina boulardi Toti-like Virus. This dsRNA virus is highly prevalent in insect laboratory lines as well as in parasitoids caught in the field. In some cases, LbTV was found in coinfection with LbFV, but did not affect the behaviour of the wasp. Instead we found that the presence of LbTV correlates with an increase in the number of offspring, mostly due to an increased survival of parasitoid larvae. LbTV is vertically-transmitted mostly through the maternal lineage even if frequent paternal transmission also occurs. Unlike LbFV, LbTV is not horizontally transmitted. Its genome encodes a putative RNA-dependant RNA polymerase (RdRp) showing similarities with RdRps of Totiviridae. These results underline the high incidence and diversity of inherited viruses in parasitoids as well as their potential impact on the phenotype of their hosts.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c9c","authors":["Martinez, Julien","Lepetit, David","Ravallec, Marc","Fleury, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric","Varaldi, Julien","Julien Martinez","David Lepetit","Marc Ravallec","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Fleury","Julien Varaldi"],"doi":"10.1099\/jgv.0.000360","first_seen_on":"2015-12-09T11:02:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1465-2099"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of General Virology","last_mentioned_on":1466522987,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26642803?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/jgv.microbiologyresearch.org\/content\/journal\/jgv\/10.1099\/jgv.0.000360"],"pmid":"26642803","pubdate":"2015-12-09T22:05:51+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"An additional heritable virus in the parasitic wasp Leptopilina boulardi: prevalence, transmission and phenotypic effects.","type":"article","volume":"97","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/additional-heritable-virus-parasitic-wasp-leptopilina-boulardi-prevalence-transmission-phenotypic-ef"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7926939,"mean":6.7044594278339,"rank":3371939,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4441923,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7926939,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":298093,"mean":8.8879918213167,"rank":109736,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":182645,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":298093,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1643,"mean":3.0654445797808,"rank":909,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":717,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1643,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":3.9696551724138,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
