We explore the impacts of MS on employment, career development, and community living, and the implications for rehabilitation professionals.\nThe objective in this article is to provide a current and comprehensive review of the etiology and symptoms, incidence and prevalence, and current treatment strategies for MS, and the effects of MS on vocational and psychosocial outcomes.\nThis analysis represents a comprehensive review of the relevant medical, vocational, community living, and rehabilitation research literature.\nLiving with MS is associated with wide-ranging and unpredictable effects on employment, career development, and community independence. Effective responses by health and rehabilitation professionals require a comprehensive understanding of this progressive and complex condition and its psychosocial impacts.\nCustomized interventions from allied health professionals and rehabilitation counselors that are grounded in the unique features of MS and that reflect current best practices in Vocational Rehabilitation are required to improve rehabilitation outcomes for people with MS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5683cf058f610004ae1","authors":["Bishop, Malachy","Rumrill, Phillip D"],"doi":"10.3233\/wor-152200","first_seen_on":"2015-12-08T12:01:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1875-9270"],"issue":"4","journal":"Work","last_mentioned_on":1449576067,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26639011?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26639011","pubdate":"2015-12-08T22:07:50+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mechanical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["occupationalmedicine"],"title":"Multiple sclerosis: Etiology, symptoms, incidence and prevalence, and implications for community living and employment.","type":"article","volume":"52","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multiple-sclerosis-etiology-symptoms-incidence-prevalence-implications-community-living-employment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6697548,"mean":6.160080958295,"rank":5720885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6697548,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281300,"mean":8.6523339791466,"rank":227071,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281300,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":375,"mean":3.9126470588235,"rank":319,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":375,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":3.152380952381,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
