Therefore, using cryopreserved ovarian tissue to postpone menopause (tissue hormone therapy [THT]) seems to be an interesting option to avoid conventional menopause hormone therapy (MHT). Pregnancy induction and replacing MHT by THT, however, are completely different topics as different requirements need to be met. First, MHT requires long-lasting and continuous hormone production. It still needs to be proven if the transplanted tissue is active for at least 5 years with a continuous follicle growth to avoid phases with low oestrogen production, which would otherwise cause menopausal symptoms and could reduce the postulated benefit for women's health. Second, the advantage of a physiological hormone production over a non-physiological MHT is still hypothetical. Third, women who have undergone hysterectomies who do not need progesterone for endometrial protection would only require oestrogens, imposing more health benefits (cardiovascular system, mammary gland) than oestrogen and progesterone production or replacement. Therefore, transplanting ovarian tissue exclusively to postpone menopause is endocrinologically doubtful and should only be carried out within clinical trials.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f61000345c","authors":["von Wolff, Michael","Stute, Petra"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.rbmo.2015.08.010","first_seen_on":"2015-12-09T18:07:23+00:00","issns":["1472-6491","1472-6483"],"journal":"Reproductive BioMedicine Online","last_mentioned_on":1450296452,"links":["http:\/\/www.rbmojournal.com\/article\/S1472-6483(15)00418-6\/abstract","http:\/\/www.rbmojournal.com\/article\/S1472-6483(15)00418-6\/fulltext?sf17110942=1","http:\/\/www.rbmojournal.com\/article\/S1472-6483(15)00418-6\/fulltext?sf17111049=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.rbmojournal.com\/article\/S1472648315004186\/pdf","pmid":"26380862","pubdate":"2015-01-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Cryopreservation and transplantation of ovarian tissue exclusively to postpone menopause: technically possible but endocrinologically doubtful","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cryopreservation-transplantation-ovarian-tissue-exclusively-postpone-menopause-technically-possible"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6777408,"mean":6.1700063558217,"rank":2679285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4017748,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6777408,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283527,"mean":8.6775381446498,"rank":106661,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":172693,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283527,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":696,"mean":6.3898992805755,"rank":249,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":439,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":696,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":1.5727272727273,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
