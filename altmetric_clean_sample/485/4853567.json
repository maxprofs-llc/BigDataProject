In the present study, we tried to determine whether 2% Creatine monohydrate supplementation for variable duration influence the IL-6 and 18 concentrations in the serum of male albino mouse following right common carotid artery ligation and hypoxia (8% oxygen) for 25 minutes. Our result revealed that serum concentration of IL6 (P=0.0001) as well as IL-18 (P=0.003) were significantly higher in mice supplemented with creatine monohydrate for 15 weeks than in male albino mice on normal rodent diet following hypoxic ischemic insult indicating that long term creatine monohydrate supplementation up regulates the IL-6 and IL-18 concentrations triggering the neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective responses.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6a13cf058f610009a10","authors":["Iqbal, Shahid","Ali, Muhammad","Iqbal, Furhan"],"first_seen_on":"2015-12-08T18:08:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1011-601X"],"issue":"6","journal":"Pakistan Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1449614583,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26639507?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26639507","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["chemistry","pharmacology"],"title":"Effect of creatine monohydrate supplementation on relative serum level of IL-6 and IL-18 following neonatal hypoxia ischemia in male albino mouse.","type":"article","volume":"28"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6697548,"mean":6.160080958295,"rank":4961621,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":977056,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6697548,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281300,"mean":8.6523067838846,"rank":190055,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":54224,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281300,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":296,"mean":1.3956610169492,"rank":123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":134,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":296,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":0.57647058823529,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/hypoxiapapers\/statuses\/674289474142994433","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4853567],"posted_on":"2015-12-08T18:08:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Hypoxia Adaptation","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/491585034201989120\/716F2y0d_normal.png","description":"A feed for hypoxia related papers published in NCBI, ArXiv, bioArxiv, and PeerJ","id_on_source":"hypoxiapapers","tweeter_id":"2669362848","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":407},"tweet_id":"674289474142994433"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Immunol_papers\/statuses\/674358557534359552","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4853567],"posted_on":"2015-12-08T22:43:03+00:00","author":{"name":"ImmunologyPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507527250015576065\/AHPc4B-C_normal.png","description":"A TwitterBot for #Immunology papers on #PubMed searching for adaptive, innate and cyto\/chemokine.
