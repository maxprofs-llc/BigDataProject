B cell receptor (BCR) signaling is a major source of gene expression signature important for B cell. It is still unclear the mechanism by which the expression of functionally important genes is continuously deregulated in malignant lymphomas. Using RISC-capture assay, we reveal that multiple BCR signaling factors are persistently regulated by microRNA (miRNA) in human B cells. Clinical samples from patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL, n\u2009=\u200983) show loss of an essential miRNA set (miR-200c, miR-203, miR-31). Conventional screening and RISC profiling identify multiple targets (CD79B, SYK, PKC\u03b2II, PLC\u03b31, IKK\u03b2, NIK, MYD88, PI3K class I (\u03b1\/\u03b2\/\u03b4\/\u03b3), RasGRP3); signaling network habitually faces interference composed by miRNA group in normal B cells. We demonstrate that simultaneous depletion of the key miRNAs enhances translation of the multiple targets and causes chronic activation of NF-\u03baB, PI3K-Akt, and Ras-Erk cascades, leading to B cell transformation. This study suggests that compensatory actions by multiple miRNAs rather than by a single miRNA ensure robustness of biological processes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Yamagishi, Makoto","Katano, Harutaka","Hishima, Tsunekazu","Shimoyama, Tatsu","Ota, Yasunori","Nakano, Kazumi","Ishida, Takaomi","Okada, Seiji","Watanabe, Toshiki"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep17868","first_seen_on":"2015-12-08T19:54:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1450159281,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26639163?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep17868"],"pmcid":"PMC4671098","pmid":"26639163","pubdate":"2015-12-08T22:07:32+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"B-cell lymphoma","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Cell signalling","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"miRNAs","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Coordinated loss of microRNA group causes defenseless signaling in malignant lymphoma","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/coordinated-loss-microrna-group-causes-defenseless-signaling-malignant-lymphoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6771968,"mean":6.1646290473641,"rank":3273256,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1999225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6771968,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282377,"mean":8.6645088817746,"rank":143071,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":109042,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282377,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24047,"mean":14.217802794644,"rank":14133,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":7471,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24047,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2358,"mean":14.955679253288,"rank":1402,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":690,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2358,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
