In all radiation therapies, knowledge of the radiation dose received by the target, and other organs in the body is essential to evaluate the risks and benefits of any procedure. We report a case of liver metastases from a rectal neuroendocrine tumor, which was treated with Y DOTANOC. Posttreatment whole-body planar images were acquired through Bremsstrahlung radiations of Y on a \u03b3-camera, and thoracolumbar PET\/CT images were acquired on PET.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f10","authors":["Abd\u00fclrezzak, \u00dcmm\u00fchan","Kula, Mustafa","Tutu\u015f, Ahmet","Buyukkaya, Fikret","Karaca, Halit","Tutus, Ahmet"],"doi":"10.1097\/rlu.0000000000000894","first_seen_on":"2015-12-09T07:51:44+00:00","issns":["1536-0229","0363-9762"],"issue":"10","journal":"Clinical Nuclear Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1460753333,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nuclearmed\/Fulltext\/2015\/10000\/PET_CT_and_Bremsstrahlung_Imaging_After_90Y.7.aspx?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26204211?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nuclearmed\/Abstract\/2015\/10000\/PET_CT_and_Bremsstrahlung_Imaging_After_90Y.7.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/nuclearmed\/2015\/10000\/PET_CT_and_Bremsstrahlung_Imaging_After_90Y.7.pdf","pmid":"26204211","pubdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"799","subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"PET\/CT and Bremsstrahlung Imaging After 90Y DOTANOC Therapy for Rectal Net With Liver Metastases","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nuclearmed\/Fulltext\/2015\/10000\/PET_CT_and_Bremsstrahlung_Imaging_After_90Y.7.aspx","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/petct-bremsstrahlung-imaging-after-90y-dotanoc-therapy-rectal-net-liver-metastases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7554544,"mean":6.5226894405088,"rank":3684451,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3678745,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7554544,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":293682,"mean":8.8649827125349,"rank":138287,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":143724,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":293682,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2209,"mean":1.0595135869565,"rank":446,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":1625,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2209,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106,"mean":1.507619047619,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"PET\/CT and Bremsstrahlung Imaging After 90Y DOTANOC Therapy... : Clinical Nuclear Medicine","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1009879405699408&id=283600854993937","license":"public","citation_ids":[4856081],"posted_on":"2015-09-19T02:50:40+00:00","summary":"Abstract: Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy with 177Lu or 90Y is promising with successful results in somatostatin receptor\u2013positive tumors.
