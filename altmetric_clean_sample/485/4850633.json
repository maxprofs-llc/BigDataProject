The biological characteristics of porcine MSCs were investigated while cultured in vitro on composite scaffold enriched with magnetic nanoparticles. Our data indicate that due to the synergic effect of the poly-\u03b5-caprolactone nanofibers and magnetic particles, cellular adhesion and proliferation of MSCs is enhanced and osteogenic differentiation is supported. The cellular and physical attributes make this new scaffold very promising for the acceleration of efficient MSC proliferation and regeneration of hard tissues.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f610007966","authors":["Jana Da\u0148kov\u00e1","Matej Buzgo","Jana Vejpravov\u00e1","Simona Kub\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1","V\u011bra Sovkov\u00e1","Lucie Vyslou\u017eilov\u00e1","Alice Mantl\u00edkov\u00e1","Ev\u017een Amler","Alois Ne\u010das"],"doi":"10.2147\/ijn.s93670","first_seen_on":"2015-12-08T02:30:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1178-2013"],"journal":"International Journal of Nanomedicine","last_mentioned_on":1449631613,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/highly-efficient-mesenchymal-stem-cell-proliferation-on-poly-epsilon-c-peer-reviewed-article-IJN"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=28277","pmcid":"PMC4677649","pmid":"26677321","pubdate":"2015-12-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Highly efficient mesenchymal stem cell proliferation on poly-&epsilon;-caprolactone nanofibers with embedded magnetic nanoparticles","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highly-efficient-mesenchymal-stem-cell-proliferation-poly%CE%B5caprolactone-nanofibers-embedded-magnetic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6717285,"mean":6.1598756482513,"rank":2438568,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4235031,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6717285,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281452,"mean":8.660272168157,"rank":94710,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":183787,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281452,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1624,"mean":2.0730609981516,"rank":255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":1313,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1624,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":7.3772222222222,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":60,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
