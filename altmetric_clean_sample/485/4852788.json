The algorithm i) is built around a 0.05\u00b0 climatology that incorporates satellite information to represent sparsely gauged locations, ii) incorporates daily, pentadal, and monthly 1981-present 0.05\u00b0 CCD-based precipitation estimates, iii) blends station data to produce a preliminary information product with a latency of about 2 days and a final product with an average latency of about 3 weeks, and iv) uses a novel blending procedure incorporating the spatial correlation structure of CCD-estimates to assign interpolation weights. We present the CHIRPS algorithm, global and regional validation results, and show how CHIRPS can be used to quantify the hydrologic impacts of decreasing precipitation and rising air temperatures in the Greater Horn of Africa. Using the Variable Infiltration Capacity model, we show that CHIRPS can support effective hydrologic forecasts and trend analyses in southeastern Ethiopia.","altmetric_jid":"55f17ebf2a83ee43768b4583","authors":["Chris Funk","Pete Peterson","Martin Landsfeld","Diego Pedreros","James Verdin","Shraddhanand Shukla","Gregory Husak","James Rowland","Laura Harrison","Andrew Hoell","Joel Michaelsen"],"doi":"10.1038\/sdata.2015.66","first_seen_on":"2015-12-08T14:14:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["2052-4463"],"journal":"Scientific Data","last_mentioned_on":1477872000,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/sdata201566"],"pmcid":"PMC4672685","pmid":"26646728","pubdate":"2015-12-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Climate-change impacts","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Hydrology","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Environmental sciences","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Attribution","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Atmospheric dynamics","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"150066","title":"The climate hazards infrared precipitation with stations\u2014a new environmental record for monitoring extremes","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/climate-hazards-infrared-precipitation-stationsa-new-environmental-record-monitoring-extremes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":63.83,"score_history":{"1y":12.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":63.83},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7901239,"mean":6.6880063967136,"rank":127566,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":7773916,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7901239,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":296769,"mean":8.8959118907697,"rank":7858,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":288911,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":296769,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257,"mean":34.5610390625,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":23.376782608696,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":8,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":12,"Researcher":51,"Student  > Ph.
