Here, we ask whether similar biases are present in visual foraging in younger siblings of children with a diagnosis of ASD with or without additional high levels of hyperactivity and inattention.\nFifty-four low-risk controls (LR) and 50 high-risk siblings (HR) took part in an eye-tracking study at 8 and 14 months and at 3 years of age.\nAt 8 months, siblings of children with ASD and low levels of hyperactivity\/inattention (HR\/ASD-HI) were more likely to return to previously visited areas in the visual scene than were LR and siblings of children with ASD and high levels of hyperactivity\/inattention (HR\/ASD+HI).\nWe show that visual foraging is atypical in infants at-risk for ASD. We also reveal a paradoxical effect, in that additional family risk for ADHD core symptoms mitigates the effect of ASD risk on visual information foraging.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6203cf058f610007b88","authors":["Gliga, Teodora","Smith, Tim J","Likely, Noreen","Charman, Tony","Johnson, Mark H"],"doi":"10.1177\/1087054715616490","first_seen_on":"2015-12-08T09:44:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1557-1246"],"journal":"Journal of Attention Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1449593609,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26637842","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26637842\/"],"pmid":"26637842","pubdate":"2015-12-08T22:10:12+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Early Visual Foraging in Relationship to Familial Risk for Autism and Hyperactivity\/Inattention.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/early-visual-foraging-relationship-familial-risk-autism-hyperactivityinattention"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6697548,"mean":6.160080958295,"rank":2947123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":3693946,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6697548,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281300,"mean":8.6523254472997,"rank":125879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":152449,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281300,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":640,"mean":4.806813771518,"rank":320,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":314,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":640,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":2.7716666666667,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
