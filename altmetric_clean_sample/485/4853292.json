However, there is limited information on the evolution of BMD during a bisphosphonate holiday. Our study analyzed the longitudinal course of BMD following bisphosphonate discontinuation and assessed its determinants.\nRetrospective single-center cohort study of osteoporosis patients treated with alendronate or risedronate for at least 2\u00a0years and then discontinued their bisphosphonate for a drug holiday. Patients were stratified by bisphosphonate type and by fracture occurrence during drug holiday.\nA total of 208 patients were included in this analysis (87.5\u00a0% female). At the time of bisphosphonate cessation, mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD age was 66.9\u2009\u00b1\u20098.9\u00a0years and BMI 24.5\u2009\u00b1\u20094.4\u00a0kg\/m(2). Duration of bisphosphonate treatment was 5.2\u2009\u00b1\u20092.3\u00a0years, and follow-up during holiday was 3.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7\u00a0years. During the first 2\u00a0years of the holiday, BMD remained stable at the lumbar spine and femoral neck, but declined significantly at the total hip. BMD declined significantly at all sites thereafter. Significant predictors of BMD decline during bisphosphonate holiday included lower BMI at the start of the holiday and change in body weight during the holiday. BMD decline was more pronounced in former risedronate compared to former alendronate users. BMD trends were similar in patients who sustained vs. did not sustain a fracture during the holiday.\nBMD at the total hip declines significantly within 1\u00a0year of bisphosphonate discontinuation, particularly in lean patients. Additional studies are needed to identify predictors of fracture incidence during a bisphosphonate holiday.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f61000326e","authors":["L. H. R. Xu","B. Adams-Huet","J. R.
