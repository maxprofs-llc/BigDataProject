The combinations of chemo-photothermal and chemo-chemo treatments have been reported to be potential solutions to overcome drug resistance. In this study, we developed a dual-in-dual synergistic therapy based on the use of dual anticancer drug-loaded graphene oxide (GO) stabilized with poloxamer 188 for generating heat and delivering drugs to kill cancer cells under near infrared (NIR) laser irradiation. The nano-comparable system is stable and uniform in size, generating sufficient heat to induce cell death. Dual drugs (doxorubicin and irinotecan)-loaded GO (GO-DI) in combination with laser irradiation caused higher cytotoxicity than that caused by the administration of a free single drug as well as a combination of drugs and blank GO in various cancer cells, especially in MDA-MB-231 cells, resistant breast cancer cells. Exposure to \"hot\" NIR and GO-DI activated the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, which was confirmed based on changes in the morphology of cell nuclei and overexpression of apoptosis-related proteins. Based on the results, the combined treatment showed a synergistic effect compared to the effect of chemotherapy or photothermal treatment alone, demonstrating higher therapeutic efficacy to overcome one of the most severe problem in anticancer therapy, that of intrinsic resistance to chemotherapeutics.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f61000680f","authors":["Tran, Tuan Hiep","Nguyen, Hanh Thuy","Pham, Tung Thanh","Choi, Ju Yeon","Choi, Han-Gon","Yong, Chul Soon","Kim, Jong Oh"],"doi":"10.1021\/acsami.5b10426","first_seen_on":"2015-12-08T11:31:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1944-8252"],"issue":"51","journal":"ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces","last_mentioned_on":1449574271,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26641922?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26641922","pubdate":"2015-12-08T22:01:26+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Macromolecular And Materials Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
