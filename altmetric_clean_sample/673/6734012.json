[Subjects and Methods] Three hundred and forty-four farmers, aged 20-59 years old, were asked to answer a questionnaire modified from the Standard Nordic Questionnaire (Thai version). The questionnaire sought demographic, back-related, and psychosocial data. [Results] The results showed that the prevalence of low back pain was 83.1%. Farmers younger than 45\u2005years old who worked in the field fewer than six days were more likely to experience low back pain than those who worked for at least six days. Farmers with high stress levels were more likely to have low back pain. [Conclusion] In the rice transplanting process, the low back pain experienced by the farmers was associated with the weekly work duration and stress.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a8f","authors":["Keawduangdee, Petcharat","Puntumetakul, Rungthip","Swangnetr, Manida","Laohasiriwong, Wongsa","Settheetham, Dariwan","Yamauchi, Junichiro","Boucaut, Rose","Petcharat Keawduangdee","Rungthip Puntumetakul","Manida Swangnetr","Wongsa Laohasiriwong","Dariwan Settheetham","Junichiro Yamauchi","Rose Boucaut"],"doi":"10.1589\/jpts.27.2239","endpage":"2245","first_seen_on":"2016-04-15T10:31:08+00:00","handle":"11541.2\/111525","handles":["11541.2\/111525"],"issns":["0915-5287","2187-5626"],"issue":"7","journal":"Journal of Physical Therapy Science","last_mentioned_on":1487550049,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4540856\/pdf\/jpts-27-2239.pdf","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1589\/jpts.27.2239"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.jstage.jst.go.jp\/article\/jpts\/27\/7\/27_jpts-2015-134\/_pdf","pmid":"26311961","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Society of Physical Therapy Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"2239","title":"Prevalence of low back pain and associated factors among farmers during the rice transplanting process","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/www.jstage.jst.go.jp\/article\/jpts\/27\/7\/27_jpts-2015-134\/_article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-low-back-pain-associated-actors-among-farmers-during-rice-transplanting-process"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8247986,"mean":6.9694821610306,"rank":7133928,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8247986,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":273749,"mean":11.54989898739,"rank":230447,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":273749,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":948,"mean":3.2774276663147,"rank":783,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":948,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":2.8561538461538,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Environmental Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Retlouping\/statuses\/833471431543492610","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6734012],"posted_on":"2017-02-20T00:20:49+00:00","author":{"name":"David Poulter","url":"http:\/\/youtu.be\/u3BwXOkbWCo","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/726196054060720130\/aKmCy0Ul_normal.jpg","description":"All my opinions are my own.
