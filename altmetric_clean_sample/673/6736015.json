This collection was tested for azithromycin susceptibility using Etest and screened for the presence of erm(A), erm(B), erm(C), erm(F), mef(A) and mef(E) using locked nucleic acid dual-labelled hydrolysis probes.\nThe azithromycin MICs ranged from 0.09 to >256 mg\/L, with 2 (1.2%) isolates susceptible, 163 (94.8%) intermediate and 7 (4%) resistant according to EUCAST breakpoints (susceptible, \u22640.12 mg\/L; resistant, >4 mg\/L). None of the acquired macrolide resistance genes erm(A), erm(B), erm(C), erm(F), mef(A) or mef(E) was detected in any of the isolates.\nThe specific acquired macrolide resistance genes are not widespread in H. influenzae and the high prevalence of these genes previously reported might be unique to the specific circumstances of that study.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c89","authors":["Atkinson, Christopher T","Kunde, Dale A","Tristram, Stephen G"],"doi":"10.1093\/jac\/dkv093","endpage":"2236","first_seen_on":"2016-04-15T11:16:47+00:00","issns":["1460-2091","0305-7453"],"issue":"8","journal":"Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (JAC)","last_mentioned_on":1460714961,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25896520?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25896520","pubdate":"2015-08-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"2234","subjects":["drugtherapy"],"title":"\n              Acquired macrolide resistance genes in\n              Haemophilus influenzae\n              ?: Table\u00a01.\n            ","type":"article","volume":"70","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/acquired-macrolide-resistance-genes-ihaemophilus-influenzaei-table1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7554544,"mean":6.5226894405088,"rank":6543325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7554544,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268607,"mean":11.35106005078,"rank":226281,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268607,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3167,"mean":5.1627094125079,"rank":2876,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3167,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117,"mean":7.1231724137931,"rank":104,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AntibioticResis\/statuses\/720915750983061504","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6736015],"posted_on":"2016-04-15T10:04:43+00:00","author":{"name":"AntibioticResistance","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/551766191962746880\/GlO2QteM_normal.jpeg","description":"Keep abreast of the latest developments in the fight against Antibiotic Resistance #AMR with the latest publications curated from PubMed.
