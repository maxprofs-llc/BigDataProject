For each group, the concentration of sevoflurane used for each consecutive patient was increased or decreased using the \"up-and-down\" method based on the success or failure to achieve adequate conditions for intubation in the previous patient. The remifentanil bolus dose was administered 90 s before intubation and after the target sevoflurane concentration was achieved.\nIn groups 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0, the effective concentration in 50% (EC50) of the sevoflurane concentration required to perform successful intubation was 3.0, 2.0, and 1.29 vol% and the effective concentration in 95% was 3.45, 2.91, and 1.89 vol%, respectively. When sevoflurane was administered for the induction, the increase in heart rate (HR) of group 1.0 was the highest among the groups. The highest number of adverse events occurred in group 2.0, including vocal cord rigidity, hypotension, and bradycardia.\nThe EC50 of the sevoflurane concentration was 3.0, 2.0, and 1.29 vol% when it was combined with a bolus dose of remifentanil of 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0\u200a\u03bcg\/kg, respectively. Of the 3 different bolus doses of remifentanil, the dose of 1.5\u200a\u03bcg\/kg was least associated with changes in the HR\/mean blood pressure during intubation without increasing adverse effects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b27","authors":["Eui-Kyoung Goo","Jong Seok Lee","Jae Chul Koh"],"doi":"10.1097\/md.0000000000006235","first_seen_on":"2017-03-26T08:01:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0025-7974"],"issue":"9","journal":"Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1490516259,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28248887?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28248887","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"The optimal exhaled concentration of sevoflurane for intubation without neuromuscular blockade using clinical bolus doses of remifentanil","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/Insights.ovid.com\/crossref?an=00005792-201703030-00038","volume":"96","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/optimal-exhaled-concentration-sevo-fl-urane-intubation-without-neuromuscular-blockade-using-clinical"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":7275601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248165,"mean":13.313636595154,"rank":205628,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248165,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4252,"mean":2.940759350741,"rank":3178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4252,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":297,"mean":1.9705405405405,"rank":173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":297,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/statuses\/845908481039204352","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18147477],"posted_on":"2017-03-26T08:01:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
