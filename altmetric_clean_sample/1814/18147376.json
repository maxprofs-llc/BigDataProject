The LA was divided into septal-anterior wall (SAW), posterior inferior wall (PIW), and mitral isthmus (MI) region, respectively. Ablation strategy was determined based on the endocardial bipolar voltage map. Based on electrophysiological substrates, 10, 17, and 9 cases were classified into iatrogenic, spontaneous, and no-substrate PMAFL, respectively. The mean voltage in SAW was significantly lower in spontaneous PMAFL (iatrogenic: 1.07\u2009\u00b1\u20090.66\u2009mV; spontaneous: 0.65\u2009\u00b1\u20090.44\u2009mV; no-substrate: 1.60\u2009\u00b1\u20090.53\u2009mV, P <0.001), while iatrogenic PMAFL patients had the lowest voltage in MI (0.51\u2009\u00b1\u20090.23\u2009mV vs. 1.55\u2009\u00b1\u20090.78\u2009mV, 1.61\u2009\u00b1\u20090.56\u2009mV, P <0.001). No low-voltage or slow conduction zone was found in the no-substrate PMAFL group. Fifteen spontaneous PMAFLs were successfully terminated by modified septal-anterior (9\/10) or conventional anterior ablation line (6\/7). Eight iatrogenic PMAFLs (8\/10) were terminated by reinforcing the previous ablation areas. Cardioversion without PMAFL ablation was done in no-substrate PMAFL patients. After a median follow-up of 12 (7-39) months, two spontaneous PMAFL patients received redo procedures for recurrence due to \"gap\" conduction.\nThe ablation strategy for PMAFL patients should be based on the arrhythmogenic substrate, but not the indiscriminate MI ablation. No-substrate PMAFLs during AF ablation could be monitored after cardioversion and might not need further ablation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f610007321","authors":["Yu, Jinbo","Chen, Kai","Yang, Bing","Zhang, Fengxiang","Ju, Weizhu","Chen, Hongwu","Yang, Gang","Li, Mingfang","Wang, Benqi","Gu, Kai","Ouyang, Feifan","Ho, Siew Yen","Po, Sunny","Chen, Minglong"],"doi":"10.1093\/europace\/euw431","first_seen_on":"2017-03-26T07:56:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-2092"],"journal":"Europace","last_mentioned_on":1490514967,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28340110?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28340110","pubdate":"2017-03-26T22:01:11+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["physiology","cardiology"],"title":"Peri-mitral atrial flutter: personalized ablation strategy based on arrhythmogenic substrate.","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":7275603,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248165,"mean":13.313640423268,"rank":205629,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248165,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1188,"mean":3.9361651221567,"rank":804,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1188,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":1.864,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CardiologiaF\/statuses\/845907198907637762","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18147376],"posted_on":"2017-03-26T07:56:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Cardiolog\u00eda-Fabumed","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1561758151\/fabumed_normal.png","description":"Cardiolog\u00eda.
