On June 16, 120 environmental samples were collected and analyzed for microbiologic differentiation. Thirteen strains of B cepacia were prominently found in the expiratory blocks of ventilators, revealing the biocontamination source. After chemical disinfection without damaging ventilator components, repeat microbiologic testing of random ventilator samples yielded negative results until July 30, 2015. Retrospective data showed that isolation rates of B cepacia strains had increased since 2014. Although the resistance phenotype of these strains varied slightly, they exhibited similar patterns of antibiotic susceptibility.\nRoutine cleaning and disinfection of ventilators, in addition to an intervention bundle, should form part of an integrated VAP prevention and management approach.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005709","authors":["LiPing Guo","Gang Li","Jian Wang","Xia Zhao","Shupeng Wang","Li Zhai","Hongbin Jia","Bin Cao"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ajic.2017.01.024","first_seen_on":"2017-03-26T08:25:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["01966553","1527-3296"],"journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","last_mentioned_on":1490987012,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28336165?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28336165","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Suspicious outbreak of ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by Burkholderia cepacia in a surgical intensive care unit","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0196655317300871","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/suspicious-outbreak-ventilatorassociated-pneumonia-caused-burkholderia-cepacia-surgical-intensive-ca"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":1.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8440126,"mean":7.0979478654558,"rank":3796706,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4550113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8440126,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248729,"mean":13.319332684699,"rank":110048,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":135139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248729,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2268,"mean":10.466199382444,"rank":1481,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":748,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2268,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":46.229789473684,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":2,"IN":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AntibioticResis\/statuses\/845914617519861760","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18147974],"posted_on":"2017-03-26T08:25:35+00:00","author":{"name":"AntibioticResistance","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/551766191962746880\/GlO2QteM_normal.jpeg","description":"Keep abreast of the latest developments in the fight against Antibiotic Resistance #AMR with the latest publications curated from PubMed.
