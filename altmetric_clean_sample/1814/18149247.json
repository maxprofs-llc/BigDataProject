In present study, CP was successfully modified to obtain its acetylated derivative Ac-CP. Its potential immunomodulatory activities on RAW264.7 macrophages were investigated.\nshowed that the acetylated polysaccharide Ac-CP could significantly stimulate macrophage proliferation, its actions were significantly stronger than that of the corresponding unmodified polysaccharide, CP. Meanwhile, the NO production activities of macrophages were not significantly enhanced by Ac-CP compared to CP group. In addition, both the phagocytic activity and levels of cytokines TNF-a, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 were enhanced in the RAW264.7 macrophages by stimulation of Ac-CP. These results indicated that the acetylated derivative Ac-CP could enhance the activation of peritoneal macrophages, and acetylation modification can enhance the immunomodulation function of CP, indicating the potential application of acetylated polysaccharide as an immunotherapeutic adjuvant.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b27","authors":["Xin Liu","Jianhua Xie","Shuo Jia","Lixin Huang","Zhijun Wang","Chang Li","Mingyong Xie"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijbiomac.2017.02.028","first_seen_on":"2017-03-26T10:07:20+00:00","issns":["01418130"],"journal":"International Journal of Biological Macromolecules","last_mentioned_on":1490522825,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28192134?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28192134","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Immunomodulatory effects of an acetylated Cyclocarya paliurus polysaccharide on murine macrophages RAW264.7","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0141813017301265","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/immunomodulatory-effects-acetylated-cyclocarya-paliurus-polysaccharide-murine-macrophages-raw2647"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":7275606,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248165,"mean":13.313639818829,"rank":205633,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248165,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":986,"mean":1.4168,"rank":573,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":986,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128,"mean":1.3444881889764,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
