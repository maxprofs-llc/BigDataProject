The study included 41 patients undergoing to vertebrae surgery. The patients were randomized into two groups: Group 1 received volume-controlled ventilation, while group 2 received pressure-controlled ventilation. The demographic data, pulmonary mechanics, the inflammatory marker levels just after the induction of anesthetics, at the 6th and 12th hours, and gas analysis from arterial blood samples taken at the beginning and the 30th minute were recorded. The inflammatory marker levels increased in both groups, without any significant difference among groups. Peak inspiratory pressure level was higher in the volume-controlled ventilation group. This study revealed that there is no difference regarding inflammatory marker levels between volume- and pressure-controlled ventilation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ac7","authors":["Hasan \u015eenay","Remziye S\u0131vac\u0131","Serdar Kokulu","Bu\u011fra Koca","Elif Do\u011fan Bak\u0131","Y\u00fcksel Ela"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10753-016-0379-2","first_seen_on":"2017-03-26T07:55:23+00:00","issns":["0360-3997","1573-2576"],"journal":"Inflammation","last_mentioned_on":1490516257,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27221140?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27221140?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27221140","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pathology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology\/Toxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Rheumatology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["pathology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"The Effect of Pressure-Controlled Ventilation and Volume-Controlled Ventilation in Prone Position on Pulmonary Mechanics and Inflammatory Markers","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s10753-016-0379-2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-pressurecontrolled-ventilation-volumecontrolled-ventilation-prone-position-pulmonary-mechanic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":6388567,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1143296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248166,"mean":13.313583954224,"rank":178312,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":42538,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248166,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":473,"mean":1.4905805084746,"rank":189,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":473,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":0.4,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/LungOmics\/statuses\/845906944506314752","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18147322],"posted_on":"2017-03-26T07:55:06+00:00","author":{"name":"LungOmics","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","description":"An automated account posting papers directly from pubmed, based on searches related to the 'omics of respiratory disease.","id_on_source":"LungOmics","tweeter_id":"781005050919391232","geo":{"lt":43.00035,"ln":-75.4999,"country":"US"},"followers":11},"tweet_id":"845906944506314752"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/statuses\/845908960494272512","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18147322],"posted_on":"2017-03-26T08:03:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
