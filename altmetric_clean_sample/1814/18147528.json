However, recurrence events still remain, which may be partly due to inadequate platelet inhibition by standard clopidogrel therapy. Genetic polymorphisms involved in clopidogrel's absorption, metabolism, and the P2Y12 receptor may interfere with its antiplatelet activity. Recent evidence indicated that epigenetic modification may also affect clopidogrel response. In addition, non-genetic factors such as demographics, disease complications, and drug-drug interactions can impair the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel. The identification of factors contributing to the variation in clopidogrel response is needed to improve platelet inhibition and to reduce risk for cardiovascular events. This review encompasses the most recent updates on factors influencing pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses to clopidogrel.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61d3cf058f6100078a4","authors":["Yan-Jiao Zhang","Mu-Peng Li","Jie Tang","Xiao-Ping Chen"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijerph14030301","first_seen_on":"2017-03-26T08:05:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1660-4601"],"issue":"3","journal":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1490537494,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28335443?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28335443?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28335443","pubdate":"2017-03-26T22:12:54+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth","environmentalhealth"],"title":"Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Responses to Clopidogrel: Evidences and Perspectives","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-4601\/14\/3\/301","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic-responses-clopidogrel-evidences-perspectives"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":6388569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1143290,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248165,"mean":13.313614633871,"rank":178318,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":42527,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248165,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3257,"mean":7.8111105651106,"rank":2413,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":432,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3257,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":313,"mean":5.48625,"rank":181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":78,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":313,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
