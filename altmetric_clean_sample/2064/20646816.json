Angiographic morphological patterns were divided into focal or non-focal patterns and stent-edge or stent-body patterns.\nThe proportion of ACS substantially increased in very late TLR lesions (57.1%) from early (40.0%, p=0.01) and late TLR lesions (36.7%, p<0.001). The proportions of both stent-edge and non-focal patterns were higher in very late TLR lesions than in early and late TLR lesions. Although the stent-edge pattern tended to be more prevalent in SCAD lesions than in ACS lesions during the early- and late-term periods, it was more frequently observed in ACS lesions than in SCAD lesions during the very late-term period (65.5% vs. 47.6%, p=0.04). The non-focal pattern was more frequent in ACS lesions than in SCAD lesions during all 3 periods. However, the proportion of the non-focal pattern in ACS lesions was extremely high during the very late-term (90.5%) compared with the early- (47.6%, p<0.001) and late-term periods (48.4%, p<0.001).\nStent-related ACS became more common beyond 5years after SES implantation. Stent-edge and non-focal patterns were the main angiographic morphologies of very late SES failure, particularly causing ACS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b29","authors":["Shunsuke Kubo","Masanobu Ohya","Akimune Kuwayama","Takenobu Shimada","Katsuya Miura","Hidewo Amano","Yusuke Hyodo","Suguru Otsuru","Seiji Habara","Takeshi Tada","Hiroyuki Tanaka","Yasushi Fuku","Tsuyoshi Goto","Kazushige Kadota"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijcard.2017.05.052","first_seen_on":"2017-05-27T16:05:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["01675273","1874-1754"],"journal":"International Journal of Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1495880226,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28545849?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28545849","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Difference in Clinical Presentations and Related Angiographic Findings among Early, Late, and Very Late Sirolimus-Eluting Stent Failure Requiring Target Lesion Revascularization","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/difference-clinical-presentations-related-angiographic-findings-among-early-late-very-late-sirolimus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8276988,"mean":6.9824426364262,"rank":7157767,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8276988,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238713,"mean":12.108027321626,"rank":193793,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238713,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3779,"mean":3.1937797776601,"rank":2543,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3779,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":158,"mean":3.4479617834395,"rank":94,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":158,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
