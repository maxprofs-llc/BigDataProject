Basic vespid neuroanatomy and some aspects of functional neural circuitry are well-characterized, and genomic tools for exploring brain plasticity are being developed. Although relatively modest in terms of species richness, the Vespidae include species spanning much of the known range of animal social complexity, from solitary nesters to highly eusocial species with some of the largest known colonies and multiple reproductives. Eusocial species differ in behavior and ecology including variation in queen\/worker caste differentiation and in diurnal\/nocturnal activity. Species differences in overall brain size are strongly associated with brain allometry; relative sizes of visual processing tissues increase at faster rates than antennal processing tissues. The lower relative size of the central-processing mushroom bodies (MB) in eusocial species compared to solitary relatives suggests sociality may relax demands on individual cognitive abilities. However, queens have greater relative MB volumes than their workers, and MB development is positively associated with social dominance status in some species. Fruitful areas for future investigations of adaptive brain investment in the clade include sampling of key overlooked taxa with diverse social structures, and the analysis of neural correlations with ecological divergence in foraging resources and diel activity patterns.","altmetric_jid":"537f30852a83eeb45a8b4599","authors":["O\u2019Donnell, Sean","Bulova, Susan","Sean O\u2019Donnell","Susan Bulova"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cois.2017.05.014","first_seen_on":"2017-05-27T15:37:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2214-5745","22145745","2214-5753"],"journal":"Current Opinion in Insect Science","last_mentioned_on":1499396314,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S2214574516301729?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S2214574516301729"],"pmid":"28805639","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","title":"Development and evolution of brain allometry in wasps (Vespidae): Size, ecology and sociality","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-evolution-brain-allometry-wasps-vespidae-size-ecology-sociality"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.45,"score_history":{"1y":3.45,"6m":3.45,"3m":3.45,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8172783,"mean":6.915960179526,"rank":1953873,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6208927,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8172783,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229082,"mean":12.128848573212,"rank":70526,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":157986,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229082,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250,"mean":4.2666265060241,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":183,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":9.796,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BehavEcolPapers\/statuses\/868400401380397056","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20645679],"posted_on":"2017-05-27T09:36:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Behav Ecol Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/517345050670268416\/beckzx8T_normal.jpeg","description":"Papers in behavioral ecology #ethology animal #behavior from #PubMed & journal feeds @ASNAmNAT @PLOSBiology @LinneanSociety - literature bot by @MihalyFoldvari","id_on_source":"BehavEcolPapers","tweeter_id":"2797948887","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1166},"tweet_id":"868400401380397056"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BrainEvolutionN\/statuses\/871830098177085443","license":"gnip","rt":["BehavEcolPapers"],"citation_ids":[20645679],"posted_on":"2017-06-05T20:44:27+00:00","author":{"name":"Brain Evolution News","url":"http:\/\/brainevolutionnews.blogspot.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/529247918373351424\/cu8reAsT_normal.jpeg","description":"Brain Evolution in the News tweeted for you! \r\nFor events & opportunities in brain evolution research follow @EurNetBrainEvoR","id_on_source":"BrainEvolutionN","tweeter_id":"404829917","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1050},"tweet_id":"871830098177085443"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Amy_L_Toth\/statuses\/882953278329417728","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20645679],"posted_on":"2017-07-06T13:24:00+00:00","author":{"name":"Amy Lynn Toth","url":"http:\/\/tothlab.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000704441767\/f9474a66a9259d662d2737bc966f065e_normal.jpeg","description":"Studying bees, wasps, behavior, genomics.
