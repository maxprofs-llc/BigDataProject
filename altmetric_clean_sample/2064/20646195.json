The greatest number of children were injured or killed in road traffic crashes on their way from home to kindergarten or school. Mostly due to lack of experience, children's behavior is confusing and often reckless and hasty. Safe behavior in the traffic environment demands certain cognitive skills. Unlike adults, children have less than fully developed peripheral vision. Also, changes occur in color perception, i.e. discrimination. All this leads to the conclusion that the stage of physical and mental development of the child is very important for safe participation in traffic. So, to estimate if they are sufficiently equipped to participate safely in traffic, a sensitive test for young children that may be suitable for their level of cognitive development is required. Accordingly, road safety education should be arranged in such a way that considers the child's level of development, as has been shown to be more effective when started at younger ages. Play is the most natural and easiest way of learning because it is the lens through which children experience their world, and the world of others. Having this in mind, if we want to measure the abilities of a child, and their preparedness for safety participation in traffic, unavoidable is to use non-verbal tests. The purpose of this study is to explore primary schooler's spatial, and abilities of color perception and memorization, as well as their performances in interpreting the meaning of traffic signs. In addition, neighborhood environmental correlates (rural-urban) and possible individual differences influences on the relationship among these abilities was examined. Knowledge about these factors affecting children's safety can be applied to improve relevant intervention measures for promoting safe participation of young children in traffic. It may constitute the basis for effective classroom work which implies the creation of individualized educational plans and programs, through which road safety skills could be acquired and adopted through play.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f61000213e","authors":["Aleksandar Trifunovi\u0107","Dalibor Pe\u0161i\u0107","Svetlana \u010ci\u010devi\u0107","Boris Anti\u0107"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.aap.2017.02.019","first_seen_on":"2017-05-27T15:49:43+00:00","issns":["00014575"],"journal":"Accident Analysis & Prevention","last_mentioned_on":1495879086,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28273551?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28273551","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Transportation And Freight Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Social Sciences","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"title":"The importance of spatial orientation and knowledge of traffic signs for children's traffic safety","type":"article","volume":"102","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/importance-spatial-orientation-knowledge-traffic-signs-childrens-traffic-safety"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8276988,"mean":6.9824426364262,"rank":7157767,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8276988,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238713,"mean":12.108040936358,"rank":193794,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238713,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2556,"mean":5.6845643835616,"rank":1928,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2556,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":9.0422413793103,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
