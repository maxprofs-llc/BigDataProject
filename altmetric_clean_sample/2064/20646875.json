The data about medical comorbidities according to American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, procedural details, and clinical and radiographic outcomes were reviewed.\nA total of 388 procedures were performed under local anesthesia, 198 procedures with UIA were included. The mean age was 63.8 \u00b1 12.5 years and 118 (59.6%) cases had a risk status of ASA class III or IV. Of those 198 procedures, 196 procedures (99.0%) were completed successfully. The overall procedure-related event rate was 5% (10\/198). The rates of morbidity and mortality were 0.5 % (1 of 198) and 0% at 1-month, respectively. There were three recurred cases (1.5%) and two (1%) of them underwent EVT again. The mean of ICU stay was 0.99 \u00b1 0.1 days and the mean of postoperative hospital stay was 3.6 \u00b1 7.2 days.\nLocal anesthesia in the EVT of UIA is feasible and safe. It could be considered as an alternative for the patients with high risk of general anesthesia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d13","authors":["Song, Jihye"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.wneu.2017.05.077","first_seen_on":"2017-05-27T16:05:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1878-8750","1878-8769"],"journal":"World Neurosurgery","last_mentioned_on":1495880344,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28546120?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28546120","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","subjects":["neurosurgery"],"title":"Local Anesthesia for Endovascular Treatment of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms; Feasibility, Safety, and Periprocedural Complications","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/local-anesthesia-endovascular-treatment-unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms-feasibility-safety-peripro"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8276988,"mean":6.9824426364262,"rank":7157767,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8276988,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238714,"mean":12.107984349407,"rank":193794,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238714,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1008,"mean":3.1336524329692,"rank":732,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1008,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107,"mean":1.8842452830189,"rank":77,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/statuses\/868411224702164992","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20646875],"posted_on":"2017-05-27T10:19:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
