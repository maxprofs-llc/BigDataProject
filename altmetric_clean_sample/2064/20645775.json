To assess validity, a subsample of 645 participants completed additional measures of cannabis dependence and problems (Marijuana Smoking History Questionnaire [MSHQ], Timeline Followback [TLFB], Cannabis Abuse Screening Test [CAST], Cannabis Use Disorders Identification Test Revised [CUDIT-R], Cannabis Use Problems Identification Test [CUPIT], and Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test [AUDIT]).\nA six-factor structure was revealed, with factors measuring: daily sessions, frequency, age of onset, marijuana quantity, cannabis concentrate quantity, and edibles quantity. The factors were reliable, with Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranging from .69 (daily sessions) to .95 (frequency). Results further provided evidence for the factors' convergent (MSHQ, TLFB), predictive (CAST, CUDIT-R, CUPIT), and discriminant validity (AUDIT).\nThe DFAQ-CU is the first psychometrically sound inventory for measuring frequency, age of onset, and quantity of cannabis use. It contains pictures of marijuana to facilitate the measurement of quantity of marijuana used, as well as questions to assess the use of different forms of cannabis (e.g., concentrates, edibles), methods of administering cannabis (e.g., joints, hand pipes, vaporizers), and typical THC levels. As such, the DFAQ-CU should help facilitate research on frequency, quantity, and age of onset of cannabis use.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Carrie Cuttler","Alexander Spradlin"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0178194","first_seen_on":"2017-05-27T15:40:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"5","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1503633916,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0178194"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0178194&type=printable","pmid":"28552942","pubdate":"2017-05-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Measuring cannabis consumption: Psychometric properties of the Daily Sessions, Frequency, Age of Onset, and Quantity of Cannabis Use Inventory (DFAQ-CU)","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/measuring-cannabis-consumption-psychometric-properties-daily-sessions-frequency-age-onset-quantity-c"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8425604,"mean":7.0878923279354,"rank":6091061,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2032468,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8425604,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245229,"mean":12.618657233268,"rank":158807,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":72000,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245229,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116140,"mean":10.656368833898,"rank":78954,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":31305,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116140,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4186,"mean":9.8195020310633,"rank":2581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1310,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4186,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Ph.
