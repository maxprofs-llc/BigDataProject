In the discovery phase, a multiple reaction monitoring assay of 90 proteins identified by either gene expression analysis or global serum proteome profiling was established and applied to 182 clinical specimens. Nine proteins (P < 0.05) were selected for the independent validation phase and quantified using stable isotope dilution-multiple reaction monitoring-mass spectrometry in 456 specimens. Of these proteins, four proteins (apolipoprotein A-IV, apolipoprotein CIII, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1) were significantly altered in pancreatic cancer in both the discovery and validation phase (P < 0.01). Moreover, a panel including carbohydrate antigen 19-9, apolipoprotein A-IV and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 showed better performance for distinguishing early pancreatic cancer from pancreatitis (Area under the curve = 0.934, 86% sensitivity at fixed 90% specificity) than carbohydrate antigen 19-9 alone (71% sensitivity).Overall, we present the panel of robust biomarkers for early pancreatic cancer diagnosis through bioinformatics analysis that combined transcriptomic and proteomic data as well as rigorous validation on a large number of independent clinical samples.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Jisook Park","Eunjung Lee","Kyoung-Jin Park","Hyung-Doo Park","Jong-Won Kim","Hye In Woo","Kwang Hyuck Lee","Kyu-Taek Lee","Jong Kyun Lee","Joon-Oh Park","Young Suk Park","JinSeok Heo","Seong Ho Choi","Dong Wook Choi","Kee-Taek Jang","Soo-Youn Lee"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.17463","first_seen_on":"2017-05-27T14:19:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1495916520,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28514751?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28514751","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Large-scale clinical validation of biomarkers for pancreatic cancer using a mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/largescale-clinical-validation-biomarkers-pancreatic-cancer-using-mass-spectrometrybased-proteomics"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":1.6,"6m":1.6,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8276988,"mean":6.9824426364262,"rank":3881018,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4362968,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8276988,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238715,"mean":12.107919384703,"rank":108406,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":128487,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238715,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8810,"mean":3.1377813599728,"rank":1753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":7018,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8810,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1491,"mean":3.0371248322148,"rank":238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":1241,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1491,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
