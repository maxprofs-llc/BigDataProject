Multilevel modeling results indicated that members who perceived more support\/socializing from their GSA, had more LGB friends, were longer serving members, and were in GSAs with more open and respectful climates reported greater engagement. Further, there was a curvilinear association between organizational structure in the GSA and engagement: Perceptions of more structure were associated with greater engagement to a point, after which greater structure was related to less engagement.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fd3cf058f6100060f2","authors":["V.
