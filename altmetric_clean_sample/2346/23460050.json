We reviewed, with which drugs the risk of falls is relevant and might depend on genomic variation. Pharmacogenetic variability may contribute to drug-induced falls for instance mediated by impaired drug elimination due to inherited deficiency in enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6. The relative role of specific genes and polymorphisms in old age may differ from younger people. Biomarkers for frailty, but also genomic biomarkers might help identifying patients at high risk for drug-induced falls. Many other factors including disease and drug-drug interactions also contribute to risk of falls. Further studies analyzing the impact of genomic variation on the medication-related fall risk in the older adult are urgently needed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f6100084da","authors":["Just, Katja Susanne","Schneider, Katharina Luise","Schurig, Marlen","Stingl, Julia Carolin","Brockm\u00f6ller, J\u00fcrgen"],"doi":"10.2217\/pgs-2017-0018","first_seen_on":"2017-08-05T10:01:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1462-2416","1744-8042"],"journal":"Pharmacogenomics","last_mentioned_on":1501927292,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28776468?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28776468","pubdate":"2017-08-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Future Medicine Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical","pharmacology"],"title":"Falls: the adverse drug reaction of the elderly and the impact of pharmacogenetics","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pharmacogenomics-falls-adverse-drug-reaction-elderly-impact-pharmacogenetics"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8324953,"mean":7.0165383958894,"rank":6317397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1127063,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8324953,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174048,"mean":11.969939763397,"rank":123053,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":31547,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174048,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":616,"mean":3.1307447154472,"rank":435,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":90,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":616,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.5807692307692,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/montaneva\/statuses\/893773959027724289","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23460050],"posted_on":"2017-08-05T10:01:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Eva Montan\u00e9","url":"http:\/\/www.evamontane.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/508647741166088192\/-P1-vOGD_normal.jpeg","description":"Clin.Pharmacologist MD, Ph.D. @HGermansTrias & @UABBarcelona.
