However, little is reported on its anti-tumor potential on human lung cancer. Our present study was designed to investigate its effects on human lung squamous carcinoma SK-MES-1 cells. We found that Isoalantolactone induced cellular and DNA morphological changes and decreased the viability of SK-MES-1 cells. It significantly inhibited the growth of SK-MES-1 cells through apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner via activation of p53. It also induced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase. It can down-regulate Bcl-2 and up-regulate Bax, to induce dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential and generation of reactive oxygen species. Caspase-3 was also activated by Isoalantolactone, with the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Our results reveal that Isoalantolactone induces intrinsic apoptosis in SK-MES-1 cells through p53 signaling pathway, which suggests that Isoalantolactone could be a potential leading compound for future development of anti-lung cancer drugs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Jin, Chengyan","Zhang, Guangxin","Zhang, Yifan","Hua, Peiyan","Song, Ge","Sun, Mei","Li, Xin","Tong, Ti","Li, Bingjin","Zhang, Xingyi"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0181731","first_seen_on":"2017-08-05T10:16:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"8","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1501928169,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28777796?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28777796","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science (PLoS)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Isoalantolactone induces intrinsic apoptosis through p53 signaling pathway in human lung squamous carcinoma cells","type":"article","volume":"12"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8324953,"mean":7.0165383958894,"rank":4434994,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2317070,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8324953,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174049,"mean":11.969888800791,"rank":95346,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":61460,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174049,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115052,"mean":10.612703566245,"rank":66824,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":36850,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115052,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2662,"mean":9.9447801578354,"rank":1460,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":1031,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2662,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/genomeguardian\/statuses\/893777640137539584","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23460506],"posted_on":"2017-08-05T10:16:09+00:00","author":{"name":"TP53","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/516935062370000897\/PnU7aavz_normal.jpeg","description":"A twitterbot dedicated to supplying the most recent papers about p53, the Guardian of the Genome.","id_on_source":"genomeguardian","tweeter_id":"2794540623","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":173},"tweet_id":"893777640137539584"}]}}
