However, many inhabitants in areas along the railways have been disturbed by noise and ground vibration from the trains. Additionally, the Shinkansen railway emits a higher level of ground vibration than conventional railways at the same noise level. These findings imply that building vibrations affect living environments as significantly as the associated noise. Therefore, it is imperative to quantify the effects of noise and vibration exposures on each annoyance under simultaneous exposure. We performed a secondary analysis using individual datasets of exposure and community response associated with Shinkansen railway noise and vibration. The data consisted of six socio-acoustic surveys, which were conducted separately over the last 20 years in Japan. Applying a logistic regression analysis to the datasets, we confirmed the combined effects of vibration\/noise exposure on noise\/vibration annoyance. Moreover, we proposed a representative relationship between noise and vibration exposures, and the prevalence of each annoyance associated with the Shinkansen railway.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61d3cf058f6100078a4","authors":["Shigenori Yokoshima","Takashi Morihara","Tetsumi Sato","Takashi Yano"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijerph14080845","first_seen_on":"2017-08-06T04:30:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1660-4601"],"issue":"8","journal":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1501664160,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-4601\/14\/8\/845","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/ijerph14080845"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-4601\/14\/8\/845\/pdf","pmid":"28749452","pubdate":"2017-07-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth","environmentalhealth"],"title":"Combined Effects of High-Speed Railway Noise and Ground Vibrations on Annoyance","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/combined-effects-highspeed-railway-noise-ground-vibrations-annoyance"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8314034,"mean":7.0059620328577,"rank":7188648,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8314034,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":166727,"mean":11.617878087401,"rank":136169,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":166727,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3184,"mean":7.9334665409991,"rank":2741,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3184,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":142,"mean":8.5543262411348,"rank":118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":142,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Combined Effects of High-Speed Railway Noise and Ground Vibrations on Annoyance","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1011100502327073&id=961475810622876","license":"public","citation_ids":[23469412],"posted_on":"2017-08-02T08:56:00+00:00","summary":"High-speed trains may create a combination of both noise and vibration that increase the level of annoyance: http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-4601\/14\/8\/845\n\nMore Silence Less Noise - make a difference - buy the book: https:\/\/www.createspace.com\/7201217","author":{"name":"More Silence Less Noise","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/961475810622876","facebook_wall_name":"More Silence Less Noise","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/961475810622876\/picture","id_on_source":"961475810622876"}}]}}
