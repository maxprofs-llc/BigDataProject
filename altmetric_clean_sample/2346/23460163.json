Updates on the current state of diagnosis and management are included. We conclude with the discussion of outcomes of coinfections and areas where future research can be directed to improve our underlying knowledge in clinical practice regarding viral and bacterial coinfection.\nViral and bacterial coinfections are common in both community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonias. Clinicians must be aware of these entities for appropriate management and prognostication of individual patients, as well as for the prevention of nosocomial spread of viral illness.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f61000706b","authors":["Cawcutt, Kelly","Kalil, Andre C."],"doi":"10.1097\/mcc.0000000000000435","first_seen_on":"2017-08-05T10:04:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1070-5295","1531-7072"],"issue":"5","journal":"Current Opinion in Critical Care","last_mentioned_on":1504208473,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28777158?dopt=Abstract|","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-criticalcare\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Pneumonia_with_bacterial_and_viral_coinfection_.99241.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-criticalcare\/Fulltext\/2017\/10000\/Pneumonia_with_bacterial_and_viral_coinfection.6.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/co-criticalcare\/9000\/00000\/Pneumonia_with_bacterial_and_viral_coinfection_.99241.pdf","pmid":"28777158","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health)","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"385","subjects":["criticalcare"],"title":"Pneumonia with bacterial and viral coinfection","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-criticalcare\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Pneumonia_with_bacterial_and_viral_coinfection_.99241.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pneumonia-bacterial-viral-coinfection"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":2.25,"6m":2.25,"3m":2.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454083,"mean":7.1051250224367,"rank":3572303,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4827557,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454083,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":226090,"mean":12.725096293937,"rank":86377,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":137241,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":226090,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":827,"mean":3.7688426150121,"rank":402,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":415,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":827,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":5.31,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
