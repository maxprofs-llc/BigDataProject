The assessment of inflammation\/coagulation profiles may support therapeutic decisions.\nWe evaluated in a prospective, non-randomized study, the efficacy and safety of switching to ABC\/3TC from ZDV\/3TC or TDF\/FTC backbones, in 40 HIV-1 infected patients with HIV-RNA levels <37 copies\/mL (>24 months). Main endpoints were viral load levels, CD4+ T cells and toxicities after 48 weeks. Serum inflammation\/coagulation markers (ESR, CRP, D-dimer and fibrinogen) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, adiponectin, resistin,) were evaluated.\nBaseline characteristics were similar in the two arms, with significantly lower values of e-GFR in patients on TDF\/FTC. Markers of inflammation\/coagulation and cytokine profile were also similar, except higher values of resistin in patients on TDF\/FTC. During follow up, CD4+ T cells increased and viral load remained undetectable in both groups. Patient from ZDV\/3TC had significantly greater changes in total cholesterol and serum creatinine. Markers of inflammation\/coagulation remained unchanged. Adiponectin significantly increased in patients from ZDV\/3TC.\nSwitching to ABC\/3TC was effective and safe. Inflammatory markers remained low in both groups. Some changes in metabolic, kidney and cytokine profiles were apparently specific for baseline cART treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9153cf058f61000ce51","authors":["Fantauzzi, Alessandra","Floridia, Marco","Falasca, Francesca","Spanedda, Pierpaolo","Turriziani, Ombretta","Vullo, Vincenzo","Mezzaroma, Ivano"],"first_seen_on":"2016-03-12T09:39:15+00:00","issns":["1121-7138"],"issue":"4","journal":"new microbiologica","last_mentioned_on":1457722447,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26485011?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26485011","pubdate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Backbone switch to abacavir\/lamivudine fixed-dose combination: implications for antiretroviral therapy optimization.","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/backbone-switch-abacavirlamivudine-fixeddose-combination-implications-antiretroviral-therapy-optimiz"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7380153,"mean":6.4120828327074,"rank":5581793,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":994851,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7380153,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278103,"mean":10.850883409684,"rank":195462,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":43180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278103,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124,"mean":1.7070406504065,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.7,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
