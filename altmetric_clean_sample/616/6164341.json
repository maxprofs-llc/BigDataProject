Parental consanguinity was found in all the families. In all the patients, hypotonia, weakness, delayed motor milestones, markedly elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) concentration, and brain white matter abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging were detected. Mutation analysis was performed in all the patients, and 3 different mutations were detected. However, a mutation in patient 1 and 2 has not been previously described in the literature.\nWhen a patient presents with severe congenital hypotonia, muscle weakness, high serum CPK levels, and white matter abnormalities, should be suspected as MDC1A.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dd2","authors":["Incecik, Faruk","Herguner, Ozlem M","Ceylaner, Serdar","Altunbasak, Sakir"],"doi":"10.4103\/1817-1745.174432","first_seen_on":"2016-03-12T01:28:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1817-1745"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Pediatric Neurosciences","last_mentioned_on":1457706693,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26962340?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26962340","pubdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"346","title":"Merosin-negative congenital muscular dystrophy: Report of five cases","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/merosinnegative-congenital-muscular-dystrophy-report-five-cases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7380153,"mean":6.4120828327074,"rank":3788389,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2068007,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7380153,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278102,"mean":10.850905706919,"rank":150834,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":98570,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278102,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97,"mean":3.0605208333333,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":3.4216666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NeuroGen_papers\/statuses\/708299327689502721","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6164341],"posted_on":"2016-03-11T14:31:33+00:00","author":{"name":"NeuroGenetics papers","url":"http:\/\/neurogeneticslab.wordpress.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/508573077727223808\/P7-OnZSA_normal.png","description":"Twitterbot from @TheGBLab!
