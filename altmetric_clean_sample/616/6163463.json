We aimed to investigate the effect of RHR on the risk of 5 cardiovascular events: incident myocardial infarction (MI), incident atrial fibrillation (AF), incident ischaemic stroke, total death and cardiovascular death in a general population from Norway.\nWe followed 24\u2005489 men and women from the Troms\u00f8 Study 1994-1995, a population-based cohort study, for 18\u2005years, and analysed the association between RHR and the investigated cardiovascular events. Sex-specific Cox regression with time-dependent covariates was applied with the best-fitting fractional polynomials of RHR.\nAmong men, an independent positive relationship was observed for MI and AF (adjusted HR for AF per 20\u2005bpm increase=1.14; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.27). In women, the corresponding HR for MI was 1.23 (1.09 to 1.40). A J-shaped association was observed for ischaemic stroke in women when compared with a RHR of 70\u2005bpm (HR for 50\u2005bpm=1.31; 0.90 to 1.90; HR for 100\u2005bpm=1.32; 1.04 to 1.69). Total and cardiovascular death showed a strong positive association with RHR in men. In women, the pattern for total death was similar.\nRHR is an independent risk factor for several cardiovascular events. A novel finding is the positive association between RHR and AF in men and the sex difference in association with ischaemic stroke.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8083cf058f61000ba9f","authors":["Ekaterina Sharashova","Tom Wilsgaard","Ellisiv B Mathiesen","Maja-Lisa L\u00f8chen","Inger Nj\u00f8lstad","Tormod Brenn"],"doi":"10.1136\/jech-2015-206663","first_seen_on":"2016-03-11T21:51:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1470-2738","0143-005X"],"issue":"9","journal":"Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (1978)","last_mentioned_on":1495718826,"links":["http:\/\/jech.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/03\/07\/jech-2015-206663.abstract?sid=f82ebc2a-a592-4a66-8a49-7b07bdb1e406&utm_content=bufferf0dee&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/jech.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/03\/07\/jech-2015-206663.abstract?utm_content=buffer2ce64&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/jech.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/03\/07\/jech-2015-206663.abstract","http:\/\/jech.bmj.com\/content\/70\/9\/902.short?rss=1","http:\/\/jech.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/03\/07\/jech-2015-206663","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26951324"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jech.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/03\/07\/jech-2015-206663.full.pdf","pmid":"26951324","pubdate":"2016-03-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Geography","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"jech-2015-206663","subjects":["publichealth","healthservices","epidemiology"],"title":"Resting heart rate predicts incident myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, ischaemic stroke and death in the general population: the Troms\u00f8 Study","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/jech.bmj.com\/lookup\/doi\/10.1136\/jech-2015-206663","volume":"70","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/resting-heart-rate-predicts-incident-myocardial-infarction-atrial-fibrillation-ischaemic-stroke-deat-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.85,"score_history":{"1y":2.85,"6m":2.85,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8266357,"mean":6.977935429341,"rank":1683541,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6573178,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8266357,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283879,"mean":11.147248994286,"rank":72301,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":211119,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283879,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2689,"mean":14.452405505952,"rank":1066,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":1614,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2689,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":44.6004,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
