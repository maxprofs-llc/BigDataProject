In contrast, due to the hostile immunosuppressive microenvironment of a solid tumor, CAR T-cell accessibility and survival continue to pose a considerable challenge, which leads to their limited therapeutic efficacy. In this study, we constructed two anti-MUC1 CAR-T cell lines. One set of CAR-T cells contained SM3 single chain variable fragment (scFv) sequence specifically targeting the MUC1 antigen and co-expressing interleukin (IL) 12 (named SM3-CAR). The other CAR-T cell line carried the SM3 scFv sequence modified to improve its binding to MUC1 antigen (named pSM3-CAR) but did not co-express IL-12. When those two types of CAR-T cells were injected intratumorally into two independent metastatic lesions of the same MUC1(+) seminal vesicle cancer patient as part of an interventional treatment strategy, the initial results indicated no side-effects of the MUC1 targeting CAR-T cell approach, and patient serum cytokines responses were positive. Further evaluation showed that pSM3-CAR effectively caused tumor necrosis, providing new options for improved CAR-T therapy in solid tumors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000896","authors":["You, Fengtao","Jiang, Licui","Zhang, Bozhen","Lu, Qiang","Zhou, Qiao","Liao, Xiaoyang","Wu, Hong","Du, Kaiqi","Zhu, Youcai","Meng, Huimin","Gong, Zhishu","Zong, Yunhui","Huang, Lei","Lu, Man","Tang, Jirong","Li, Yafen","Zhai, Xiaochen","Wang, Xiangling","Ye, Sisi","Chen, Dan","Yuan, Lei","Qi, Lin","Yang, Lin","Fengtao You","Licui Jiang","Bozhen Zhang","Qiang Lu","Qiao Zhou","Xiaoyang Liao","Hong Wu","Kaiqi Du","Youcai Zhu","Huimin Meng","Zhishu Gong","Yunhui Zong","Lei Huang","Man Lu","Jirong Tang","Yafen Li","Xiaochen Zhai","Xiangling Wang","Sisi Ye","Dan Chen","Lei Yuan","Lin Qi","Lin Yang"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11427-016-5024-7","endpage":"397","first_seen_on":"2016-03-11T19:56:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1869-1889"],"issue":"4","journal":"Science China Life Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1469552948,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26961900?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s11427-016-5024-7"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs11427-016-5024-7.pdf","pmid":"26961900","pubdate":"2016-03-11T22:00:59+00:00","publisher":"Science China Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"386","subjects":["science","biology"],"title":"Phase 1 clinical trial demonstrated that MUC1 positive metastatic seminal vesicle cancer can be effectively eradicated by modified Anti-MUC1 chimeric antigen receptor transduced T cells.","type":"article","volume":"59","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phase-1-clinical-trial-demonstrated-muc1-positive-metastatic-seminal-vesicle-cancer-effectively-erad"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8133552,"mean":6.8851399141579,"rank":3836768,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4116186,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8133552,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283042,"mean":11.10917744779,"rank":130423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":142735,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283042,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":346,"mean":2.6928347826087,"rank":109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":223,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":346,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":2.4093043478261,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
