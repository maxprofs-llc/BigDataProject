Nonetheless, their coexistence has never been observed in a single material. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that a non-centrosymmetric perovskite structure of CsPbI$_3$ allows for the simultaneous presence of ferroelectric and topological orders with appropriate strain engineering. Metallic topological surface states create an intrinsic short-circuit condition, helping stabilize bulk polarization. Exploring diverse structural phases of CsPbI$_3$ under pressure, we identify that the key structural feature for achieving a ferroelectric topological insulator is to suppress PbI$_6$ cage rotation in the perovskite structure, which could be obtained via strain engineering. Ferroelectric control over the density of topological surface state provides a new paradigm for device engineering, such as perfect-focusing Veselago lens and spin-selective electron collimator. Our results suggest that CsPbI$_3$ is a simple model system for ferroelectric topological insulators, enabling future studies exploring the interplay between conventional symmetry-breaking and topological orders and their novel applications in electronics and spintronics.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003145","authors":["Shi Liu"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.nanolett.5b04545","endpage":"1668","first_seen_on":"2016-03-12T00:22:56+00:00","issns":["1530-6992","1530-6984"],"issue":"3","journal":"Nano Letters","last_mentioned_on":1457732335,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.nanolett.5b04545?ref=tw&hootPostID=b88e07c165f2a3b04955880202627dca"],"pmid":"26814668","pubdate":"2016-03-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1663","subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Strain-Induced Ferroelectric Topological Insulator","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/straininduced-ferroelectric-topological-insulator"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7380163,"mean":6.412201927,"rank":3164975,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4131529,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7380163,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278102,"mean":10.850933754283,"rank":116295,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":157677,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278102,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3998,"mean":11.899588191143,"rank":2339,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":1605,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3998,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169,"mean":20.913880952381,"rank":88,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":80,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":18,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
