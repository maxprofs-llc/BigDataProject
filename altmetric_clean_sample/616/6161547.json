Pre\/post-implant hemodynamics and angiography were reported. A core laboratory performed standardized review of all angiograms. One-month follow-up was reported.\nA total of 158 patients (male\u00a0= 65%; median age 19 years) underwent placement of CCPS. Eighty-three patients had pre-existing AWI. The average ascending-to-descending aorta systolic gradient improved from 27 \u00b1 20 mm\u00a0Hg to 4 \u00b1 6 mm\u00a0Hg. Complete coverage of pre-existing AWI was achieved in 66 of 71 patients (93%) with AWI who received a single CCPS. Ultimately, complete coverage of AWI was achieved in 76 of 83 patients (92%); 7 patients had minor endoleaks that did not require repeat intervention. Four patients experienced important access site vascular injury. There were no acute AWI, repeat interventions, or deaths.\nThe CCPS can effectively treat and potentially prevent AWI associated with CoA. Access site arterial injury is the most common important complication. Longer-term follow-up is necessary to define mid- and late-term outcomes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007acb","authors":["Taggart, Nathaniel W","Minahan, Matthew","Cabalka, Allison K","Cetta, Frank","Usmani, Kudret","Ringel, Richard E",", ","Nathaniel W.
