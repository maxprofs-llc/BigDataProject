Recently, it was suggested that hypoxia increased the size of the cancer stem-cell (CSC) subpopulations and promoted the acquisition of a CSC-like phenotype. However, candidate hypoxia-regulated mediators specifically relevant to the stemness-related functions of colorectal CSCs have not been examined in detail. In the present study, we showed that hypoxia specifically promoted the self-renewal potential of CSCs. Through various in vitro studies, we found that hypoxia-induced Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin signaling increased the occurrence of CSC-like phenotypes and the level of Id2 expression in colorectal-cancer cells. Importantly, the levels of hypoxia-induced CSC-sphere formation and Id2 expression were successfully attenuated by treatment with a Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin-signaling inhibitor. We further demonstrated, for the first time, that the degree of hypoxia-induced CSC-sphere formation (CD44(+) subpopulation) in vitro and of tumor metastasis\/dissemination in vivo were markedly suppressed by knocking down Id2 expression. Taken together, these data suggested that Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin signaling mediated the hypoxia-induced self-renewal potential of colorectal-cancer CSCs through reactivating Id2 expression.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Hye-Jin Dong","Gyu-Beom Jang","Hwa-Yong Lee","Se-Ra Park","Ji-Young Kim","Jeong-Seok Nam","In-Sun Hong","Dong, Hye-Jin","Jang, Gyu-Beom","Lee, Hwa-Yong","Park, Se-Ra","Kim, Ji-Young","Nam, Jeong-Seok","Hong, In-Sun"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep22966","first_seen_on":"2016-03-11T20:26:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1458606361,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep22966","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26965643?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26965643","pubdate":"2016-03-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cancer stem cells","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"The Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin signaling\/Id2 cascade mediates the effects of hypoxia on the hierarchy of colorectal-cancer stem cells","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/wnt%CE%B2catenin-signalingid2-cascade-mediates-effects-hypoxia-hierarchy-colorectalcancer-stem-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7424901,"mean":6.4566625821178,"rank":1693907,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":5712528,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7424901,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278430,"mean":10.860197378865,"rank":83022,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":194241,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278430,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27769,"mean":14.698576418899,"rank":9370,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":18273,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27769,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3009,"mean":15.588078457447,"rank":1046,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":1947,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3009,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
