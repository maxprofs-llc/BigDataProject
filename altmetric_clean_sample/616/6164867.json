The way flows exit from such sliding modes can lead to complex and interesting behaviour about which little is currently known. Here, we examine the basic mechanisms by which a flow exits from sliding, either along a switching surface or along the intersection of two switching surfaces, with a view to understanding sliding and exit when many switches are involved. On a single switching surface, exit occurs via tangency of the flow to the switching surface. Along an intersection of switches, exit can occur at a tangency with a lower codimension sliding flow, or by a spiralling of the flow that exhibits geometric divergence (infinite steps in finite time). Determinacy-breaking can occur where a singularity creates a set-valued flow in an otherwise deterministic system, and we resolve such dynamics as far as possible by blowing up the switching surface into a switching layer. We show preliminary simulations exploring the role of determinacy-breaking events as organizing centres of local and global dynamics.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024db","authors":["Mike R.
