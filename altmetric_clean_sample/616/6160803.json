Searches were performed up to August 31, 2015, using MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and CENTRAL. Meta-analysis was performed by using comprehensive meta-analysis software. Pooled ORs and 95% CIs were calculated comparing treatment regimens for eradication of H. pylori infection with and without doxycycline.\nThe OR for eradication success rate in a fixed model was in favor for treatment regimens with doxycycline: 1.292, 95% CI 1.048-1.594, p = 0.016. There was no significant heterogeneity in the included studies: Q = 15.130, d.f. (Q) = 8, I2 = 47.126, p > 0.10. When treatment regimens with doxycycline were compared only with treatment regimens with tetracycline, no significant difference was found in eradication success rate: OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.68-1.32, p = 0.77. But when treatment regimens with doxycycline were compared with treatment regimens without tetracycline, the OR in favor of doxycycline was even higher: OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.21-2.09, p < 0.001.\nIn this meta-analysis, we confirmed doxycycline efficiency in the eradication of H. pylori. Thus, triple, quadruple or even high dose dual therapy with regimens containing doxycycline should be considered.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002708","authors":["Niv, Yaron"],"doi":"10.1159\/000443683","endpage":"173","first_seen_on":"2016-03-11T17:09:45+00:00","issns":["1421-9867","0012-2823"],"issue":"2","journal":"Digestion","last_mentioned_on":1457667802,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26849820"],"pmid":"26849820","pubdate":"2016-02-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"167","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Doxycycline in Eradication Therapy of Helicobacter pylori - A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","type":"article","volume":"93","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/doxycycline-eradication-therapy-helicobacter-pyloria-systematic-review-metaanalysis-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7380153,"mean":6.4120828327074,"rank":5581736,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":995066,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7380153,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":277989,"mean":10.830726477402,"rank":195368,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":43231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":277989,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":277,"mean":2.9306376811594,"rank":177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":71,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":277,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.6583333333333,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Mobodick\/statuses\/708136203372130304","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6160803],"posted_on":"2016-03-11T03:43:22+00:00","author":{"name":"Moborichard","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2488605067\/image_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"Mobodick","tweeter_id":"71635111","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":3},"tweet_id":"708136203372130304"}]}}
