Stuttering results in depression, anxiety, behavioral problem, social isolation and communication problems in daily life. Our objective was to determine the effect of Aerobic Exercises (AE) on stuttering.\nA quasi trail was conducted at National Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine (NIRM) from January to June 2015. Thirty patients were selected and placed in three different groups Experimental Group A, (EG = 10 patients, age between 7-14 years), Experimental Group B (EG =10 patients age between 15-28 years) and control group -group C, (CG = 10 patients, age between 7-28 years). Patient who stutter were included in this study and those with any other pathology or comorbidity of speech disorders were excluded. The assessment tool used was Real-Time analysis of speech fluency scale. Participants in all the groups received speech therapy while only the EG - A and B received aerobic exercises (AE) using treadmill and stationary bicycle along with the speech therapy. Pre-interventional and post interventional assessments were analyzed using the SPSS 21 in order to determine the significance of new treatment approach and the effectiveness of physical therapy on speech disorders.\nAll the groups showed significant treatment effects but both the EG groups (Group A, Group B) showed high improvement in the severity level of stuttering as compared to control group C. The results also showed that AE treated group B had significant difference in p-value (p=0.027) as compared to control group (p<0.05) while experimental group A had no significant difference (p > 0.05) between these groups.\nThe eclectic approach of aerobic exercises with the traditional speech therapy provides proximal rehabilitation of stuttering.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5303cf058f610004385","authors":["Illays Khan","Irum Nawaz","Imran Amjad"],"doi":"10.12669\/pjms.324.9351","first_seen_on":"2016-09-23T04:43:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1682-024X","1681-715X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Pakistan Journal of Medical Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1501545600,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5017068\/","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.12669\/pjms.324.9351"],"pmid":"27648057","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Professional Medical Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1005","title":"EFFECT OF AEROBIC EXERCISES ON STUTTERING","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-aerobic-exercises-stuttering"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8302353,"mean":6.9982161057411,"rank":4178337,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3911451,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8302353,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252682,"mean":12.633619409452,"rank":129362,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":113980,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252682,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257,"mean":1.734109375,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":184,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
