Participants completed internationally validated questionnaires assessing stigmatising attitudes, knowledge about depression and confidence in dealing with suicidal persons pre- and post-training.\nThere were significant differences among countries in terms of previous exposure to suicidal persons and extent of previous training. Post-training evaluation demonstrated significant improvements in stigmatising attitudes, knowledge and confidence in all three countries.\nThe consistently positive effects of gatekeeper training of police officers across different regions support inclusion of this type of training as a fundamental part of multi-level community-based suicide prevention programmes and roll-out, nationally and internationally.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ba2","authors":["Ella Arensman","Claire Coffey","Eve Griffin","Chantal Van Audenhove","Gert Scheerder","Ricardo Gusmao","Susana Costa","Celine Larkin","Nicole Koburger","Margaret Maxwell","Fiona Harris","Vita Postuvan","Ulrich Hegerl","Arensman, Ella","Coffey, Claire","Griffin, Eve","Van Audenhove, Chantal","Scheerder, Gert","Gusmao, Ricardo","Costa, Susana","Larkin, Celine","Koburger, Nicole","Maxwell, Margaret","Harris, Fiona","Postuvan, Vita","Hegerl, Ulrich","E.
