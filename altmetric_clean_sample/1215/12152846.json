We included HIV-infected children aged <16 years at cART initiation from 1996 onward. We used Cox models to calculate hazard ratios (HRs), adjusted for region and origin, sex, cART start year, age, and HIV\/AIDS stage at cART initiation.\n\u2003We included 24 991 children from eastern Africa, southern Africa, Europe and Asia; 26 developed KS after starting cART. Incidence rates per 100 000 person-years (PYs) were 86 in eastern Africa (95% confidence interval [CI], 55-133), 11 in southern Africa (95% CI, 4-35), and 81 (95% CI, 26-252) in children of sub-Saharan African (SSA) origin in Europe. The KS incidence rates were 0\/100 000 PYs in children of non-SSA origin in Europe (95% CI, 0-50) and in Asia (95% CI, 0-27). KS risk was lower in girls than in boys (adjusted HR [aHR], 0.3; 95% CI, .1-.9) and increased with age (10-15 vs 0-4 years; aHR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.2-10.1) and advanced HIV\/AIDS stage (CDC stage C vs A\/B; aHR, 2.4; 95% CI, .8-7.3) at cART initiation.\n\u2003HIV-infected children from SSA but not those from other regions, have a high risk of developing KS after cART initiation. Early cART initiation in these children might reduce KS risk.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000255e","authors":["The Pediatric AIDS-Defining Cancer Project Working Group for IeDEA Southern Africa, TApHOD, and COHERE in EuroCoord","Eliane Rohner","Kurt Schmidlin","Marcel Zwahlen","Rana Chakraborty","Gary Clifford","Niels Obel","Sophie Grabar","Annelies Verbon","Antoni Noguera-Julian","Ali Judd","Intira Jeannie Collins","Pablo Rojo","Norbert Brockmeyer","Maria Campbell","Genevi\u00e8ve Ch\u00eane","Hans Prozesky","Brian Eley","D Cristina Stefan","Alan Davidson","Cleophas Chimbetete","Shobna Sawry","Mary-Ann Davies","Azar Kariminia","Ung Vibol","Annette Sohn","Matthias Egger","Julia Bohlius","Frank Tanser","Michael Vinikoor","Eusebio Macete","Robin Wood","Kathryn Stinson","Daniela Garone","Geoffrey Fatti","Sam Phiri","Janet Giddy","Kennedy Malisita","Christiane Fritz","Michael Hobbins","Kamelia Kamenova","Matthew Fox","Karl Technau","Robert Zangerle","Giota Touloumi","Josiane Warszawski","Laurence Meyer","Fran\u00e7ois Dabis","Murielle Mary Krause","Jade Ghosn","Catherine Leport","Linda Wittkop","Peter Reiss","Ferdinand Wit","Maria Prins","Heiner Bucher","Caroline Sabin","Diana Gibb","Gerd F\u00e4tkenheuer","Julia Del Amo","Claire Thorne","Amanda Mocroft","Ole Kirk","Christoph Stephan","Santiago P\u00e9rez-Hoyos","Osamah Hamouda","Barbara Bartmeyer","Nikoloz Chkhartishvili","Andrea Antinori","Antonella d\u2032Arminio Monforte","Luis Prieto","Antoni Soriano-Arandes","Manuel Battegay","Roger Kouyos","Cristina Mussini","Pat Tookey","Jordi Casabona","Jose M.
