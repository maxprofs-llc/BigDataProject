All patients underwent the multi-tier stratified diagnostic protocol for complete evaluation of short stature. Coeliac disease was screened using IgA-anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody. The diagnosis of coeliac disease was made on the basis of the modified European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) criteria.\nOf 432 patients (238 boys) who presented with short stature, 72 (16.7%) had physiological, while 360 (83.3%) had pathological causes. Endocrine causes were growth hormone deficiency (86 patients, 19.9%), hypopituitarism (31, 7.2%), hypothyroidism (22, 5.1%) and others (7, 1.6%). The systemic causes were: coeliac disease (47, 10.9%), haematological diseases (14, 3.2%), renal diseases (11, 2.5%) and others (24, 5.6%). Chronic diarrhoea (OR 15.7, 95% CI 7.8-31.5) and anaemia (OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.9-12.7]) were significant predictors for coeliac disease in patients with short stature. There was a definite response to gluten-free diet in them and the mean (SD) growth velocity measured over at least 6 months of gluten-free diet was 8.1 (3.0) cm\/year.\nNearly 11% of patients presenting with short stature have coeliac disease. In these patients chronic diarrhoea and anaemia were significant predictors of coeliac disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9173cf058f61000d177","authors":["Singh, Prashant","Sharma, Piyush Kumar","Agnihotri, Abhishek","Makharia, Govind K","Jyotsna, Viveka P","Khadgawat, Rajesh","DAS, Prasenjit","Gupta, Siddhartha Datta"],"first_seen_on":"2016-09-23T10:16:11+00:00","issns":["0970-258X"],"issue":"4","journal":"National medical journal of India","last_mentioned_on":1474112160,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27132724"],"pmid":"27132724","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Coeliac disease in patients with short stature: A tertiary care centre experience.","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/coeliac-disease-patients-short-stature-tertiary-care-centre-experience-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8392157,"mean":7.0686031077041,"rank":7254174,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8392157,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253517,"mean":12.6683165244,"rank":209426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253517,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114,"mean":1.6743716814159,"rank":74,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":5.95,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Coeliac disease in patients with short stature: A tertiary care centre experience. - PubMed - NCBI","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=761815930624843&id=280166708789770","license":"public","citation_ids":[12155374],"posted_on":"2016-09-17T11:36:00+00:00","summary":"Coeliakie \u00e9\u00e9n van de oorzaken van een kort postuur\n \nIn deze studie uit India wordt onderzocht waarom 432 kinderen niet goed groeien en een kort postuur hebben.
