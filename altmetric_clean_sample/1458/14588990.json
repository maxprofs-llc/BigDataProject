Several HM1 alleles were generated and cloned by transposon-induced mutagenesis. The sequence of wild-type HM1 shares homology with dihydroflavonol-4-reductase genes from maize, petunia, and snap-dragon. Sequence homology is greatest in the beta alpha beta-dinucleotide binding fold that is conserved among NADPH- and NADH (reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)-dependent reductases and dehydrogenases. This indicates that HM1 encodes HCTR.","ads_id":"1992Sci...258..985J","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["GS Johal","SP Briggs"],"doi":"10.1126\/science.1359642","endpage":"987","first_seen_on":"2016-12-09T04:20:29+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["0036-8075","1095-9203"],"issue":"5084","journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":946684800,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1126\/science.1359642"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/sci\/258\/5084\/985.full.pdf","pmid":"1359642","pubdate":"1992-11-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"985","subjects":["science"],"title":"Reductase activity encoded by the HM1 disease resistance gene in maize","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/cgi\/doi\/10.1126\/science.1359642","volume":"258","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reductase-activity-encoded-hm1-disease-resistance-gene-maize"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6721512,"mean":6.1591958819955,"rank":1563730,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4482894,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6721512,"percentile":66},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103430,"mean":10.853229771148,"rank":30927,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":71382,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103430,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35810,"mean":30.392865815856,"rank":20374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":9114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35810,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":532,"mean":65.747604519774,"rank":309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":189,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":532,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
