The BAG5 antiserum was used in an immunohistochemical procedure to look for reactive epitopes in bradyzoites and tachyzoites of T. gondii within animal tissues. Encysted bradyzoites in brain were stained deeply and diffusely. Although most unencysted organisms in brain were not stained, occasional free organisms had mild to deep staining. There was no staining of tachyzoites in liver where cysts were not observed. Neospora caninum organisms within animal tissues were also examined using the BAG5 immunohistochemical procedure. The BAG5 antiserum cross-reacted with N. caninum bradyzoites but had no affinity for tachyzoites.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dc2","authors":["Milton M. McAllister","Stephen F.
