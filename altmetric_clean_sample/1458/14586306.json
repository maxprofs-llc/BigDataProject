We examined the possibility that cimetidine might also inhibit the cytochrome P450-dependent biotransformation of endogenous compounds such as steroid hormones. Utilizing a radiometric assay and normal male volunteers, the acute effect of intravenous cimetidine (300 mg loading dose followed by 50 mg\/hr) was determined. The extent of 2-hydroxylation of estradiol was reduced by 25% from 29.6 +\/- 4.4% (mean +\/- SEM) before, to 22.9 +\/- 4.0% during cimetidine infusion (n = 8; p less than 0.0005). Following oral cimetidine (800 mg b.i.d.) for 2 wk, estradiol 2-hydroxylation was decreased by 40% from 31.7 +\/- 2.3% to 19.7 +\/- 2.4% (n = 9; p less than 0.0001) but 16 alpha-hydroxylation of estradiol was unaffected. Concomitantly, the urinary excretion of 2-hydroxyestrone was decreased by 25% (p less than 0.002) and the serum estradiol concentration was increased by 20% (p less than 0.04). In contrast, ranitidine, a second generation H2 receptor antagonist, had no effect on estradiol hydroxylation following 150 mg b.i.d. for 2 wk. The inhibition of estradiol 2-hydroxylation and the increase in serum estradiol concentrations caused by cimetidine administration may help to account for the symptoms of hyperestrogenization reported in long-term cimetidine therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9183cf058f61000d23c","authors":["Galbraith, R A","Michnovicz, J J"],"first_seen_on":"2016-12-09T03:16:54+00:00","issns":["0066-9458"],"journal":"Transactions of the Association of American Physicians","last_mentioned_on":1481248353,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2638529"],"pmid":"2638529","pubdate":"1989-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"The oxidative metabolism of estradiol: inhibition by cimetidine.","type":"article","volume":"102"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8122022,"mean":6.8852755184873,"rank":4305006,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2250577,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8122022,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":264431,"mean":12.241685996293,"rank":146399,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":92315,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":264431,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":3.3518709677419,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Fara_Era\/statuses\/807040205123440640","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[14586306],"posted_on":"2016-12-09T01:52:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Fara Nova","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/798359768318562304\/eBg31uT__normal.jpg","description":"Parent to two girls, spouse to a beautiful lady.
