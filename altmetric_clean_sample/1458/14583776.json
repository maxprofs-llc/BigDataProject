Starting from the highest resolution X-ray structure available, we conduct a 306 ns molecular dynamics simulation of the (A-state) wild-type (wt) green fluorescent protein (GFP) to study how its PWs change with time. We find that the PW from the chromophore via Ser205 to Glu222, observed in all X-ray structures, undergoes rapid water molecule insertion between Ser205 and Glu222. Sometimes, an alternate Ser205-bypassing PW exists. Side chain rotations of Thr203 and Ser205 play an important role in shaping the PW network in the chromophore region. Thr203, with its bulkier side chain, exhibits slower transitions between its three rotameric states. Ser205 experiences more frequent rotations, slowing down when the Thr203 methyl group is close by. The combined states of both residues affect the PW probabilities. A random walk search for PWs from the chromophore reveals several exit points to the bulk, one being a direct water wire (WW) from the chromophore to the bulk. A longer WW connects the \"bottom\" of the GFP barrel with a \"water pool\" (WP1) situated below Glu222. These two WWs were not observed in X-ray structures of wt-GFP, but their analogues have been reported in related fluorescent proteins. Surprisingly, the high-resolution X-ray structure utilized herein shows that Glu222 is protonated at low temperatures. At higher temperatures, we suggest ion pairing between anionic Glu222 and a proton hosted in WP1. Upon photoexcitation, these two recombine, while a second proton dissociates from the chromophore and either exits the protein using the short WW or migrates along the GFP-barrel axis on the long WW. This mechanism reconciles the conflicting experimental and theoretical data on proton motion within GFP.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bcd","authors":["Ai Shinobu"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jctc.6b00939","first_seen_on":"2016-12-09T01:51:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1549-9618","1549-9626"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation","last_mentioned_on":1481282999,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jctc.6b00939"],"pmid":"28068768","pubdate":"2016-12-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Theoretical And Computational Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Computer Science"],"title":"Proton Wire Dynamics in the Green Fluorescent Protein","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/proton-wire-dynamics-green-fluorescent-protein"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7866440,"mean":6.6628832942016,"rank":4121706,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2192872,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7866440,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251504,"mean":12.286885476515,"rank":138889,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":88886,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251504,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3185,"mean":1.5117814070352,"rank":1070,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":1790,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3185,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113,"mean":2.4692857142857,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
