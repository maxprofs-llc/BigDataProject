Many anesthesiologists, however, use insensitive, qualitative neuromuscular monitoring or unreliable, clinical tests. Goal of this multicentre, prospective, double-blinded, assessor controlled study was to develop an algorithm of muscle function tests to identify PORC.\nAfter extubation a blinded anesthetist performed eight clinical tests in 165 patients. Test results were correlated to calibrated electromyography train-of-four (TOF) ratio and to a postoperatively applied uncalibrated acceleromyography. A classification and regression tree (CART) was calculated developing the algorithm to identify PORC. This was validated against uncalibrated acceleromyography and tactile judgement of TOF fading in separate 100 patients.\nAfter eliminating three tests with poor correlation, a model with four tests (r\u00a0=\u00a00.844) and uncalibrated acceleromyography (r\u00a0=\u00a00.873) were correlated to electromyographical TOF-values without losing quality of prediction. CART analysis showed that three consecutively performed tests (arm lift, head lift and swallowing or eye opening) can predict electromyographical TOF. Prediction coefficients reveal an advantage of the uncalibrated acceleromyography in terms of specificity to identify the EMG measured train-of-four ratio\u00a0<\u00a00.7 (100% vs. 42.9%) and <0.9 (89.7% vs. 34.5%) compared to the algorithm. However, due to the high sensitivity of the algorithm (100% vs. 94.4%), the risk to overlook an awake patient with a train-of-four ratio\u00a0<\u00a00.7 was minimal. Tactile judgement of TOF fading showed poorest sensitivity and specifity at train of four ratio\u00a0<\u00a00.9 (33.7%, 0%) and <0.7 (18.8%, 16.7%).\nResidual neuromuscular blockade can be detected by uncalibrated acceleromyography and if not available by a pathway of four clinical muscle function tests in awake patients. The algorithm has a discriminative power comparable to uncalibrated AMG within TOF-values >0.7 and <0.3.\nClinical Trials.gov (principal investigator's name: CU, and identifier: NCT03219138) on July 8, 2017.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007a7","authors":["Christoph Unterbuchner","Manfred Blobner","Friedrich P\u00fchringer","Matthias Janda","Sebastian Bischoff","Berthold Bein","Annette Schmidt","Kurt Ulm","Viktor Pithamitsis","Heidrun Fink"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12871-017-0393-4","first_seen_on":"2017-08-07T08:30:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1471-2253"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Anesthesiology","last_mentioned_on":1504214511,"links":["https:\/\/bmcanesthesiol.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12871-017-0393-4?platform=hootsuite","https:\/\/bmcanesthesiol.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12871-017-0393-4"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/bmcanesthesiol.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12871-017-0393-4?site=bmcanesthesiol.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"28778151","pubdate":"2017-08-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"101","title":"Development of an algorithm using clinical tests to avoid post-operative residual neuromuscular block","type":"article","volume":"17"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":2.35,"6m":2.35,"3m":2.35,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454083,"mean":7.1051250224367,"rank":3526215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4881822,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454083,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":225254,"mean":12.680868277004,"rank":83743,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":139523,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":225254,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":538,"mean":2.9176163873371,"rank":113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":422,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":538,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":2.7833333333333,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IT":2,"US":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ProfAnestesista\/statuses\/894475726736547840","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23485451],"posted_on":"2017-08-07T08:30:06+00:00","author":{"name":"ATI14","url":"http:\/\/www.ati14.it\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/840213860871217152\/uIcs3iQc_normal.jpg","description":"#AggiornamentoProfessionale per #Anestesisti -
