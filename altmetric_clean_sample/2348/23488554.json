The new metabolic product was found to be non-toxic in all the cell growth experiments performed. The absence of cytotoxicity could be explained by the observation that the metabolite was not recognized as a substrate by thymidine phosphorilase, the enzyme responsible for 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) release from doxifluridine, as ascertained by high-performance liquid chromatography\/ultraviolet (HPLC-UV) analysis of the incubation mixture. The biomethylation process leading to N3-Me-5'-dFUR could be considered as a possible detoxification pathway, altering the drug bioavailability, in competition with 5'-dFUR cleavage to the active 5-FU.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002eb7","authors":["Zambonin, C G","Aresta, A","Grano, M"],"first_seen_on":"2017-08-07T12:05:16+00:00","issns":["0731-7085"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Pharmaceutical & Biomedical Analysis","last_mentioned_on":1502098802,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9608421"],"pmid":"9608421","pubdate":"1998-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pharmacology","biochemistry"],"title":"In vitro toxicity of N3-methyl-5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine, a novel metabolite of doxifluridine: a bioanalytical investigation.","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vitro-toxicity-n3methyl5deoxy5fluorouridine-novel-metabolite-doxifluridine-bioanalytical-investigati"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336644,"mean":7.0294968595789,"rank":4442575,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2320390,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336644,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175778,"mean":12.094284394432,"rank":96179,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":62222,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175778,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":952,"mean":2.004054679285,"rank":385,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":428,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":952,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":1.2802941176471,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
