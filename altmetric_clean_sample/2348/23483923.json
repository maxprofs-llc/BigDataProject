To avoid artifacts this motion needs to be estimated and compensated during image reconstruction. In previous work we showed that Fourier Consistency Conditions (FCC) can be used in fan-beam CT to estimate motion in the sinogram domain. This work extends the FCC to 3-D cone-beam CT. We derive an efficient cost function to compensate for 3-D motion using 2-D detector translations. &#13; &#13; The extended FCC method have been tested with five translational motion patterns, using a challenging numerical phantom. We evaluated the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) and the structural-similarity-index (SSIM) between motion corrected and motion-free reconstructions. Additionally, we computed the mean-absolute-difference (MAD) between the estimated and the ground-truth motion. The practical applicability of the method is demonstrated by application to respiratory motion estimation in rotational angiography, but also to motion correction for weight-bearing imaging of knees. Where the latter makes use of specifically modified FCC version which is robust to axial truncation.&#13; &#13; The results show a great reduction of motion artifacts. Accurate estimation results were achieved with a maximum MAD value of 708\u03bcm and 1184\u03bcm for motion along the vertical and horizontal detector direction, respectively. The image quality of reconstructions obtained with the proposed method is close to that of motion corrected reconstructions based on the ground-truth motion. Simulations using noise-free and noisy data demonstrate that FCC are robust to noise. Even high-frequency motion was accurately estimated leading to a considerable reduction of streaking artifacts. The method is purely image-based and therefore independent of any auxiliary data.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000330e","authors":["Martin Berger","Yan Xia","Wolfgang Aichinger","Katrin Mentl","Mathias Unberath","Andre Aichert","Christian Riess","Joachim Hornegger","Rebecca Fahrig","Andreas Konrad Maier","Martin Berger","Yan Xia","Wolfgang Aichinger","Katrin Mentl","Mathias Unberath","Andre Aichert","Christian Riess","Joachim Hornegger","Rebecca Fahrig","Andreas Konrad Maier"],"doi":"10.1088\/1361-6560\/aa8129","first_seen_on":"2017-08-07T06:54:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0031-9155","1361-6560"],"journal":"Physics in Medicine & Biology","last_mentioned_on":1506706897,"links":["https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1088\/1361-6560\/aa8129"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/article\/10.1088\/1361-6560\/aa8129\/pdf","pmid":"28741597","pubdate":"2017-07-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"IOP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["biophysics","biology"],"title":"Motion compensation for cone-beam CT using Fourier consistency conditions","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/motion-compensation-conebeam-ct-using-fourier-consistency-conditions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":2,"3m":2,"1m":2,"1w":2,"6d":2,"5d":2,"4d":2,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462498,"mean":7.1083922572655,"rank":3681794,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4658879,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462498,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":226464,"mean":12.690882590092,"rank":91339,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":131105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":226464,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1391,"mean":2.2122244604317,"rank":399,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":971,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1391,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":1.9193548387097,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Materials Science":1,"Physics and Astronomy":1,"Computer Science":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ipemnews\/statuses\/913720256845303809","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23483923],"posted_on":"2017-09-29T11:00:59+00:00","author":{"name":"IPEM","url":"http:\/\/www.ipem.ac.uk","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1583081605\/IPEM_logotop_normal.jpg","description":"The Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine: Improving Treatments, Saving Lives","id_on_source":"ipemnews","tweeter_id":"388796279","geo":{"lt":54.75844,"ln":-2.69531,"country":"GB"},"followers":3088},"tweet_id":"913720256845303809"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PMB_medphysweb\/statuses\/913737798561288198","license":"gnip","rt":["ipemnews"],"citation_ids":[23483923],"posted_on":"2017-09-29T12:10:42+00:00","author":{"name":"PMB","url":"http:\/\/iopscience.org\/pmb","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1417036902\/PMB_73x73_V1_normal.gif","description":"PMB is the leading international journal of biomedical physics, published on behalf of IPEM; medicalphysicsweb brings you all the latest medical physics news.","id_on_source":"PMB_medphysweb","tweeter_id":"318359978","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2457},"tweet_id":"913737798561288198"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/robMedPhysics\/statuses\/913821076773392384","license":"gnip","rt":["ipemnews"],"citation_ids":[23483923],"posted_on":"2017-09-29T17:41:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Robert Farley","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/615203538164142080\/saA1-aUd_normal.jpg","description":"Head of Medical Physics.
