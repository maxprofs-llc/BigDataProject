V-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) inhibitors targeted at BRAF gene have obviously clinical efficacy to specific advantages populations with little side-effect, and be well tolerated. It is discovered recently that drug resistance also exists in BRAF inhibitors like other targeted drugs, the mechanism of drug resistance is being studied. In this paper, a review were performed in the mechanism, clinical application, adverse reactions and the drug resistance of BRAF inhibitors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa67a3cf058f610009778","authors":["Kang, Xiaoyan","Zhu, Nan","Song, Xia"],"doi":"10.3779\/j.issn.1009-3419.2016.10.13","first_seen_on":"2016-10-28T17:30:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1999-6187"],"issue":"10","journal":"Chinese Journal of Lung Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1477595249,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27760604"],"pmid":"27760604","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"[Progress in the Treatment of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer with BRAF Inhibitors].","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/progress-treatment-nonsmall-cell-lung-cancer-braf-inhibitors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7601780,"mean":6.5482482934541,"rank":6582328,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7601780,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235074,"mean":12.68649861107,"rank":191545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235074,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":142,"mean":0.58297872340426,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":142,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}}},"posts":{"reddit":[{"title":"[Progress in the Treatment of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer with BRAF Inhibitors].","url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nsclc\/comments\/59pucg\/progress_in_the_treatment_of_nonsmall_cell_lung\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[13104126],"posted_on":"2016-10-27T19:07:29+00:00","author":{"name":"montaukwhaler","url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nsclc","id_on_source":"nsclc","followers":1,"subreddit":"non small cell lung cancer"}}]}}
