Thirty-seven institutionalized elders (84.05\u2009\u00b1\u20095.58 years) clinically diagnosed with AD (mild and moderate stages) were divided into two groups: Experimental Group (EG, n\u2009=\u200919) and Control Group (CG, n\u2009=\u200918). The EG participated in a six-month supervised MT program (aerobic, muscular resistance, flexibility and postural exercises) of 45-55 minutes\/session, twice\/week. Cognitive function (MMSE), physical fitness (Senior Fitness Test) and anthropometric variables (Body Mass Index and Waist Circumference), were assessed before (M1), after three months (M2) and after six months (M3) of the experimental protocol. A two-way ANOVA, with repeated measures, revealed significant group and time interactions on cognitive function, chair stand, arm curl, 2-min step, 8-foot up-and-go (UG), chair sit-and-reach (CSR) and back scratch tests as well as waist circumference. Accordingly, for those variables a different response in each group was evident over the time, supported by a significantly better EG performance in chair stand, arm curl, 2-min step, UG, CSR and back scratch tests from M1 to M3, and a significant increase in MMSE from M1 to M2. The CG's performance decreased over time (M1 to M3) in chair stand, arm curl, 2-min step, UG, CSR, back scratch and MMSE. Results suggest that MT programs may be an important non-pharmacological strategy to improve physical and cognitive functions in institutionalized AD patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa59e3cf058f610005251","authors":["Sampaio, Arnaldina","Marques, Elisa A","Mota, Jorge","Carvalho, Joana"],"doi":"10.1177\/1471301216674558","first_seen_on":"2016-10-28T17:22:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1741-2684","1471-3012"],"journal":"Dementia (14713012)","last_mentioned_on":1477674916,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27756836"],"pmid":"27756836","pubdate":"2016-10-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Arts and Humanities"],"title":"Effects of a multicomponent exercise program in institutionalized elders with Alzheimers disease","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-multicomponent-exercise-program-institutionalized-elders-alzheimers-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7607694,"mean":6.5509374902442,"rank":1044121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6496219,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7607694,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235245,"mean":12.683586233868,"rank":50171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":181700,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235245,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":515,"mean":7.6061789883269,"rank":167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":335,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":515,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":8.0375,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":5,"Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
