However, immunotherapy has made breakthroughs in treating squamous NSCLC. Immunotherapy includes two main broad classes of immune checkpoint inhibitors and therapeutic vaccines. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, including anti cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and anti programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) antibodies, have been tested in the phase II\/III clinical trials and have demonstrated promising outcomes. Immunotherapy will become an important treatment for squamous NSCLC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa67a3cf058f610009778","authors":["Wang, Shouzheng","Li, Junling"],"doi":"10.3779\/j.issn.1009-3419.2016.10.09","first_seen_on":"2016-10-28T17:30:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1999-6187"],"issue":"10","journal":"Chinese Journal of Lung Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1477595481,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27760599"],"pmid":"27760599","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"[Progress in Immunotherapy for Squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer].","type":"article","volume":"19"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7601780,"mean":6.5482482934541,"rank":6582327,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7601780,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235074,"mean":12.686495420571,"rank":191545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235074,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":142,"mean":0.58297872340426,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":142,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"reddit":[{"title":"[Progress in Immunotherapy for Squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer].","url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nsclc\/comments\/59pv5l\/progress_in_immunotherapy_for_squamous_nonsmall\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[13104114],"posted_on":"2016-10-27T19:11:21+00:00","author":{"name":"montaukwhaler","url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nsclc","id_on_source":"nsclc","followers":1,"subreddit":"non small cell lung cancer"}}]}}
