In normal tissue, STn is not detectable which is critical for opportunities in develop-ing cancer immunotherapies. A novel, entirely carbohydrate, semi-synthetic STn-PS A1 conjugate was prepared and eval-uated in C57BL\/6 mice. STn-PS A1 was combined with commercially available monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL)-based ad-juvant and after immunization, ELISA indicated a strong immune response for inducing both anti-STn IgM\/IgG antibod-ies. The specificity of these antibodies was concomitantly investigated using FACS analysis and the results indicated ex-cellent cell surface binding events to STn-expressing cancer cell lines MCF-7 and OVCAR-5. An INF-\u03b3 ELISpot assay was conducted to further confirm a robust cellular immunity invoked by STn-PS A1. Most importantly, the raised antibodies conferred complement-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against MCF-7 and OVCAR-5 cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Mengchao Shi"],"doi":"10.1021\/jacs.6b05675","first_seen_on":"2016-10-28T17:06:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-5126","0002-7863"],"issue":"43","journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1477683720,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jacs.6b05675"],"pmid":"27726393","pubdate":"2016-10-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Sialyl-Tn Polysaccharide A1 as an Entirely Carbohydrate Immunogen: Synthesis and Immunological Evaluation","type":"article","volume":"138","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sialyltn-polysaccharide-a1-entirely-carbohydrate-immunogen-synthesis-immunological-evaluation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7607694,"mean":6.5509374902442,"rank":3714080,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3700709,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7607694,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235245,"mean":12.683564766795,"rank":119255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":107664,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235245,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18166,"mean":5.0409881640518,"rank":11714,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":6002,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18166,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":442,"mean":7.0554013605442,"rank":252,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":172,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":442,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
