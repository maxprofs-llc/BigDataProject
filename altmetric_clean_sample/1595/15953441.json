Low socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with higher risk for MetSyn in Hispanics\/Latinos, and psychosocial factors may play a role in this relationship.\nThis cross-sectional study examined psychosocial factors in the association of SES and MetSyn components in 4,996 Hispanic\/Latino adults from the Hispanic Community Health Study\/Study of Latinos (HCHS\/SOL) Sociocultural Ancillary Study.\nMetSyn components were measured at the baseline examination. Participants completed interviews to determine psychosocial risks (e.g., depression) and resources (e.g., social support) within 9 months of baseline (< 4 months in 72.6% of participants). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used to identify latent constructs and examine associations.\nParticipant mean age was 41.7 years (SE = 0.4) and 62.7% were female. CFA identified single latent factors for SES and psychosocial indicators, and three factors for MetSyn [blood pressure, lipids, metabolic factors]. SEMs showed that lower SES was related to MetSyn factors indirectly through higher psychosocial risk\/lower resources (Y-B\u03c7(2) (df = 420) = 4412.90, p < .05, RMSEA = .042, SRMR = .051). A statistically significant effect consistent with mediation was found from lower SES to higher metabolic risk (glucose\/waist circumference) via psychosocial risk\/resource variables (Mackinnon's 95% asymmetric CI = -0.13 to -0.02).\nSES is related to metabolic variables indirectly through psychosocial factors in U.S. Hispanics\/Latinos of diverse ancestries.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002270","authors":["Jessica L.
