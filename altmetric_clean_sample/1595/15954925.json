Blood parameters returned to normal following heminephrectomy. The hydronephrosis had been caused by stenois of the pyeloureteric junction.\nAlthough erythropoietin values may be normal, hydronephrosis can cause secondary erythrocytosis.","altmetric_jid":"56a768e02a83eeb12a8b48e3","authors":["Valero Puerta, J A","Jim\u00e9nez Gonzalo, F J","Medina P\u00e9rez, M","Valpuesta Fern\u00e1ndez, I","S\u00e1nchez Gonz\u00e1lez, M","L\u00f3pez Rodr\u00edguez, L"],"first_seen_on":"2017-01-30T22:52:30+00:00","issns":["0004-0614"],"issue":"8","journal":"Archivos Espa\u00f1oles de Urolog\u00eda (Ed. impresa)","last_mentioned_on":1485792420,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10589125"],"pmid":"10589125","pubdate":"1999-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"[Erythrocytosis and hydronephrosis in a horseshoe kidney].","type":"article","volume":"52"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.208,"score_history":{"1y":6.208,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.208},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8154803,"mean":6.8922645386048,"rank":1304947,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":6849659,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8154803,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262671,"mean":12.80992048578,"rank":63884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":198787,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262671,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":1.7167931034483,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":55,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Polycythemia and a Horseshoe kidney","url":"http:\/\/www.pbfluids.com\/2017\/01\/polycythemia-and-horseshoe-kidney.html","license":"public","citation_ids":[15954925,3747378],"posted_on":"2017-01-30T16:07:00+00:00","summary":"This is a reported complication.Nice review of polycythemia, with full text:&nbsp;Current applications of therapeutic phlebotomyMention of this complication in a textbook of hematology.Patients with Horseshoe Kidneys have increased risk of renal cell carci","author":{"name":"Precious Bodily Fluids","url":"http:\/\/www.pbfluids.com\/","description":"Musings of a Salt Whisperer"}}]}}
