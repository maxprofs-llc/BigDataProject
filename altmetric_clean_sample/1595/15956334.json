The more recently introduced biologicals are a class of drugs that constantly increases, and as such, the spectrum of GI tract side effects is steadily growing. This review covers not only long-known GI tract side effects of drugs but also those more recently described. A comprehensive but concise list of medications used in daily practice and associated with GI tract injury is presented.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008c7f","authors":["Michael Vieth","Elizabeth Montgomery"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00428-017-2077-3","first_seen_on":"2017-01-31T00:52:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0945-6317","1432-2307"],"journal":"Virchows Archiv","last_mentioned_on":1485823929,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00428-017-2077-3"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00428-017-2077-3.pdf","pmid":"28133700","pubdate":"2017-01-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pathology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","pathology","cellbiology"],"title":"Medication-associated gastrointestinal tract injury","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s00428-017-2077-3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/medicationassociated-gastrointestinal-tract-injury"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8156965,"mean":6.8933631772734,"rank":4330504,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2257982,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8156965,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262600,"mean":12.836871199052,"rank":149732,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":86925,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262600,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":710,"mean":2.5063695345557,"rank":336,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":289,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":710,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.3133333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Design":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"NL":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/pathowitter\/statuses\/826231559921479681","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15956334],"posted_on":"2017-01-31T00:52:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Pathowitter","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/788085326866706432\/1gzBh3hy_normal.jpg","description":"Pathology-related tweets (some emphasis on neuropath \/ hemetopath) | Mostly a relay account of GNU Social: https:\/\/quitter.se\/pathowitter","id_on_source":"pathowitter","tweeter_id":"788082462819774464","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":715},"tweet_id":"826231559921479681"}]}}
