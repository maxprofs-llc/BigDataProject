Altered crosstalk among components of this \"triangle of death\", beyond altering redox homeostasis of the neuron, is exacerbated by increased levels of oxidative stress that impair key components of the pathways involved. Redox proteomics studies in human samples and animal models of AD led to the identification of oxidatively modified components of the pathways composing the \"triangle of death\", therefore, revealing the crucial role of oxidative stress in fueling this aberrant vicious cycle.\nRestoration of the functions of the pathways targeted by oxidative damage might represent a promising therapeutic approach to slow onset or delay progression of AD in the aged population.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022ba","authors":["Di Domenico, Fabio","Barone, Eugenio","Perluigi, Marzia","Butterfield, D Allan","Di DomenicoFabio","BaroneEugenio","PerluigiMarzia","ButterfieldD.
