The aim of this study was to assess the impact of PMM on early haemodynamic status after AVR using vasoactive-inotropic dependency index (VDI), postoperative pressures and end-organ perfusion.\nA total of 183 patients with AS were included in this prospective cohort study, and underwent elective AVR with or without combined coronary artery bypass graft surgery. PPM was defined as a projected indexed effective orifice area of \u22640.85 cm(2)\/m(2), and was present in 27.9% of the patients. The primary end-point was the VDI [VDI = vasoactive-inotropic score\/mean arterial pressure] measured upon admission to the intensive care unit (POD0) and on the morning of the first postoperative day (POD1). The secondary end-points were the following: mean left atrial pressure, mean central venous pressure, fluid balance, brain natriuretic peptide, troponin I, glomerular filtration rate and lactate levels on POD0 and POD1.\nNo significant differences in VDI were observed between the no PPM and PPM groups on POD0 (0.08 \u00b1 0.48 vs 0.05 \u00b1 0.13, respectively, P = 0.622) or on POD1 (0.09 \u00b1 0.40 vs 0.06 \u00b1 0.13, respectively; P = 0.583). The mean arterial pressure, mean left atrial pressure, central venous pressure, troponin I, glomerular filtration rate and lactate levels did not differ between the two groups on POD0 and POD1, as well as fluid balance and brain natriuretic peptide on POD1.\nPPM is not associated with early haemodynamic status impairment and end-organ perfusion after AVR.\nClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00699673.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f6100077be","authors":["Kindo, Michel","Minh, Tam Hoang","Perrier, St\u00e9phanie","Petit-Eisenmann, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne","Bentz, Jonathan","Cristinar, Mircea","Ajob, Gharib","Collange, Olivier","Mazzucotelli, Jean-Philippe"],"doi":"10.1093\/icvts\/ivw303","first_seen_on":"2016-09-15T12:31:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1569-9285","1569-9293"],"journal":"Interactive Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1473942425,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27624355?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27624355","pubdate":"2016-09-13T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"ivw303","subjects":["generalsurgery","cardiology","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Impact of prosthesis\u2013patient mismatch on early haemodynamic status after aortic valve replacement","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-prosthesispatient-mismatch-early-haemodynamic-status-after-aortic-valve-replacement"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8386076,"mean":7.0651873001299,"rank":7249263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8386076,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251910,"mean":12.450306785386,"rank":208826,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251910,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1301,"mean":1.6677,"rank":911,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1301,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":0.76904761904762,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
