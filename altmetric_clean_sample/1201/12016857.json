Dissipation of excreted antimicrobials in seasonally frozen agricultural soils has not been fully characterized under field conditions. This study investigated the field dissipation kinetics of chlortetracycline, sulfamethazine, and tylosin over a 10-mo period after fall application of manure from cattle () administered 44 mg chlortetracycline (chlortetracycline treatment [CTC]), 44 mg each of chlortetracycline and sulfamethazine (CTCSMZ), or 11 mg tylosin per kg feed daily. Antimicrobial concentrations in manured soil reflected the same relative concentrations in manure: chlortetracycline > sulfamethazine > tylosin. The first-order dissipation half-life (DT) for chlortetracycline from the CTCSMZ treatment was 77 d during the growing season and 648 d during the nongrowing season when the soil was frozen for an extended period. By comparison, dissipation of chlortetracycline added alone (treatment CTC) did not differ significantly between the two seasons (mean DT, 121 d). During the nongrowing season, chlortetracycline from CTC dissipated faster ( = 0.004) than that from the CTCSMZ treatment, indicating that the presence of sulfamethazine may have altered the dissipation of chlortetracycline. Dissipation kinetics for sulfamethazine and tylosin were not determined due to low detection in the manure-amended soil. Sulfamethazine was detected (up to 16 \u00b1 10 \u00b5g kg) throughout the 10-mo monitoring period. Tylosin concentration was \u226411 \u00b1 6.6 \u00b5g kg and gradually dissipated. Chlortetracycline was detectable 10 mo after application in the seasonally frozen soil, indicating a risk for residue build-up in the soil and subsequent offsite contamination.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5723cf058f610004c90","authors":["Amarakoon,\u00a0Inoka D.","Surac,\u00a0Srinivas","Zvomuya,\u00a0Francis","Cessna,\u00a0Allan J.","Larney,\u00a0Francis J.","McAllister,\u00a0Tim A."],"doi":"10.2134\/jeq2016.01.0012","first_seen_on":"2016-09-15T13:53:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0047-2425"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Environmental Quality","last_mentioned_on":1473975343,"links":["https:\/\/dl.sciencesocieties.org\/publications\/jeq\/articles\/45\/5\/1644"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/dl.sciencesocieties.org\/publications\/jeq\/pdfs\/45\/5\/1644","pmid":"27695746","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Earth Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1644","subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Dissipation of Antimicrobials in a Seasonally Frozen Soil after Beef Cattle Manure Application","type":"article","volume":"45","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dissipation-antimicrobials-seasonally-frozen-soil-after-beef-cattle-manure-application"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8386076,"mean":7.0651873001299,"rank":4167170,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":4154741,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8386076,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251911,"mean":12.44999853916,"rank":125393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":124148,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251911,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1274,"mean":4.5374375490966,"rank":887,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":349,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1274,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":2.0564516129032,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
