However,\u00a0false positive findings from the\u00a0PET\/CT imaging should be taken into consideration as they mislead physicians into improper therapeutic actions. We present a 48-year-old female patient with a history of left colectomy for colorectal cancer and subsequent liver metastasectomy. After one year of follow-up, she presented with a highly suspicious lesion in the liver, which was confirmed on PET\/CT as a metastatic liver tumor. Consequently, the patient underwent surgical excision of the tumor, and the definitive histological diagnosis showed a granulomatous tissue with giant cells and foreign body tissue reaction. Based on this report, we briefly review the dangerous\u00a0pitfalls from\u00a0radiological and PET\/CT imaging concerning the preoperative diagnostic workup examination, as they may significantly alter the treatment plan in oncologic patients.","authors":["Pantiora, Eirini V","Kontis, Elissaios A","Michalaki, Vasiliki","Primetis, Elias","Vezakis, Antonios","Polydorou, Andreas","Fragulidis, Georgios P"],"doi":"10.7759\/cureus.717","first_seen_on":"2016-09-15T10:12:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2168-8184"],"issue":"8","journal":"Cure\u0304us","last_mentioned_on":1473934335,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27625903?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27625903?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27625903","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Granuloma Mimicking Local Recurrence on PET\/CT after Liver Resection of Colorectal Liver Metastasis: A Case Report","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/granuloma-mimicking-local-recurrence-petct-after-liver-resection-colorectal-liver-metastasis-case-re"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
