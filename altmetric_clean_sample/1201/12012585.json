However, in recent years particularly, some urologists advocate same-session bilateral URSL on the ground of success rates and minimal morbidity. This systematic review is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of same-session bilateral ureteroscopy for the treatment of ureteral calculi.\nWe conducted a bibliographic search using MEDLINE(1980 to August 2015), EMBASE(1980 to August 2015). Review papers, and abstract data and were excluded and only English language studies reporting on outcomes of bilateral URSL were included in this meta-analysis. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of each included studies and extracted data. STATA 12.0 was used for meta-analysis.\nIn 11 studies, 431 patients were reportedly treated with bilateral URSL. Most of the stone size were not larger than 20 mm. the mean stone free rate is 96% for the distal ureter, 85% for the middle ureter and 72% for the proximal ureter. The mean operative time ranging from 45 to 100 min with the hospital say of 2 - 4 days. The overall complications rates were 17%, with the incidence of postoperative fever 4%, postoperative pain 20%, and gross hematuria 4%. Other complications included urosepsis, urinary tract infection(UTI), small mucosal laceration, stone migration and ureteral perforation were accounting for a ratio of 6%.\nBilateral same-session ureteroscopy could achieve a high overall stone free rate, the complication rate seemed to be high, but most of the complications are minor. For selected cases, bilateral URSL is safe and effective.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d7a","authors":["Ge, Hongwei","Zheng, Xiaoqing","Hou, Xinzhi","Ding, Wenting","Na, Yanqun","Wang, Yuyong","Yu, Zhijian","GeHongwei","ZhengXiaoqing","NaYanqun","HouXinzhi","YuChengfan","DingWenting","WangYuyong","YuZhijian","HeHuadong"],"doi":"10.1089\/end.2016.0472","first_seen_on":"2016-09-15T10:14:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1557-900X","0892-7790"],"journal":"Journal of Endourology","last_mentioned_on":1477823405,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27626367?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1089\/end.2016.0472"],"pmid":"27626367","pubdate":"2016-09-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":" Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.  140 Huguenot Street, 3rd Floor New Rochelle, NY 10801 USA  ","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Bilateral same-session ureteroscopy for treatment of ureteral calculi: A systematic review and meta-analysis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bilateral-samesession-ureteroscopy-treatment-ureteral-calculi-systematic-review-metaanalysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7621460,"mean":6.5607387299425,"rank":6597524,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7621460,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243567,"mean":12.173615110483,"rank":205450,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243567,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":614,"mean":2.2680032626427,"rank":542,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":614,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":2.1529411764706,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
