The ubiquitous activation of Ca2+ signaling upon phospholipase C (PLC)-coupled receptor ligation leads quite naturally to the assumption that Ca2+ signaling is required for receptor-regulated endothelial barrier function. This widespread hypothesis draws analogy from smooth muscle and proposes the requirement of G protein coupled receptor (GPCR)-generated Ca2+ signaling in activating the endothelial contractile apparatus and generating inter-endothelial gaps. Notwithstanding endothelia being non-excitable in nature, the hypothesis of Ca2+-induced endothelial contraction has been invoked to explain actions of GPCR agonists that either disrupt or stabilize endothelial barrier function. Here, we challenge this correlative hypothesis by showing lack of causal link between GPCR-generated Ca2+ signaling and changes in human microvascular endothelial barrier function. We used three endogenous GPCR agonists; thrombin and histamine which disrupt endothelial barrier function; and Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) which stabilizes barrier function. The qualitatively different effects of these three agonists on endothelial barrier function occur independently of Ca2+ entry through the ubiquitous store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) channel Orai1, global Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane and Ca2+ release from internal stores. However, disruption of endothelial barrier function by thrombin and histamine requires the Ca2+ sensor STIM1, while S1P-mdiated enhancement of endothelial barrier function occurs independently of STIM1. We conclude that while STIM1 is required for GPCR-mediated disruption of barrier function, a causal link between GPCR-induced cytoplasmic Ca2+ increases and acute changes in barrier function is missing. Thus, the cytosolic Ca2+-induced endothelial contraction is a cum hoc fallacy that should be abandoned.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Stolwijk, Judith A","Zhang, Xuexin","Gueguinou, Maxime","Zhang, Wei","Matrougui, Khalid","Renken, Christian","Trebak, Mohamed"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m116.756114","first_seen_on":"2016-09-15T10:24:15+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["1083-351X","0021-9258"],"issue":"44","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1473939955,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27624938?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27624938"],"pmid":"27624938","pubdate":"2016-09-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"jbc.M116.756114","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Calcium Signaling is Dispensable for Receptor-Regulation of Endothelial Barrier Function","type":"article","volume":"291","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/calcium-signaling-dispensable-receptor-regulation-endothelial-barrier-function"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8386076,"mean":7.0651873001299,"rank":4476060,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2333867,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8386076,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251910,"mean":12.45033417623,"rank":138648,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":88878,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251910,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31267,"mean":3.2826201624768,"rank":22170,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":4866,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31267,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":384,"mean":4.4346161879896,"rank":234,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":126,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":384,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
