Methods for testing compliance to a gluten-free diet are costly and cumbersome. Thus, a simple biomarker of gluten intake is needed in a clinical setting and will be useful for epidemiologic studies investigating wider effects of gluten intake.\nThe aim was to evaluate plasma total alkylresorcinol concentrations as a measure of gluten intake.\nIn this randomized, controlled, crossover intervention study in 52 Danish adults with features of the metabolic syndrome, we compared 8 wk of a gluten-rich and gluten-poor diet separated by a washout period of \u22656 wk. We measured fasting plasma concentrations of alkylresorcinols to determine if they reflected differences in gluten intake as a secondary outcome of the original study. In addition, we investigated in 118 Danish adults the cross-sectional association between self-reported gluten intake and plasma alkylresorcinols in the same and a similar study at baseline. We used mixed-model ANCOVA for examining treatment effects, a classification tree to determine compliance to the gluten-poor diet, and linear regression models for examining baseline correlation between plasma alkylresorcinol concentrations and gluten intake.\nPlasma total alkylresorcinols decreased more during the gluten-poor period (geometric mean: -124.8 nmol\/L; 95% CI: -156.5, -93.0 nmol\/L) than in the gluten-rich period (geometric mean: -31.8 nmol\/L; 95% CI: -63.1, -0.4 nmol\/L) (P < 0.001). On the basis of the plasma alkylresorcinol profile, we built a classification tree to objectively determine compliance and found an overall participant misclassification error of 3.9%. In the cross-sectional study we found a 5.6% (95% CI: 2.4%, 8.9%) increase in plasma total alkylresorcinols per 1-g increase in reported gluten intake (P < 0.001).\nWe propose the use of plasma alkylresorcinols to monitor compliance to a gluten-free diet as well as to help investigations into the possible effects of gluten in the wider population. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT017119913 and NCT01731366.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e8d","authors":["Mads V Lind","Mia L Madsen","J\u00fcri J Rumessen","Henrik Vestergaard","Rikke J G\u00f8bel","Torben Hansen","Lotte Lauritzen","Oluf B Pedersen","Mette Kristensen","Alastair B Ross","Lind, Mads V","Madsen, Mia L","Rumessen, J\u00fcri J","Vestergaard, Henrik","G\u00f8bel, Rikke J","Hansen, Torben","Lauritzen, Lotte","Pedersen, Oluf B","Kristensen, Mette","Ross, Alastair B"],"doi":"10.3945\/jn.116.236398","endpage":"1998","first_seen_on":"2016-09-15T07:30:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1541-6100","0022-3166"],"issue":"10","journal":"Journal of Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1478020135,"links":["http:\/\/jn.nutrition.org\/content\/early\/2016\/09\/13\/jn.116.236398.abstract?papetoc","http:\/\/jn.nutrition.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/146\/10\/1991?rss=1","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27629576","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3945\/jn.116.236398"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jn.nutrition.org\/content\/early\/2016\/09\/13\/jn.116.236398.full.pdf","pmid":"27629576","pubdate":"2016-09-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"1991","subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Plasma Alkylresorcinols Reflect Gluten Intake and Distinguish between Gluten-Rich and Gluten-Poor Diets in a Population at Risk of Metabolic Syndrome","type":"article","volume":"146","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/plasma-alkylresorcinols-reflect-gluten-intake-distinguish-between-glutenrich-glutenpoor-diets-popula"},"altmetric_score":{"score":66.25,"score_history":{"1y":66.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":66.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7628277,"mean":6.5635637575213,"rank":115476,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":7512726,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7628277,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243666,"mean":12.172470285022,"rank":8563,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":235098,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243666,"percentile":96},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3744,"mean":12.874862409832,"rank":143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":3601,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3744,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104,"mean":29.414873786408,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":96,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
