Patients in group 1 (n = 76) were immunized with 1 mg KLH intracutaneously, after which they received bladder instillations of 30 mg (30 ml) KLH weekly for 6 weeks and then monthly for 1 year. Patients in group 2 (n = 85) received weekly bladder instillations of 0.565 g etoglucid (50 ml 1% solution) for 6 weeks and then monthly for 1 year. The percentage of recurrences, recurrence rate, disease-free interval and tumor progression rate were evaluated for both treatment groups. The end-point of the study was progression in stage or grade or more than two recurrences during the observation period. The shortest follow-up was 12 months, the mean follow-up, 27.5 months. No statistically significant differences were found between the two groups in percentage of recurrences (43.4% KLH-53.9% etoglucid), recurrence rate (4.4 KLH-3.9 etoglucid), mean disease-free interval (12.1 months KLH-13.6 months etoglucid) or progression rate (6.5% KLH-9.4% etoglucid).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008c3f","authors":["J Flamm","G Donner","A Bucher","W H\u00f6ltl","W Albrecht","L Havelec"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T15:50:30+00:00","issns":["0340-2592"],"issue":"2","journal":"Der Urologe A","last_mentioned_on":1228243232,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8178408"],"pmid":"8178408","pubdate":"1994-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"[Topical immunotherapy (KLH) vs. chemotherapy (Ethoglucid) in prevention of recurrence of superficial bladder cancer.
