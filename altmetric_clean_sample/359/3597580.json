This technology is an intracellular application of gene-engineered antibodies, aimed at ablating the abnormal function of intracellular molecules. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease with no cure. Recent studies have explored possible intrabody applications against alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn), whose misfolding is believed to cause a familial form of PD. Here, we review the origin, production, and therapeutic mechanisms of intrabodies and the potential of intrabody protection against alpha-syn toxicity. Furthermore, we propose possible intrabody applications against leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), whose mutations are the most frequent known cause of familial and sporadic PD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c38","authors":["Zhou C","Przedborski S"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbadis.2008.09.001","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T15:22:57+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"7","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA)","last_mentioned_on":1271837913,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.bbadis.2008.09.001","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18834937","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2745095"],"pmid":"18834937","pubdate":"2009-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Intrabody and Parkinson\u2019s disease","type":"article","volume":"1792","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intrabody-parkinsons-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4038486,"mean":5.0586036109142,"rank":931055,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2550013,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4038486,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":129103,"mean":9.1880048953542,"rank":39611,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":87694,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":129103,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4194,"mean":2.3805280228953,"rank":305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":1729,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4194,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115,"mean":1.1612280701754,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
