The sum of C released into solution plus C released into the gas phase over a 32-day fermentation period was used to determine average daily rates of lignin biodegradation. Cyathus pallidus. C. africanus, and C. berkeleyanus delignified kenaf most rapidly. C. canna showed the greatest preference for lignin degradation over other plant components, and its rate of lignin degradation was only slightly lower than the three most active species. The apparent ability of fungi to metabolize low-molecular-weight lignin breakdown products correlated well with their overall delignification rates. C. stercoreus metabolized degradation products of lignin from wheat straw better than those from kenaf lignin, based on the amount of low-molecular-weight products left in solution.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022c6","authors":["T P Abbott","D T Wicklow"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T14:53:54+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0099-2240"],"issue":"3","journal":"Applied & Environmental Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1272794620,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16346497","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC239724"],"pmcid":"PMC239724","pmid":"16346497","pubdate":"1984-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Degradation of Lignin by Cyathus Species","type":"article","volume":"47","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/degradation-lignin-cyathus-species"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630565,"mean":4.929464153233,"rank":816171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2291874,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630565,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95632,"mean":8.2434836820699,"rank":24928,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69618,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95632,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3361,"mean":3.684444047619,"rank":640,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":2041,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3361,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":2.3925,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":71,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
