(Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 37:222-228, 1987). However, recent data from DNA-DNA hybridization experiments, whole-cell-derived polypeptide patterns determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and data from phenotypic testing have demonstrated that Streptococcus anginosus strains represent three readily identifiable taxa to which the previously assigned type strains of Streptococcus constellatus (strain NCDO 2226 [= ATCC 27823], Streptococcus intermedius (strain NCDO 2227 [= ATCC 27335], and Streptococcus anginosus (strain NCTC 10713 [= ATCC 33397] have been shown to belong. Therefore, we propose recognition of Streptococcus constellatus (emend.) (type strain NCDO 2226 [= ATCC 27823]), Streptococcus intermedius (emend.) (type strain NCDO 2227 [= ATCC 27335]), and Streptococcus anginosus (emend.) (type strain NCTC 10713 [= ATCC 33397]) as distinct species and propose an emended description of each of these taxa.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079fc","authors":["ROBERT A.
