The efficacy of this compound was assessed in rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the medial forebrain bundle, a standard rat model of Parkinson's disease. Dinapsoline produced robust contralateral rotation after either subcutaneous or oral administration. This rotational behavior was attenuated markedly by the D1 receptor antagonist SCH-23390, but not by the D2 receptor antagonist raclopride. During a chronic 14-day treatment period in which rats received dinapsoline either once or twice a day, dinapsoline did not produce tolerance (in fact, some sensitization of the rotational response was observed in one experiment). Because dinapsoline shows less D1:D2 selectivity in vitro than other D1 agonists, the contribution of D2 activity to tolerance was assessed. Chronic daily cotreatment with dinapsoline and raclopride did not enable the development of tolerance to chronic dinapsoline treatment. In contrast, when dinapsoline was administered by osmotic minipump, rapid tolerance was observed. To explore further the contribution of D1 and D2 receptors to tolerance, experiments were performed with the selective D1 agonist A-77636. Daily dosing with A-77636 rapidly produced complete tolerance, as previously observed, whereas coadministration of the D2 agonist quinpirole plus A-77636 failed to either delay or prevent tolerance. Taken together, these results indicate that the development of tolerance to D1 receptor agonists is influenced by the pattern of drug exposure but not by the D1:D2 selectivity of the agonist.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007de2","authors":["A G Gulwadi","C D Korpinen","R B Mailman","D E Nichols","S Y Sit","M T Taber"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T16:13:52+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0022-3565"],"issue":"2","journal":"The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1248250638,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11160615"],"pmid":"11160615","pubdate":"2001-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Dinapsoline: characterization of a D1 dopamine receptor agonist in a rat model of Parkinson's disease.","type":"article","volume":"296","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dinapsoline-characterization-d1-dopamine-receptor-agonist-rat-model-parkinsons-disease-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629816,"mean":4.9321920670937,"rank":816274,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290827,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629816,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95440,"mean":8.2317709112629,"rank":24837,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69521,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95440,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1522,"mean":2.8394148586456,"rank":200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":667,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1522,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":1.7016129032258,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Dinapsoline","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=303496201#altmetric_citation_0","license":"public","citation_ids":[3599530],"posted_on":"2009-07-22T08:17:18+00:00","summary":"Dinapsoline is a drug developed for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, that acts as a selective full agonist at the dopamine D1 receptor.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=23699526","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Meodipt","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Meodipt"}}]}}
