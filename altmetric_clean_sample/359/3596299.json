Hepatic hemangiomas are congenital vascular malformations and are the most common benign tumours of the liver. Most cases are asymptomatic. Although they seldom rupture, it is important to diagnose them as their global mortality rate is high. An accurate diagnosis of a hemangioma as cause of a hemoperitoneum would result in correct clinical decision making and treatment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9223cf058f61000d942","authors":["De Beul P","Roels P","Heirwegh G","Janssen A","Claikens B"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T14:58:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":[],"issue":"5","journal":"JBR BTR organe de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 royale belge de radiologie SRBR orgaan van de Koninklijke Belgische Vereniging voor Radiologie KBVR","last_mentioned_on":1423830934,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25597208?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25597208","pubdate":"2015-01-21T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["radiology"],"title":"Spontaneous rupture: a rare complication of hepatic hemangiomas.","type":"article","volume":"97","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/spontaneous-rupture-rare-complication-hepatic-hemangiomas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4755858,"mean":5.7089565439016,"rank":2525398,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1584023,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4755858,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170955,"mean":8.826912327293,"rank":90748,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":59129,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170955,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":0.92125925925926,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.64285714285714,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/status\/566214096324812800","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3596299],"posted_on":"2015-02-13T12:35:34+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":371},"tweet_id":"566214096324812800"}]}}
