We investigated the potential for web-based DAs in a rehabilitation population. Two self-administered DAs focused on the treatment of acquired ankle-foot impairment in stroke and the treatment of arm-hand function in cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). Data collection comprised a telephone interview and a self-reported paper questionnaire. Of the patients who agreed to participate, 39 stroke patients (44%) and 38 patients with SCI (78%) returned a questionnaire. More than 75% of patients expressed a need for more information about the treatment of disease-related impairment. The DAs were highly appreciated by both patient groups. Nearly all patients expressed a positive attitude towards the use of the web-based DAs in general practice. The DAs had a positive effect on the knowledge about the treatment alternatives in the stroke patients (P = 0.001), although not in the patients with SCI. The DAs reduced patients' conflict about treatment (P < 0.05). The effect of the DAs on patients' desired role in decision-making was limited. Web-based aids are feasible in the rehabilitation population with access to a computer and can improve the knowledge gaps in patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f50","authors":["Janine A van Til","Constance H C Drossaert","Gerbert J Renzenbrink","Govert J Snoek","Evelien Dijkstra","Anne M Stiggelbout","Maarten J IJzerman"],"doi":"10.1258\/jtt.2009.001012","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T15:25:39+00:00","issns":["1758-1109"],"journal":"Journal of Telemedicine & Telecare","last_mentioned_on":1497725236,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1258\/jtt.2009.001012"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jtt.sagepub.com\/content\/16\/1\/48.full.pdf","pmid":"20086268","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information Systems","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["healthservices","medicalinformatics"],"title":"Feasibility of web-based decision aids in neurological patients","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/feasibility-webbased-decision-aids-neurological-patients-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8386076,"mean":7.0651873001299,"rank":2151345,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5089120,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8386076,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245778,"mean":8.4243033481571,"rank":71396,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":168416,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245778,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":577,"mean":3.3413854166667,"rank":147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":338,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":577,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":3.8272727272727,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
