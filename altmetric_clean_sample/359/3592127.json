In C. aperea, interactions with mothers and unfamiliar females were largely similar; in G. monasteriensis, interactions with the mother, but not unfamiliar female, were characterized by physical closeness and sociopositive behavior. In G. monasteriensis, plasma cortisol levels were lower when with the mother than when with the unfamiliar female. Results are consistent with the species' social organizations and suggest that behavioral interactions of pups with mothers and other females in domestic guinea pigs reflect primarily the social organization of the progenitor species rather than domestication.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d20","doi":"10.1037\/0735-7036.120.1.12","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T13:36:13+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Journal of Comparative Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1386731106,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1037\/0735-7036.120.1.12"],"pmid":"16551160","pubdate":"2006-03-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Social organization predicts nature of infant-adult interactions in two species of wild guinea pigs (Cavia aperea and Galea monasteriensis).","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/social-organization-predicts-nature-infantadult-interactions-two-species-wild-guinea-pigs-cavia-aper"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626769,"mean":4.9522514062143,"rank":817852,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2285442,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626769,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94744,"mean":8.1451172329355,"rank":24552,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69109,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94744,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":328,"mean":4.7724525993884,"rank":87,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":98,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":328,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
