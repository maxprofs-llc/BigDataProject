The selected patients were allocated into 2 broad groups: GrII (Schistosomiasis) which was subdivided into 3 subgroups: GrII(a) schistosomal patients with hepatosplenomegaly; GrII(b) hepatosplenic schistosomal patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis; GrII(c) schistosomal patients with no organomegaly. GrIII (Combined) comprised 2 subgroups: GrIII(a) schistosomal-HCV infection with decompensated liver cirrhosis; GrIII(b) schistosomal-HCV infection without liver cirrhosis. For statistical comparison normal healthy subjects were taken as a reference group (Gr I). Results showed that schistosomal patients without organomegaly manifested non significant changes in all studied parameters compared to normal controls. Highly significant elevations in serum ALT, AST, ALP and GGT activities were recorded in all other subgroups but the highest levels are reported in GrIIb. AST\/ALT and direct\/indirect bilirubin ratios were highest in GrIIIa (1.17+\/-0.26, 1.54 +\/- 0.37, respectively). Serum total protein and albumin levels showed the highest reduction (33 and 59%) concomitantly with the highest increase in gamma-globulin level (75%) in GrIII(a). Blood total iron was significantly reduced in GrII(a,b) (15.6 and 12%) (8.8%) bilirubin, GGT and AST in this order are good discriminators between the different subgroups in GrII. On the other hand, ALT, AST, albumin, ALP, GGT, protein and direct bilirubin are the most significant indices to differentiate chronic schistosomiasis and the combined group with\/or without liver cirrhosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000271d","authors":["F A Fahim","A Y Esmat","G K Hassan","A Abdel-Bary"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T15:38:59+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0278-0240"],"issue":"3-4","journal":"Disease Markers","last_mentioned_on":1328848216,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11381190"],"pmcid":"PMC3851732","pmid":"11381190","pubdate":"2000-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Biochemical changes in patients with combined chronic schistosomiasis and viral hepatitis C infections.","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biochemical-changes-patients-combined-chronic-schistosomiasis-viral-hepatitis-c-infections"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630978,"mean":4.9279868812221,"rank":816185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2292376,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630978,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95716,"mean":8.2529419631199,"rank":24976,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69654,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95716,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167,"mean":1.9380843373494,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":2.3254,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"EG":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Fawzia Fahim","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=476067666#altmetric_citation_3","license":"public","citation_ids":[3598303,3598305],"posted_on":"2012-02-10T04:30:16+00:00","summary":"Fawzia Abbas Fahim (December 9, 1931, Al-Fayoum, Egypt) is an Egyptian biochemist and environmental biologist known for her work on the anti-tumoral effects of snake venom and iodoacetate.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=20476362","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Chris Capoccia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Chris Capoccia"}}]}}
