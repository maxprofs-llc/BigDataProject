(C. Li)"],"citation":{"abstract":"Short human telomeric (HT) DNA sequences form single G-quadruplex (G4 ) units and exhibit structure-based stereocontrol for a series of reactions. However, for more biologically relevant higher-order HT G4 -DNAs (beyond a single G4 unit), the catalytic performances are unknown. Here, we found that higher-order HT G4 -DNA copper metalloenzymes (two or three G4 units) afford remarkably higher enantioselectivity (>90\u2009% ee) and a five- to sixfold rate increase, compared to a single G4 unit, for the Diels-Alder reaction. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and enzymatic kinetic studies revealed that the distinct catalytic function between single and higher-order G4 -DNA copper metalloenzymes can be attributed to different Cu(II) coordination environments and substrate specificity. Our finding suggests that, like protein enzymes and ribozymes, higher-order structural organization is crucial for G4 -DNA-based catalysis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008dd9","authors":["Li, Yinghao","Jia, Guoqing","Wang, Changhao","Cheng, Mingpan","Li, Can"],"doi":"10.1002\/cbic.201402692","endpage":"624","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T15:07:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1439-7633","1439-4227"],"issue":"4","journal":"ChemBioChem","last_mentioned_on":1423887614,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cbic.201402692\/abstract;jsessionid=A020EB604D24C19AF55B6314BBC17D3A.f04t01","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/cbic.201402692?fb_ref=Default&fb_source=message","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/cbic.201402692"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cbic.201402692\/pdf","pmid":"25676722","pubdate":"2015-02-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"618","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Higher\u2010Order Human Telomeric G\u2010Quadruplex DNA Metalloenzymes Enhance Enantioselectivity in the Diels\u2013Alder Reaction","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/higherorder-human-telomeric-gquadruplex-dna-metalloenzymes-enhance-enantioselectivity-dielsalder-rea"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6394888,"mean":5.9820632261367,"rank":4492544,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1669864,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6394888,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":206481,"mean":8.5852072936847,"rank":131772,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":65161,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":206481,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1578,"mean":2.2860951173114,"rank":611,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":699,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1578,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":10.7997,"rank":54,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
