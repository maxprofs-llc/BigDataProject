Pathogenesis may be associated with high-risk human papillomavirus genotypes, and sexual transmission is the most likely mode of acquisition. Risk of progression to invasive disease is low. Treatment usually involves locally destructive or ablative therapies. We report well-tolerated, successful clearance of bowenoid papulosis of the penis in a 25-year-old male, using topical Aldara (imiquimod) cream 5%, once every other day for two months.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006615","authors":["B.
