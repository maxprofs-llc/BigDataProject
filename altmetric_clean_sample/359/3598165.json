These patients present with deficits such as imitating meaningful or meaningless gestures and in dexterity or purposeful use of objects. The different forms of apraxia originate from lesions of different levels\/structures of the motor system, reflecting its complexity. Apraxias are caused by deficits in motor programmes generated in the frontal motor areas, in modality-specific higher sensorimotor control, or at the highest level of motor planning and motor conception. The types of apraxia differentially affect activities of daily living and hence show marked differences in the prognosis of recovery and the physiotherapeutic treatment required. Therefore, appropriate diagnosis and treatment of the different forms are of foremost clinical importance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f610003184","authors":["Prof. Dr. F.
