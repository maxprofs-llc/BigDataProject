In the present work, we study the expression of Zac1 during early embryogenesis and we determine the cellular phenotype of the Zac1-expressing cells throughout development. Our results show that Zac1 is expressed in the progenitor\/stem cells of several tissues (nervous system, skeleton, and skeletal muscle), because they colocalize with several progenitor\/stem markers (Nestin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, FORSE-1, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and bromodeoxyuridine). In postnatal development, Zac1 is expressed in all phases of the life cycle of the chondrocytes (from proliferation to apoptosis), in some limbic gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic neuronal subpopulations, and during developmental myofibers. Therefore, the intense expression of Zac1 in the progenitor\/stem cells of different cellular lineages during the proliferative cycle, before differentiation into postmitotic cells, suggests that Zac1 plays an important role in the control of cell fate during neurogenesis, chondrogenesis, and myogenesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f6100070f2","authors":["Valente, Tony","Junyent, F\u00e8lix","Auladell, Carme"],"doi":"10.1002\/dvdy.20373","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T15:11:32+00:00","issns":["1097-0177"],"journal":"Developmental Dynamics","last_mentioned_on":1248346845,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/dvdy.20373","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15844099"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/dvdy.20373\/pdf","pmid":"15844099","pubdate":"2005-04-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["anatomy"],"title":"Zac1 is expressed in progenitor\/stem cells of the neuroectoderm and mesoderm during embryogenesis: differential phenotype of the Zac1-expressing cells during development.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/zac1-expressed-progenitorstem-cells-neuroectoderm-mesoderm-during-embryogenesis-differential-phenoty"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629660,"mean":4.9331369641107,"rank":816329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290597,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629660,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95412,"mean":8.2310196937462,"rank":24821,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69510,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95412,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":547,"mean":2.0175494505495,"rank":54,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":361,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":547,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.505,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
