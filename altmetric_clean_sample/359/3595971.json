SWCNTs with one end collapsed and the other circular are chosen for demonstration. At a low temperature, the collapsed zone spreads over the whole tube, while at a higher temperature, the collapsed zone shrinks, and the circular zone extends along the tube. The reason for the reversible domino process is that the temperature modifies the stable state of the tube. The temperature-induced reversible domino process of SWCNTs provides opportunities for the design of nanoscale heat engines, rechargeable expelling devices, temperature-sensitive devices, mechanical oscillators, and pulse generators, etc.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2010NanoL..10.3490C","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003145","authors":["Tienchong Chang"],"doi":"10.1021\/nl101623c","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T14:52:01+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Nano Letters","last_mentioned_on":1336508740,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/nl101623c","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20681525"],"pmid":"20681525","pubdate":"2010-08-05T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Temperature-induced reversible dominoes in carbon nanotubes.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/temperatureinduced-reversible-dominoes-carbon-nanotubes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628714,"mean":4.9390391673343,"rank":816845,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288938,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628714,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95255,"mean":8.2149277930587,"rank":24766,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69411,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95255,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2348,"mean":10.176045164039,"rank":1166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":1020,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2348,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":136,"mean":6.7872592592593,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":87,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":136,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
