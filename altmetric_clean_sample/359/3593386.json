Positive Charge (PC) was a national HIV linkage and re-engagement in care program implemented by AIDS United. This study describes three PC programs, the characteristics of their participants, and the continuum of engagement in care for their participants. Eighty-eight percent of participants were engaged in care post PC enrollment. Sixty-nine percent were retained in care, and 46\u00a0% were virally suppressed at follow-up. Older participants were more likely to be engaged, retained, and virally suppressed. Differences by race and gender in HIV care and treatment varied across PC programs, reflecting the diverse target populations, locations, and strategies employed by the PC grantees. There is an urgent need for programs that promote HIV care and treatment among vulnerable populations, including young people living with HIV. There is also an urgent need for additional research to test the effectiveness of promising linkage and retention in care strategies, such as peer navigation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f6100056e0","authors":["Cathy Maulsby","Vignetta Charles","Suzanne Kinsky","Maura Riordan","Kriti Jain","David Holtgrave"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10461-015-1015-0","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T14:01:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-3254"],"journal":"AIDS & Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1423829747,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25673009"],"pmid":"25673009","pubdate":"2015-02-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Health Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome","behavioralsciences"],"title":"Positive Charge: Filling the Gaps in the U.S. HIV Continuum of Care.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/positive-charge-filling-gaps-hiv-continuum-care"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4755858,"mean":5.7089565439016,"rank":3980116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4755858,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170954,"mean":8.8269361754403,"rank":137978,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170954,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1108,"mean":3.7562872628726,"rank":1034,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1108,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":2.5945945945946,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
