We aim to determine whether social network size is related to the likelihood of hospitalisation and the amount of service use.\nAs part of a prospective controlled study, baseline interview data for a random sample of one-year prevalent cases with non-organic psychosis were analysed with respect to social network characteristics and service use during a six-month period.\nThe likelihood of hospitalisation decreased with an increase in network size, while the number of services used by patients grew as the social network size increased.\nWhile larger social networks may be associated with a lower likelihood of hospitalization, they may also be related to wider use of non-hospital services.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100057a0","authors":["T.
