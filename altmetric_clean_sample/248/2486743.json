Type 2 APS is defined by the occurrence of Addison's disease with thyroid autoimmune disease and\/or Type 1 diabetes mellitus. Clinically overt disorders are considered only the tip of the autoimmune iceberg, since latent forms are much more frequent. Historical, clinical, genetic, and immunological aspects of Type 2 APS are reviewed. Furthermore, data on 146 personal cases of Type 2 APS are also reported.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002548","authors":["C Betterle","F Lazzarotto","F Presotto","C.
