SREBP-1c activation requires the proteolytic maturation of the endoplasmic-reticulum-bound precursor to the active, nuclear transcription factor, which is stimulated by feeding and insulin signaling. Here, we show that feeding and insulin stimulate the hepatic expression of PASK. We also demonstrate, using genetic and pharmacological approaches, that PASK is required for the proteolytic maturation of SREBP-1c in cultured cells and in the mouse and rat liver. Inhibition of PASK improves lipid and glucose metabolism in dietary animal models of obesity and dyslipidemia. Administration of a PASK inhibitor decreases hepatic expression of lipogenic SREBP-1c target genes, decreases serum triglycerides, and partially reverses insulin resistance. While the signaling network that controls SREBP-1c activation is complex, we propose that PASK is an important component with therapeutic potential.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"52d545303cf058dd068b4567","authors":["Xiaoying Wu","Donna Romero","Wojciech\u00a0I.
