Gene therapy via the CSF offers a means to achieve a long-term sustainable supply of therapeutic proteins within the central nervous system (CNS) by setting up a continuous source of transgenic products. In the present study, a serotype 1 adeno-associated virus (AAV1) vector was injected into a lateral cerebral ventricle in adult mice to transduce the gene encoding human lysosomal enzyme arylsulfatase A (hASA) into the cells of the CNS. Widespread transduction and stable expression of hASA in the choroid plexus and ependymal cells was observed throughout the ventricles for more than 1 year after vector injection. Although humoral immunity to hASA developed after 6 weeks, which diminished the hASA levels detected in CSF from AAV1-injected mice, hASA levels in CSF were maintained for at least 12 weeks when the mice were tolerized to hASA prior of vector injection. Our results suggest that the cells lining the ventricles could potentially serve as a biological reservoir for long-term continuous secretion of lysosomal enzymes into the CSF following intracerebroventricular injection of an AAV1 vector.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Yoshiyuki Yamazaki","Yukihiko Hirai","Koichi Miyake","Takashi Shimada"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep05506","first_seen_on":"2014-07-07T08:13:00+00:00","issns":["xxxx-xxxx","2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1404720486,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/srep05506"],"pmid":"24981028","pubdate":"2014-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetic vectors","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Metabolic disorders","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Genetic transduction","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Targeted gene transfer into ependymal cells through intraventricular injection of AAV1 vector and long-term enzyme replacement via the CSF","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/targeted-gene-transfer-ependymal-cells-through-intraventricular-injection-aav1-vector-longterm-enzym"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":3553871,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":836556,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125278,"mean":8.1675720044384,"rank":83562,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":24478,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125278,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15808,"mean":13.310788384893,"rank":11673,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":2517,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15808,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":712,"mean":12.469029535865,"rank":544,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":69,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":712,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
