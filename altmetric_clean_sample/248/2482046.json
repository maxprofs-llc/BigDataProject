They are geochemical profiles, geomagnetic variations, and tectonic stresses. In the geochemical domain, copper, aluminum, zinc, and lithium may influence the incidence of thought disorders such as schizophrenia and senile dementia. These common elements are found in many soils and ground water. Geomagnetic variations have been correlated with enhanced anxiety, sleep disturbances, altered moods, and greater incidences of psychiatric admissions. The effects are usually brief but pervasive. Transient and very local epidemics of bizarre and unusual behaviors are sociological phenomena that sometimes precede increases in earthquake activity within a region; they have been hypothesized to be associated with tectonic strain. Many of the contemporary correlations between geological factors and human behavior are also apparent within historical data. The effects of geophysical and geochemical factors upon human behavior are not artifactual, but they are complex and often not detected by the limited scope of most studies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6fb3cf058f61000a38c","authors":["M A Persinger"],"first_seen_on":"2014-07-02T20:15:05+00:00","issns":["0014-4754"],"issue":"1","journal":"Experientia","last_mentioned_on":1404331982,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3792507"],"pmid":"3792507","pubdate":"1987-01-15T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["science"],"title":"Geopsychology and geopsychopathology: mental processes and disorders associated with geochemical and geophysical factors.","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/geopsychology-geopsychopathology-mental-processes-disorders-associated-geochemical-geophysical-facto"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3967078,"mean":5.0309815067968,"rank":2213379,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1023969,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3967078,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99380,"mean":7.6477455548066,"rank":52463,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":26551,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99380,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":312,"mean":2.4164516129032,"rank":213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":81,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":312,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
