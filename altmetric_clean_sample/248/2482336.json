Dissociative patients reported significantly more dissociative and nondissociative symptoms than did nondissociative patients and nonclinical controls. When general psychopathology was controlled, the dissociation scores of dissociative patients were still significantly higher than those of both other groups, whereas the dissociation scores of nondissociative patients and nonclinical controls no longer differed. These findings appear to be congruent with a typological model of dissociation that distinguishes between 2 qualitatively different kinds of dissociation. Specifically, the results of this study suggest that the dissociation that occurs in major dissociative disorders (i.e., dissociative identity disorder [DID] and dissociative disorder not otherwise specified, Type 1 [DDNOS-1]) is qualitatively different from the dissociation that occurs in persons who do not have a dissociative disorder. In contrast to previous research, the dissociation of persons who do not have a dissociative disorder is not limited to absorption; it covers a much wider range of phenomena. The authors hypothesize that different mechanisms produce the dissociation of persons with DID and DDNOS-1 as opposed to the dissociation of persons who do not have a dissociative disorder.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f61000140c","authors":[" Frauke   Rodewald   PhD ","Rodewald F","Dell PF","Wilhelm-Gossling C","Gast U"],"doi":"10.1080\/15299732.2010.514847","first_seen_on":"2014-07-02T22:56:08+00:00","issns":["1529-9732","1529-9740"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Trauma &amp; Dissociation","last_mentioned_on":1404680867,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/15299732.2010.514847"],"pmid":"21240735","pubdate":"2011-01-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Sociology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"title":"Are major dissociative disorders characterized by a qualitatively different kind of dissociation?","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/major-dissociative-disorders-characterized-qualitatively-different-kind-dissociation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3980912,"mean":5.0330335661942,"rank":556957,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":3417013,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3980912,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99559,"mean":7.658631932098,"rank":16936,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":82555,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99559,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":153,"mean":3.0722105263158,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":122,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":153,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":3.85,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
