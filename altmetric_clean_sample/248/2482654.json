Under the optimized conditions: buffer solution of 20 mmol\/L Na(2)B(4)O(7)-KH(2)PO(4) (pH 9.0)-20mmol\/L SDS-6mmol\/L \u03b2-CD-5%(v\/v) MeCN, applied voltage of 16 kV and injection time of 8s, the two analytes were separated well within 10 minutes. The calibration was linear in the 0.02-0.80 and 0.02-0.70 mg\/mL range for kaempferol and quercetin, respectively. The reproducibility based on migration time and peak height were 0.47% and1.87% for kaempferol, 0.55% and 2.02% for quercetin. The detection limits based on three times noise were 0.010 mg\/mL and 0.008 mg\/mL for kaempferol and quercetin, respectively. The developed method was utilized to analyze real samples and running recovery experiments with satisfactory results.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6a13cf058f610009a10","authors":["Lu Y","Wang D","Ning Z","Yao Q"],"first_seen_on":"2014-07-03T02:13:45+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"3","journal":"Pakistan Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1404345528,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24811806"],"pmid":"24811806","pubdate":"2014-05-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["chemistry","pharmacology"],"title":"Determination of kaempferol and quercetin in Xindakang tablet by \u03b2-cyclodextrin modified micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography.","type":"article","volume":"27"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3967078,"mean":5.0309815067968,"rank":757109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":3182851,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3967078,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99386,"mean":7.655017246584,"rank":22085,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":76858,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99386,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164,"mean":1.3916564417178,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":155,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":0.85384615384615,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Reports Outline Electrokinetics Study Results from Dezhou University (Determination of kaempferol and quercetin in Xindakang tablet by ?-cyclodextrin...","url":"http:\/\/www.hispanicbusiness.com\/2014\/7\/2\/reports_outline_electrokinetics_study_results_from.htm","license":"public","citation_ids":[2482654],"posted_on":"2014-07-02T23:58:48+00:00","summary":"Reports Outline Electrokinetics Study Results from Dezhou University (Determination of kaempferol and quercetin in Xindakang tablet by ?-cyclodextrin modified micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography) By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Drug We","author":{"name":"Hispanic Business","url":"http:\/\/www.hispanicbusiness.com\/","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/000\/841\/normal\/image.png?1399456542"}}]}}
