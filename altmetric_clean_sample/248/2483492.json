The treatment process combined ozonation with ceramic ultra-filtration (UF), coagulation for pre-treatment and granular activated carbon filtration. A flat-sheet ceramic membrane was used with a cut-off of 60\u00a0nm and the measurement of 254\u00a0mm (length) \u00d7 240\u00a0mm (width) \u00d7 6\u00a0mm (thickness). Ozonation and ceramic UF was set up whthin one reactor. The experimental results showed that the removal efficiencies of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the formation potential of trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs) and ammonia were 80%, 76%, 70% and 90%, respectively; that the turbidity of the product water was below 0.2 NTU and the particle count number (particles larger than 2\u00a0\u03bcm) was less than 50 counts per mL. The result also showed that all the pathogenic microorganisms were retained by the ceramic and that UF. Ozonation played a critical role in the control of membrane fouling and the removal of contaminants. Exactly, the membrane fouling can be controlled in situ with 3\u00a0mg L(-1) ozone at the permeate flux of 80 L m(-2)\u2009h(-1), yet the required dosage of ozone was dependent on the quality of the raw water. Therefore, this study is able to provide a highly compacted system for decentralized supply of high-quality drinking water in terms of both chemical and microbiological safety for the rural areas in China.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ce3cf058f61000061c","authors":["Jia Zhu"],"doi":"10.1080\/10934529.2014.910068","first_seen_on":"2014-07-03T13:31:48+00:00","issns":["1093-4529"],"issue":"11","journal":"Journal of Environmental Science & Health, Part A: Toxic\/Hazardous Substances & Environmental Engineering","last_mentioned_on":1404394261,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/10934529.2014.910068#.U7VanY2SzIU"],"pmid":"24967563","pubdate":"2014-06-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Study on an integrated process combining ozonation with ceramic ultra-filtration for decentralized supply of drinking water","type":"article","volume":"49","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/study-integrated-process-combining-ozonation-ceramic-ultrafiltration-decentralized-supply-drinking-w"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3976183,"mean":5.0322164403834,"rank":2219672,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1025147,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3976183,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99470,"mean":7.6576909527784,"rank":52584,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":26542,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99470,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125,"mean":2.2531612903226,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":60,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":2.0213333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
