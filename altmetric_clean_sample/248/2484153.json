MVs carry a battery of signaling molecules, many of them related to redox-regulated processes. The role of MVs, either as a cause or as a result of cellular redox signaling, has been increasingly recognized over the past decade. This is in part due to advances in flow cytometry and its detection of MVs. Notably, recent studies have shown that circulating MVs from platelets and endothelial cells drive reactive species-dependent angiogenesis; circulating MVs in cancer alter the microenvironment and enhance invasion through horizontal transfer of mutated proteins and nucleic acids and harbor redox-regulated matrix metalloproteinases and procoagulative surface molecules; and circulating MVs from red blood cells and other cells modulate cell-cell interactions through scavenging or production of nitric oxide and other free radicals. Although our recognition of MVs in redox-related processes is growing, especially in the vascular biology field, much remains unknown regarding the various biologic and pathologic functions of MVs. Like reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, MVs were originally believed to have a solely pathological role in biology. And like our understanding of reactive species, it is now clear that MVs also play an important role in normal growth, development, and homeostasis. We are just beginning to understand how MVs are involved in various biological processes-developmental, homeostatic, and pathological-and the role of MVs in redox signaling is a rich and exciting area of investigation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002911","doi":"10.1016\/j.freeradbiomed.2014.04.017","first_seen_on":"2014-07-03T19:06:03+00:00","funders":["phs","nigms","nhlbi"],"issns":["08915849"],"journal":"Free Radical Biology & Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1420306612,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0891584914001865","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24751526"],"pmid":"24751526","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Circulating Membrane-Derived Microvesicles in Redox Biology.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/circulating-membranederived-microvesicles-redox-biology"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691823,"mean":5.4318361211662,"rank":3035411,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1480629,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691823,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110389,"mean":8.0709941841505,"rank":68557,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":37530,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110389,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1236,"mean":3.4142510121457,"rank":750,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":452,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1236,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":4.1218518518519,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
