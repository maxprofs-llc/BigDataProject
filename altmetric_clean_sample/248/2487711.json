In the current research this is particularly relevant as the location, Tasmania, has the second highest incidence of CF in the world. This paper provides an overview of the evaluation of a pilot trial of an information system conceptualised and developed to assist people with CF, and their families, to enhance their skills and communication in relation to self-management for their condition.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5263cf058f610003da6","authors":["Roehrer E","Cummings E","Beggs S","Turner P","Hauser J","Micallef N","Ellis L","Reid D"],"doi":"10.3109\/17538157.2013.812646","endpage":"365","first_seen_on":"2014-07-06T10:02:58+00:00","issns":["1753-8157","1753-8165"],"issue":"4","journal":"Informatics for Health & Social Care","last_mentioned_on":1404640933,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23957685?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23957685","pubdate":"2013-08-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Library And Information Studies","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information Systems","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Nursing","Health Professions"],"startpage":"354","subjects":["medicalinformatics"],"title":"Pilot evaluation of web enabled symptom monitoring in cystic fibrosis.","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pilot-evaluation-web-enabled-symptom-monitoring-cystic-fibrosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3569202,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":138405,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108902,"mean":7.8656805355325,"rank":83164,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":906,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108902,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":1.7320512820513,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":2.2166666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
