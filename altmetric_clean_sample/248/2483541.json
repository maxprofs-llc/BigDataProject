Screening in the Control of #BreastCancer: Understanding Underpinnings of Current Debates."],"citation":{"abstract":"Since the introduction of mammography screening, debates about the value of screening have endured and been contentious. Recent reviews of the randomized controlled trials reach different conclusions about the absolute benefit of screening, as do evaluations of population trends in breast cancer mortality and the evaluations of service screening. Conclusions about the value of screening commonly are expressed in terms of the balance of benefits and harms, which can differ greatly even when derived seemingly from the same data. It can be shown when different estimates are adjusted to a common screening and follow-up scenario, differences in balance sheet estimates diminish substantially. The strong evidence of benefit associated with exposure to modern mammography screening suggests that it is time to move beyond the randomized controlled trial estimates of benefit and consider policy decisions on the basis of benefits and harms estimated from the evaluation of current screening programs.
