The purpose of this article was to collect and review literature on the thermo-chemical conversion of triglyceride based materials. The literature was divided and discussed as (1) direct thermal cracking and (2) combination of thermal and catalytic cracking. Typically, four main catalyst types are used including transition metal catalysts, molecular sieve type catalysts, activated alumina, and sodium carbonate. Reaction products are heavily dependant on the catalyst type and reaction conditions and can range from diesel like fractions to gasoline like fractions. Research in this area is not as advanced as bio-oil and bio-diesel research and there is opportunity for further study in the areas of reaction optimization, detailed characterization of products and properties, and scale-up.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f5","doi":"10.1016\/j.biortech.2006.10.025","first_seen_on":"2014-07-04T07:06:17+00:00","issns":["09608524"],"journal":"Bioresource Technology","last_mentioned_on":1404457354,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0960852406005852"],"pmid":"17166713","pubdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Pyrolysis of triglyceride materials for the production of renewable fuels and chemicals ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pyrolysis-triglyceride-materials-production-renewable-fuels-chemicals-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3976406,"mean":5.0321946101045,"rank":3176942,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":97397,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3976406,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99464,"mean":7.6665846973659,"rank":78799,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":375,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99464,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":898,"mean":1.7867714604236,"rank":548,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":898,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":0.58837209302326,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":11,"Researcher":34,"Student  > Doctoral Student":14,"Student  > Ph.
