Asthma involves not only chronic airway remodeling, but may also include frequent exacerbations resulting from bronchospasm, edema, and mucus production. In children with severe exacerbations, standard therapy with \u03b22-agonists, anti-cholinergic agents, oxygen, and systemic steroids may fail to reverse the severe airflow obstruction and necessitate use of adjunctive therapies. These therapies include intravenous or inhaled magnesium, inhaled helium-oxygen mixtures, intravenous methylxanthines, intravenous \u03b22-agonists, and intravenous ketamine. Rarely, these measures are not successful and following the initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation, inhaled anesthetics or extracorporeal life support may be required. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms and evidence for adjunctive therapies in the setting of severe acute asthma exacerbations in children.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073da","authors":["Judith Jm Wong","Jan Hau Lee","David A Turner","Kyle J Rehder","Wong JJ","Lee JH","Turner DA","Rehder KJ","Judith JM Wong"],"doi":"10.1586\/17476348.2014.915752","endpage":"441","first_seen_on":"2014-07-06T14:10:49+00:00","issns":["1747-6356","1747-6348"],"issue":"4","journal":"Expert Review of Respiratory Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1428150598,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24993063?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24993063?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1586\/17476348.2014.915752","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24993063","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24993063?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24993063","pubdate":"2014-07-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"423","subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"A review of the use of adjunctive therapies in severe acute asthma exacerbation in critically ill children.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1586\/17476348.2014.915752","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/review-adjunctive-therapies-severe-acute-asthma-exacerbation-critically-ill-children-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7360562,"mean":6.3951573365093,"rank":1504489,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":5807445,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7360562,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174705,"mean":7.2244066191962,"rank":37698,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":136190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174705,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":340,"mean":2.0127728613569,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":309,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":340,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":0.53333333333333,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
