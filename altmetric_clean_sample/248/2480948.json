Ileal pouches offer improved quality of life and high patient satisfaction; however, there are many pouch-related complications due to the original disease process and change in anatomy. This is a review article of the common and some rare surgical complications after J pouches, which can be subdivided into the septic and nonseptic categories. Septic-related complications include anastomotic leak, abscess, and fistulas, whereas common nonseptic-related complications include small bowel obstruction, strictures, Crohn's disease, pouchitis, and cuffitis. Rare nonseptic complications to be discussed are prolapse, volvulus, and neoplasia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f610007774","authors":["Jingjing Sherman","Adrian J Greenstein","Alexander J Greenstein"],"doi":"10.1097\/mib.0000000000000086","first_seen_on":"2014-07-02T10:09:51+00:00","issns":["1536-4844"],"journal":"Inflammatory Bowel Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1404295626,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24983986?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24983986","pubdate":"2014-06-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Ileal J Pouch Complications and Surgical Solutions: A Review.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ileal-j-pouch-complications-surgical-solutions-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3969618,"mean":5.0317763335242,"rank":3170362,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":97403,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3969618,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99442,"mean":7.655295367009,"rank":78746,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":377,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99442,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":993,"mean":2.6731048387097,"rank":833,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":993,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":3.759,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
