Being clinically under-recognized, its true incidence is not known. Maternal thrombophilia is likely to be a predisposing factor. To date, a general consensus for evaluation of babies born to mothers with genetic thrombotic predisposition is missing. This study was undertaken to assess the frequency of cerebral abnormalities in the offspring of women with homozygous C677T mutation in the MTHFR gene, and to seek for association with additional maternal or pregnancy risk factors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d10","authors":["Pogliani L","Cerini C","Penagini F","Duca P","Mameli C","Zuccotti GV"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12519-014-0490-0","first_seen_on":"2014-07-05T21:12:36+00:00","issns":["1708-8569"],"issue":"","journal":"World Journal of Pediatrics","last_mentioned_on":1461790502,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/24974211\/"],"pmid":"24974211","pubdate":"2014-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Cerebral ultrasound abnormalities in offspring of women with C677T homozygous mutation in the MTHFR gene: a prospective study.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cerebral-ultrasound-abnormalities-offsprings-women-c677t-homozygous-mutation-mthfr-gene-prospective"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8198914,"mean":6.9309797684091,"rank":5921853,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2265298,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8198914,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179043,"mean":7.4973717228362,"rank":105521,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":73108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179043,"percentile":40},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":137,"mean":2.7738823529412,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":73,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":137,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.17,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
