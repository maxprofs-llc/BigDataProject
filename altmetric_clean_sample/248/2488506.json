Amino acid transporters are also of high pharmacological relevance because they may mediate uptake of toxic amino acid analogs. We now show that the eflornithine transporter AAT6 from Trypanosoma brucei mediates growth on neutral amino acids when expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants. The transport was electrogenic and further analyzed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Neutral amino acids, proline analogs, eflornithine and acivicin induced inward currents. For proline, glycine and tryptophan the apparent affinities and maximal transport rates increased with more negative membrane potentials. Proline-induced currents were dependent on pH, but not on sodium. Although proline represents the primary energy source of T. brucei in the tsetse fly, down-regulation of TbAAT6-expression by RNAi showed that in culture TbAAT6 is not essential for growth of procyclic form trypanosomes in the presence of glucose or proline as energy source. TbAAT6-RNAi lines of both bloodstream and procyclic form trypanosomes showed reduced susceptibility to eflornithine whereas the sensitivity to acivicin remained unchanged, indicating that acivicin is entering the cell by more than one transporter.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c1","authors":["Christoph Mathieu","Amaia Gonz\u00e1lez Salgado","Corina Wirdnam","Stefan Meier","Marianne Suter Grotemeyer","Ehud Inbar","Pascal M\u00e4ser","Dan Zilberstein","Erwin Sigel","Peter B\u00fctikofer","Doris Rentsch"],"doi":"10.1042\/bj20140719","first_seen_on":"2014-07-06T22:07:09+00:00","issns":["1470-8728","0264-6021"],"journal":"Biochemical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1410361369,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24988048?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.biochemj.org\/bj\/463\/bj4630009.htm"],"pmid":"24988048","pubdate":"2014-07-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Trypanosoma brucei eflornithine transporter AAT6 is a low-affinity low-selective transporter for neutral amino acids","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/itrypanosoma-bruceii-eflornithine-transporter-aat6-lowaffinity-lowselective-transporter-neutral-amin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":3055003,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":928410,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108906,"mean":7.9020736788948,"rank":71943,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":24719,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108906,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4116,"mean":2.1444933171324,"rank":3027,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":875,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4116,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.575,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
