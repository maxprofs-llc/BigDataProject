Specific NAIP proteins bind to the agonists and then physically associate with NLRC4 to form an inflammasome complex able to recruit and activate pro-caspase-1. NAIP5 and NAIP6 sense flagellin, component of flagella from motile bacteria, whereas NAIP1 and NAIP2 detect needle and rod components from bacterial type III secretion systems, respectively. Active caspase-1 mediates the maturation and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, and is responsible for the induction of pyroptosis, a pro-inflammatory form of cell death. In addition to these well-known effector mechanisms, novel roles have been described for NAIP\/NLRC4 inflammasomes, such as phagosomal maturation, activation of inducible nitric oxide synthase, regulation of autophagy, secretion of inflammatory mediators, antibody production, activation of T cells, among others. These effector mechanisms mediated by NAIP\/NLRC4 inflammasomes have been extensively studied in the context of resistance of infections and the potential of their agonists has been exploited in therapeutic strategies to non-infectious pathologies, such as tumor protection. Thus, this review will discuss current knowledge about the activation of NAIP\/NLRC4 inflammasomes and their effector mechanisms.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90c3cf058f61000cb02","authors":["Lage, Silvia Lucena","Longo, Carla","Branco, Laura Migliari","da Costa, Thais Boccia","Buzzo, Carina de Lima","Bortoluci, Karina Ramalho","da Costa, Tha\u00eds Boccia"],"doi":"10.3389\/fimmu.2014.00309","first_seen_on":"2014-07-02T12:19:01+00:00","issns":["","1664-3224"],"journal":"Frontiers in immunology","last_mentioned_on":1404303440,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fimmu.2014.00309\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fimmu.2014.00309\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4078251","pmid":"25071770","pubdate":"2014-06-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Emerging Concepts about NAIP\/NLRC4 Inflammasomes","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/emerging-concepts-about-naipnlrc4-inflammasomes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":3038417,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":928719,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108718,"mean":7.8698906150835,"rank":70994,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":24749,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108718,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1852,"mean":1.7330772555375,"rank":1163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":536,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1852,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119,"mean":2.7664745762712,"rank":94,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
