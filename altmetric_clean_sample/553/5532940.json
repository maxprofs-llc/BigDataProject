In this research, a laccase gene from Colletotrichum lagenarium was chemically synthesised using yeast bias codons and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The molecular mass of the recombinant laccase was estimated to be 64.6\u00a0kDa by SDS-PAGE, and the enzyme exhibited maximum activity at pH 3.6-4.0 but more stability in buffer with higher pH (>pH 3.6). The optimal reaction temperature of the enzyme was 40\u00a0\u00b0C, beyond which stability significantly decreased. By using 2,2'-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline)-6-sulphonate (ABTS) as a substrate, K m and V max values of 0.34\u00a0mM and 7.11\u00a0mM\u00a0min(-1)\u00a0mg(-1), respectively, were obtained. Using ABTS as a mediator, the laccase could oxidise hydroquinone to p-benzoquinone and decolourise the synthetic dyes malachite green, crystal violet and orange G. These results indicated that the laccase could be used to treat industrial effluents containing artificial dyes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f610003740","authors":["Wang, Bo","Yan, Ying","Tian, Yongsheng","Zhao, Wei","Li, Zhengjun","Gao, Jianjie","Peng, Rihe","Yao, Quanhong"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11274-015-1999-7","first_seen_on":"2016-02-13T19:49:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-0972"],"issue":"3","journal":"World Journal of Microbiology & Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1455392933,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26867601?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26867601","pubdate":"2016-02-13T22:01:59+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Applied Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Engineering\/Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology","microbiology"],"title":"Heterologous expression and characterisation of a laccase from Colletotrichum lagenarium and decolourisation of different synthetic dyes","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/heterologous-expression-characterisation-laccase-colletotrichum-lagenarium-decolourisation-different"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7187728,"mean":6.3185455827659,"rank":5408227,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":992490,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7187728,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320712,"mean":9.6306839927533,"rank":222708,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":54000,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320712,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":476,"mean":1.4668084210526,"rank":255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":169,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":476,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":1.7966666666667,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Physics and Astronomy":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/yeast_papers\/statuses\/698594714879045635","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5532940],"posted_on":"2016-02-13T19:48:53+00:00","author":{"name":"yeast_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yeast","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/470859351591092225\/S4XxHSFa_normal.jpeg","description":"Get your fresh daily #yeast #papers from #Pubmed, #Arxiv, #BioRxiv and #PeerJ here!
