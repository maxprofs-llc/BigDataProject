Previous studies have reported correlations between vimentin DNA methylation levels and subsequent vimentin expression levels in solid tumors, including breast and colorectal cancer; however, to the best of our knowledge, such a correlation has not been reported for gastric cancer (GC) using Lauren classification. Therefore, the present study aimed to quantify DNA methylation levels of the vimentin gene using quantitative (q) methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in intestinal-type GC cell lines (MKN-28, AGS and MKN-1), diffuse-type GC cell lines (SGC-7901, SNU-5 and KATO III), the GES-1 immortalized human non-neoplastic gastric epithelial cell line, as well as in tumor and paratumor normal tissue samples. Furthermore, the present study analyzed the messenger RNA expression of the vimentin gene in these cell lines and tissues by reverse transcription-qPCR. A comparison of the clinicopathological features was conducted between patients, grouped according to the Lauren classification. The present study identified that the vimentin promoter region was hypermethylated in all GC cell lines and tumor tissue samples when compared with immortalized normal gastric epithelial cells and paratumor normal tissues. In addition, vimentin promoter methylation levels were observed to be higher in intestinal-type cell lines when compared with those of diffuse-type lines and tissues. Correspondingly, vimentin expression levels were lower in intestinal-type gastric cell lines compared with those of diffuse-type cell lines and tissues, and were lowest in the non-neoplastic gastric cell line and paratumor normal tissues. Patients with diffuse-type GC were on average younger (P=0.023), and exhibited higher tumor (P=0.020), node (P=0.032) and TNM classification of malignant tumor stage (P=0.039) than those with intestinal-type GC. Following treatment of AGS cells (which demonstrated the highest methylation level of the vimentin gene) with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, vimentin expression was restored significantly. Thus, the present study revealed that vimentin promoter methylation levels are inversely correlated with vimentin expression levels in GC (according to Lauren classification). High levels of methylation in the vimentin gene promoter region may be involved in carcinogenesis and the development of GC, and may provide a novel molecular classification for GC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f61000837d","authors":["Cong, Hui","Yao, Ru-Yong","Sun, Zhen-Qing","Qiu, Wen-Sheng","Yao, Ya-Sai","Feng, Tong-Tong","Xin, Chao","Liang, Jun","Yue, L U"],"doi":"10.3892\/ol.2015.3937","first_seen_on":"2016-02-13T13:48:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1792-1074"],"issue":"1","journal":"Oncology Letters","last_mentioned_on":1455371289,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26870294?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26870294","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"DNA hypermethylation of the vimentin gene inversely correlates with vimentin expression in intestinal- and diffuse-type gastric cancer.  - PubMed - NCBI","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dna-hypermethylation-vimentin-gene-inversely-correlates-vimentin-expression-intestinal-diffusetype-g"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7187728,"mean":6.3185455827659,"rank":5408175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":992615,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7187728,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320712,"mean":9.6305692477024,"rank":222671,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":54067,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320712,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1018,"mean":1.389616519174,"rank":369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":441,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1018,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":134,"mean":0.71691729323308,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":64,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":134,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/epigen_papers\/statuses\/698503933375807488","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5531478],"posted_on":"2016-02-13T13:48:09+00:00","author":{"name":"epigenetics_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Epigenetics","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/471205704921931776\/wSQqKYz8_normal.jpeg","description":"Chromatin & epigenetics paper feed from #Pubmed and #Arxiv - hear it here first!
