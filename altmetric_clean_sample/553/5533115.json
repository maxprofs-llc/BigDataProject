PM"],"citation":{"abstract":"A series of AKBA derivatives were synthesized, and evaluated as potent VEGFR-2 inhibitors. The initial biological evaluation indicated that the introduction of C-24 amide group or a heterocycle at C-2,3 position effectively improved the potency. Further structure-activity relationship analysis showed that amide (7, 23, 25, and 26) and heterocycle (19, 34, and 36) substituted AKBA derivatives displayed more potential anti-proliferation activities than AKBA (1) on HUVECs that express high levels of VEGFR-2. Among all tested compounds, compounds 7 and 19 exhibited the best potency (IC50: 2.36 and 2.13\u03bcM) and obvious inhibitory activities with VEGFR-2 inhibition rates of 96% and 94% at 50\u03bcM, respectively.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f1","authors":["Shen, Sida","Xu, Xingyu","Liu, Zhulong","Liu, Junhua","Hu, Lihong"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bmc.2015.03.022","first_seen_on":"2016-02-13T20:58:04+00:00","issns":["1464-3391"],"journal":"Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1455397061,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25819335?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25819335","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"title":"Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of boswellic acid derivatives as potent VEGFR-2 inhibitors","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-structureactivity-relationships-boswellic-acid-derivatives-potent-vegfr2-inhibitors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7187728,"mean":6.3185455827659,"rank":6195172,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7187728,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320713,"mean":9.6306644091892,"rank":266722,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320713,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1186,"mean":2.4111004219409,"rank":849,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1186,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":4.3117021276596,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
