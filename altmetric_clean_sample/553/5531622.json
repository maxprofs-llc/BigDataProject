Novel antimicrobials capable of eradicating S. aureus cells including antibiotic-resistant ones are thus highly desired. Membrane-active bactericides and species-specific antimicrobials are two promising sources of novel anti-infective agents for fighting against bacterial antibiotic-resistance. We herein show that Ca(2+) and Mg(2+), two alkaline-earth-metal ions physiologically essential for diverse living organisms, both disrupt model S. aureus membranes and kill stationary-phase S. aureus cells, indicative of membrane-activity. In contrast to S. aureus, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis exhibit unaffected survival after similar treatment with these two cations, indicative of species-specific activity against S. aureus. Moreover, neither Ca(2+) nor Mg(2+) lyses mouse red blood cells, indicative of hemo-compatibility. This works suggests that Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) may have implications in targeted eradication of S. aureus pathogen including the antibiotic-resistant ones.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Xie, Yuntao","Yang, Lihua"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep20628","first_seen_on":"2016-02-13T14:15:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1455372881,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26865182?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26865182","pubdate":"2016-02-13T22:02:52+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Antibiotics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Biophysical chemistry","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Calcium and Magnesium Ions Are Membrane-Active against Stationary-Phase Staphylococcus aureus with High Specificity","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/calcium-magnesium-ions-membraneactive-against-stationaryphase-staphylococcus-aureus-high-specificity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7187728,"mean":6.3185455827659,"rank":5408178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":992599,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7187728,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320712,"mean":9.6305759515573,"rank":222673,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":54065,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320712,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26164,"mean":14.550763903222,"rank":19446,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":3830,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26164,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2938,"mean":17.126394279877,"rank":2213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":415,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2938,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
