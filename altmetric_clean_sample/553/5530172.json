At present, there is no specific treatment option. Pirfenidone is approved for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with both antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects. We subsequently investigated the impact of pirfenidone treatment on development of fibrosis in a new mouse model of intestinal fibrosis.\nSmall bowel resections from donor mice were transplanted subcutaneously into the neck of recipients. Animals received either pirfenidone (100 mg\/kg, tds, orally) or vehicle.\nAfter administration of pirfenidone, a significantly decreased collagen layer thickness was revealed as compared to vehicle (9.7 \u00b1 1.0 versus 13.5 \u00b1 1.5 \u00b5m, respectively, **P < 0.001). Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 were significantly decreased after treatment with pirfenidone as confirmed by real-time PCR (0.42 \u00b1 0.13 versus 1.00 \u00b1 0.21 and 0.46 \u00b1 0.24 versus 1.00 \u00b1 0.62 mRNA expression level relative to GAPDH, respectively, *P < 0.05). Significantly decreased transforming growth factor-\u03b2 after administration of pirfenidone was confirmed by Western blotting.\nIn our mouse model, intestinal fibrosis can be reliably induced and is developed within 7 days. Pirfenidone partially prevented the development of fibrosis, making it a potential treatment option against Crohn's disease-associated fibrosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f610007774","authors":["Meier, Remo","Lutz, Christian","Cos\u00edn-Roger, Jesus","Fagagnini, Stefania","Bollmann, Gabi","H\u00fcnerwadel, Anouk","Mamie, Celine","Lang, Silvia","Tchouboukov, Alexander","Weber, Franz E","Weber, Achim","Rogler, Gerhard","Hausmann, Martin"],"doi":"10.1097\/mib.0000000000000716","first_seen_on":"2016-02-13T12:18:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1536-4844","1078-0998"],"issue":"3","journal":"Inflammatory Bowel Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1455365896,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/ibdjournal\/Abstract\/2016\/03000\/Decreased_Fibrogenesis_After_Treatment_with.7.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/ibdjournal\/2016\/03000\/Decreased_Fibrogenesis_After_Treatment_with.7.pdf","pmid":"26848518","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"569","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Decreased Fibrogenesis After Treatment with Pirfenidone in a Newly Developed Mouse Model of Intestinal Fibrosis","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/decreased-fibrogenesis-after-treatment-pirfenidone-newly-developed-mouse-model-intestinal-fibrosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7187728,"mean":6.3185455827659,"rank":6195002,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7187728,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320712,"mean":9.6305669091484,"rank":266637,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320712,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1496,"mean":3.2396535117057,"rank":1321,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1496,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":3.7600444444444,"rank":82,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
