The lipid composition of Dermabacter hominis is revisited in this study in the context of its natural resistance to daptomycin, an antibiotic whose activity is influenced by membrane lipids. Thin layer chromatography and mass spectrometry revealed that this species contains phospholipids and glycolipids. Using electrospray ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (exact mass) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, the major phospholipid of Dermabacter hominis was identified as plasmanyl-phosphatidylglycerol (pPG), because it presented one alkyl chain and one acyl chain in the glycerol moiety of the molecule. The structure of the major glycolipid (GL1) was studied by combined gas-liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance, and was established as galactosyl-\u03b1-(1\u21922)-glucosyl-alkyl-acyl-glycerol. Lipid analyses showed differences between one daptomycin-resistant (DAP-R) strain and one daptomycin-sensitive (DAP-S) strain growing in the presence of the antibiotic: DAP-R tended to accumulate GL1 and to reduce pPG, whereas DAP-S maintained high proportions of pPG. The results demonstrate the existence of ether-linked lipids in Dermabacter hominis and reveal a differential distribution of phospholipids and glycolipids according to the sensitivity or resistance to daptomycin, although the mechanism(s) operating in the resistance to the antibiotic remain(s) to be elucidated.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024f1","authors":["Valero-Guill\u00e9n, Pedro L","Fern\u00e1ndez-Natal, Isabel","Marrod\u00e1n-Ciordia, Teresa","Tauch, Andreas","Soriano, Francisco"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.chemphyslip.2016.02.002","endpage":"32","first_seen_on":"2016-02-13T14:15:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-2941","00093084"],"journal":"Chemistry & Physics of Lipids","last_mentioned_on":1481906184,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26867985?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/?term=26867985"],"pmid":"26867985","pubdate":"2016-02-13T22:01:49+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"24","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Ether-linked lipids of Dermabacter hominis, a human skin actinobacterium","type":"article","volume":"196","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/etherlinked-lipids-dermabacter-hominis-human-skin-actinobacterium"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7896890,"mean":6.6848881279648,"rank":5989000,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1059230,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7896890,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":330087,"mean":9.7598699551022,"rank":230758,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":50460,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":330087,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168,"mean":1.8575209580838,"rank":108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.91666666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":2,"Earth and Planetary Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":2,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"ES":1},"mendeley":{"AT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AntibioticResis\/statuses\/698510755386101760","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5531625],"posted_on":"2016-02-13T14:15:16+00:00","author":{"name":"AntibioticResistance","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/551766191962746880\/GlO2QteM_normal.jpeg","description":"Keep abreast of the latest developments in the fight against Antibiotic Resistance #AMR with the latest publications curated from PubMed.
