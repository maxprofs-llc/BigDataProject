Base-catalyzed autoxidation of this compound was shown previously to yield interesting B-ring-modified analogues. Herein is reported a thorough study on this reaction, resulting in the preparation and complete NMR spectroscopic assignments of calonysterone (5) and its previously overlooked desmotropic pair (7), along with two new sensitive metabolites of 20E. The two isomers showed considerable stability in solution. Time dependency of the reaction for yield optimization is also presented; by means of analytical HPLC, the two desmotropes can reach a maximum combined yield of >90%. The activity of these compounds on Akt phosphorylation was tested in murine skeletal muscle cells. Compounds 2 and 5 showed more potent activity than 20E in increasing Akt activation, while compound 7 exerted an opposite effect. As such, the present study provides the first direct evidence for a pair of desmotropes exerting significantly different bioactivities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d8b","authors":["Cs\u00e1bi, J\u00f3zsef","Hsieh, Tusty-Jiuan","Hasanpour, Feria","Martins, Ana","Kele, Zolt\u00e1n","G\u00e1ti, Tam\u00e1s","Simon, Andr\u00e1s","T\u00f3th, G\u00e1bor","Hunyadi, Attila"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jnatprod.5b00249","first_seen_on":"2016-02-13T12:08:32+00:00","issns":["1520-6025"],"journal":"Journal of Natural Products","last_mentioned_on":1455365287,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26465254?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26465254","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Oxidized Metabolites of 20-Hydroxyecdysone and Their Activity on Skeletal Muscle Cells: Preparation of a Pair of Desmotropes with Opposite Bioactiv...  - PubMed - NCBI","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/oxidized-metabolites-20hydroxyecdysone-activity-skeletal-muscle-cells-preparation-pair-desmotropes-o"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7187728,"mean":6.3185455827659,"rank":5408169,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":992645,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7187728,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320713,"mean":9.6305367245376,"rank":222669,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":54080,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320713,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1471,"mean":3.822643537415,"rank":1135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1471,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":4.9214444444444,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
