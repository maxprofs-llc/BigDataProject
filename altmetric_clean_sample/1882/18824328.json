The aim of this study was to improve DH production by a combination of colchicine treatment methods on a sample of five winter and five spring triticale hybrids. Colchicine was applied in vitro either in the C17 medium to induce embryo-like structures (ELS) or in the 190-2 medium for green plant (GP) development. Regenerants which remained haploid were immersed in a colchicine solution either when placed on the medium prior to transferring to soil or when growing in pots, followed by the application or absence of cooling. Colchicine treatment during anther culture affected neither ELS nor GP development, but significantly increased the number of DH plants in comparison to spontaneous chromosome doubling. The highest efficiency was recorded when colchicine was applied in the induction medium (55%) versus the regeneration medium (44.5%) or no colchicine treatment (30%). The effectiveness of chromosome duplication in haploid plants ranged from 32 to 64.5% and it was the highest for the treatment on the medium followed by cooling. Individual hybrids differed regarding their capability of regeneration and chromosome doubling, which were consistent only to a low or moderate extent. However, taken together, winter and spring hybrids did not differ significantly. Combined colchicine application resulted in a high yield of DH production, 82.6% for all triticale hybrids, and can provide a considerable number of fertile DH lines for triticale breeding programmes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b6a","authors":["Aurelia \u015alusarkiewicz-Jarzina","Hanna Pudelska","Jolanta Wo\u017ana","Tomasz Pniewski"],"doi":"10.1007\/s13353-016-0387-9","first_seen_on":"2017-04-15T01:02:05+00:00","issns":["1234-1983","2190-3883"],"journal":"Journal of Applied Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1482235179,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s13353-016-0387-9"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs13353-016-0387-9.pdf","pmid":"28063128","pubdate":"2017-01-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Animal Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Genetics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Genetics & Genomics","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Improved production of doubled haploids of winter and spring triticale hybrids via combination of colchicine treatments on anthers and regenerated plants","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/improved-production-doubled-haploids-winter-spring-triticale-hybrids-via-combination-colchicine-trea"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7912542,"mean":6.6949158185663,"rank":6850406,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7912542,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229058,"mean":12.535154952697,"rank":186306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229058,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":144,"mean":2.2327972027972,"rank":102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":144,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.14,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
