The occurrence of ochratoxin A and aflatoxins (B1, B2, G1, G2) in green coffee beans was studied, using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Apart from mycotoxins, content of ergosterol as a marker indicating fungal occurrence was also determined. Among aflatoxins, aflatoxin B1 was dominant mycotoxin in coffee bean samples with the highest level at 17.45\u2009ng\u2009g(-1) . Ochratoxin A was detected in four samples in the range of 1.27 to 4.34\u2009ng\u2009g(-1) and fungi (potentially producing this toxin): Aspergillus oryzae, Alternaria sp., Aspergillus foetidus, Aspergillus tamarii and Penicillium citrinum were isolated.\nSteaming and decaffeination of coffee beans increased antioxidant activities of brews in comparison to those prepared from unprocessed beans. Although toxins can be quantified in green coffee beans and novel fungi were isolated, their concentrations are acceptable according to law limits.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007ee9","authors":["Jeszka\u2010Skowron, Magdalena","Zgo\u0142a\u2010Grze\u015bkowiak, Agnieszka","Wa\u015bkiewicz, Agnieszka","St\u0119pie\u0144, \u0141ukasz","Stanisz, Ewa"],"doi":"10.1002\/jsfa.8269","first_seen_on":"2017-04-15T01:01:41+00:00","issns":["00225142","1097-0010"],"journal":"Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture","last_mentioned_on":1487062888,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jsfa.8269\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jsfa.8269\/pdf","pmid":"28195330","pubdate":"2017-03-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Nursing","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Positive and negative aspects of green coffee consumption\u00a0-\u00a0antioxidant activity versus mycotoxins","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/positive-negative-aspects-green-coffee-consumptionantioxidant-activity-iversusi-mycotoxins"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8208063,"mean":6.9506291146371,"rank":7102885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8208063,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242265,"mean":12.961074571542,"rank":198421,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242265,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1439,"mean":3.0812378303199,"rank":1018,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1439,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":1.4424705882353,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Positive and negative aspects of green coffee consumption \u2010 antioxidant activity vs. mycotoxins","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1524850764209260&id=543896162304730","license":"public","citation_ids":[18824322],"posted_on":"2017-02-14T09:01:28+00:00","summary":"New article: Jeszka-Skowron M., Zgo\u0142a-Grze\u015bkowiak A., Wa\u015bkiewicz A., St\u0119pie\u0144 \u0141., Stanisz E.
