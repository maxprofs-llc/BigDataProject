We also evaluated factors predicting NIV acceptance and adherence and disease progression.\nProspective randomized study.\noutpatient vs inpatient rehabilitation.\nALS patients.\nALS patients were randomized to two groups for NIV initiation: outpatient vs. inpatient. At baseline (T0), end of NIV trial program (T1) and after 3 months from T1 (T2), respiratory function tests, blood gas analysis, and sleep study were performed. At T1, we assessed: NIV acceptance (>4 h\/night), and dyspnea symptoms (day\/night) by Visual analogue scale (VAS), staff and patients' experience (how difficult NIV was to accept, how difficult ventilator was to manage, satisfaction); at T2: NIV adherence (>120 h\/month) and patients' experience.\nFifty patients participated. There were no differences in acceptance failure (p=0.733) or adherence failure (p=0.529). At T1, outpatients had longer hours of nocturnal ventilation (p<0.02), at T2 this was similar (p=0.34). Female gender and spinal onset of the disease were predictors for NIV acceptance\/adherence failure. There were no between-group differences in progression of respiratory impairment, symptoms and sleep quality.\nEarly outpatient initiation of NIV in ALS is as effective as inpatient initiation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f610007367","authors":["Bertella, Enrica","Banfi, Paolo","Paneroni, Mara","Grilli, Silvia","Bianchi, Luca","Volpato, Eleonora","Vitacca, Michele"],"doi":"10.23736\/s1973-9087.17.04511-7","first_seen_on":"2017-04-14T23:14:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1973-9095"],"journal":"European Journal of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1492211545,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28382811"],"pmid":"28382811","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine"],"title":"Early initiation of nighttime NIV in an outpatient setting.
