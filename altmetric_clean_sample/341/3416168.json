Infestation of snails was documented in five of the eight sites with a mean level of 26.1 p. 100. Level of infestation varied depending on the site. It was highest in secondary irrigation canals (32.8 p. 100), seguias, (34.8 p. 100), and secondary drainage canals (34.8 p. 100). Lower levels were observed in the main drainage canal, (15.2 p. 100). Two infestation periods were noted at two sites in relation with spreading of manure by farmers in autumn and spring. Perennial infestation due to the permanent presence of animal hosts was noted at one. Infestation of drainage canals is enhanced by incoming parasite eggs from upstream irrigation canals. Infestation was age dependent reaching up to 100 p. 100 in older snails of 5.5 mm. Environmental factors such as climatic conditions and human intervention are important to sustaining snail infestation in the oasis of Tozeur.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9243cf058f61000db77","authors":["H Hammami","A Ayadi"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T23:23:05+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0025-682X"],"issue":"2","journal":"M\u00e9decine tropicale revue du Corps de sant\u00e9 colonial","last_mentioned_on":1345381498,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11100443"],"pmid":"11100443","pubdate":"2000-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"[Natural infestation of Lymnaea truncatula Muller by Fasciola hepatica in the Tozeur oasis in southwest Tunisia].","type":"article","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/natural-infestation-lymnaea-truncatula-muller-fasciola-hepatica-tozeur-oasis-southwest-tunisia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627536,"mean":4.9480380313392,"rank":817603,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2286700,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627536,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93632,"mean":8.0228437162906,"rank":24205,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68351,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93632,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":2.2111111111111,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Galba truncatula","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=508127505#altmetric_citation_4","license":"public","citation_ids":[3416168],"posted_on":"2012-08-19T13:04:58+00:00","summary":"Galba (Galba) truncatula is a species of air-breathing freshwater snail, an aquatic pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Lymnaeidae, the pond snails.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=9859981","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Flukeboy","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Flukeboy"}}]}}
