Independent procedures including limited nuclease digestion and differential salt extraction of isolated nuclei showed that a complex containing hOrc1p and hOrc2p occurs in a nuclease-resistant compartment of chromatin and can be eluted with moderate high salt concentrations. A second fraction of hOrc2p that dissociates in vitro at low salt conditions was found to occur in a chromatin compartment characterized by its high accessibility to micrococcal nuclease. Functional differences between these two sites become apparent in HeLa cells that synchronously enter the S phase after a release from a double-thymidine block. The hOrc1p\/hOrc2p-containing complexes dissociate from their chromatin sites during S phase and reassociate at the end of mitosis. In contrast, the fraction of hOrc2p in nuclease-accessible, more open chromatin remains bound during all phases of the cell cycle. We propose that the hOrc1p\/hOrc2p-containing complexes are components of the human origin recognition complex. Thus, the observed cell cycle-dependent release of the hOrc1p\/hOrc2p-containing complexes is in line with previous studies with Xenopus and Drosophila systems, which indicated that a change in ORC stability occurs after prereplication complex formation. This could be a powerful mechanism that prevents the rereplication of already replicated chromatin in the metazoan cell cycle.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Sandra Kreitz","Marion Ritzi","Martina Baack","Rolf Knippers"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m009473200","first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T23:33:10+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1083-351X","0021-9258"],"issue":"9","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1365004791,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1074\/jbc.M009473200","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11102449"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/276\/9\/6337.full.pdf","pmid":"11102449","pubdate":"2001-03-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"The human origin recognition complex protein 1 dissociates from chromatin during S phase in HeLa cells.","type":"article","volume":"276","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/human-origin-recognition-complex-protein-1-dissociates-chromatin-during-s-phase-hela-cells-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631967,"mean":4.9253635474614,"rank":816049,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2293671,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631967,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94373,"mean":8.1082782605012,"rank":24536,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68750,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94373,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28043,"mean":2.6377037301191,"rank":1751,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":10013,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28043,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243,"mean":2.4327851239669,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
