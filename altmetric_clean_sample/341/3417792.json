The recombinases that catalyse these reactions can be grouped into two families by amino acid sequence homology. We describe our current understanding of how these proteins catalyse recombination, and show how the catalytic mechanisms of the two families differ.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036ad","authors":["W M Stark","M R Boocock","D J Sherratt"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-07T00:18:51+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0168-9525"],"issue":"12","journal":"Trends in Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1229416183,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1337225"],"pmid":"1337225","pubdate":"1992-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Catalysis by site-specific recombinases.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/catalysis-sitespecific-recombinases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633255,"mean":4.9221505741186,"rank":815879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295284,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633255,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94648,"mean":8.146693080605,"rank":24569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68989,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94648,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":730,"mean":5.4043840877915,"rank":269,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":730,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":6.4,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
