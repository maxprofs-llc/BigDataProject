A recent study identified mutations within the neurotrophin-4 (NTF4) gene to account for 1.7% of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) in Europeans. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of NTF4 mutations in Chinese POAG patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008ec8","authors":["Vithana EN","Nongpiur ME","Venkataraman D","Chan SH","Mavinahalli J","Aung T"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T22:29:27+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Molecular Vision","last_mentioned_on":1292050551,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20806036","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2927376"],"pmcid":"PMC2927376","pmid":"20806036","pubdate":"2010-09-01T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","ophthalmology"],"title":"Identification of a novel mutation in the NTF4 gene that causes primary open-angle glaucoma in a Chinese population","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-novel-mutation-ntf4-gene-causes-primary-openangle-glaucoma-chinese-population"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3636227,"mean":4.9205935445202,"rank":816768,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295907,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3636227,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94927,"mean":8.1619019025347,"rank":24793,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69040,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94927,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":380,"mean":1.6364432717678,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":234,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":380,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.025,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
