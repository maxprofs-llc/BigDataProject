Serial serum samples from 208 patients in the AT and 199 patients in the ST arm were tested for IgG ab to MUC1 (anti-MUC1 IgG). Anti-MUC1 IgG at weeks 4, 8 and 12 ranked higher in the AT than in the ST arm (p < 0.001). The median (range) area under the curve (AUC) of anti-MUC1 IgG for weeks 1 to 12 was 5.53 (1.51-39.51) and 3.92 (1.17-68.74) for the AT and ST arm, respectively (p < 0.001). An anti-MUC1 IgG AUC > 13 was associated with a benefit in overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in the AT arm in univariate (p = 0.043 and 0.036, respectively), but not in multivariate analysis (Cox proportional hazards regression model). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a benefit in OS and DFS in patients with an anti-MUC1 IgG AUC > 13 in the AT arm (p = 0.043 and 0.036, respectively), but not in the ST arm. A single IP injection with muHMFG1 did not lead to a survival benefit in the randomized trial, but it induced ab to MUC1 that were associated with an improved disease outcome in patients with highest levels of anti-MUC1 IgG. Immunotherapy against MUC1 could be effective in the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61d3cf058f610007841","authors":["Oei, Ang\u00e8le L.M.","Moreno, Mar\u00eda","Verheijen, Ren\u00e9 H.M.","Sweep, Fred C.G.J.","Thomas, Chris M.G.","Massuger, Leon F.A.G.","von Mensdorff\u2010Pouilly, Silvia"],"doi":"10.1002\/ijc.23725","first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T21:47:59+00:00","issns":["1097-0215"],"journal":"International Journal of Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1254136757,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/ijc.23725","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18661524"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ijc.23725\/pdf","pmid":"18661524","pubdate":"2008-07-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Induction of IgG antibodies to MUC1 and survival in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/induction-igg-antibodies-muc1-survival-patients-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629660,"mean":4.9331369641107,"rank":816302,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290671,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629660,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94028,"mean":8.0912391334406,"rank":24360,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68586,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94028,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2407,"mean":3.6335270157938,"rank":417,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":1386,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2407,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":5.751696969697,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
