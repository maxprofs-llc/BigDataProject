Forster plant, commonly known as kava kava. This and other kava-derived ingredients are used as skin-conditioning agents at concentrations from 0.0001% to 0.1%. The Food and Drug Administration issued a consumer advisory in 2002 expressing concern about liver damage in individuals who have ingested kava products. The available oral toxicity data support the concern about liver damage on ingestion but do not resolve the question, for example, whether these ingredients would be substantially absorbed through the skin. Other data needs are described, including toxicology data for yangonin, methysticin, and kavain, which may be present in kava-derived ingredients. Accordingly, the available data are insufficient to support the safety of these ingredients in cosmetics.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002bb6","authors":["Robinson V","Bergfeld WF","Belsito DV","Klaassen CD","Marks JG Jr","Shank RC","Slaga TJ","Snyder PW","Andersen FA"],"doi":"10.1177\/1091581809350934","first_seen_on":"2015-02-07T00:52:54+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"6 Suppl","journal":"International Journal of Toxicology (Sage)","last_mentioned_on":1423243138,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19966149"],"pmid":"19966149","pubdate":"2010-01-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"title":"Final report on the safety assessment of Piper methysticum leaf\/root\/stem extract and Piper methysticum root extract.","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/final-report-safety-assessment-piper-methysticum-leafrootstem-extract-piper-methysticum-root-extract"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4723481,"mean":5.6986316415034,"rank":3349401,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":767612,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4723481,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":165240,"mean":8.8038297133247,"rank":115365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":32085,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":165240,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":188,"mean":4.5608235294118,"rank":138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":188,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":8.2125,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Physics and Astronomy":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/easttowestsc\/status\/563748701160501248","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3418835],"posted_on":"2015-02-06T17:18:58+00:00","author":{"name":"CosmeAsia","url":"http:\/\/easttowestskincare.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1896511230\/Home_page_pic_1_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitter para tratar de assuntos referentes ao blog.
