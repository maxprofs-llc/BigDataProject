Anomalous small-angle X-ray scattering was employed to investigate the key relationship between the structures and storage properties of the involved materials. It was found that the tunable imperfect lattice defects and the 3D pore network in the MOF crystal are the most critical structures for RT hydrogen uptake rather than the known micropores in the crystal, SSA, and Pt catalyst structure.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Cheng-Si Tsao"],"doi":"10.1021\/ja802741b","first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T23:17:14+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1265764316,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/ja802741b","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19140765"],"pmid":"19140765","pubdate":"2009-04-01T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Nanostructure and hydrogen spillover of bridged metal-organic frameworks.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nanostructure-hydrogen-spillover-bridged-metalorganic-frameworks"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3616387,"mean":4.9300280987737,"rank":815285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2277414,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3616387,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92021,"mean":7.1170739404477,"rank":23292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":67656,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92021,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12975,"mean":4.1437943579467,"rank":3492,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":6727,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12975,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":435,"mean":3.0458064516129,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":360,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":435,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
