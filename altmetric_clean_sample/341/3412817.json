Cells were first labeled with 5- and 6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) and then incubated overnight prior to isolating CFSE(+) cells. After 2 more days in culture, more than 90% of the in vivo lymphomyeloid repopulating activity was associated with the most fluorescent CFSE(+) cells (ie, cells that had not yet divided), although this accounted for only 25% of the repopulating stem cells measured in the CFSE(+) \"start\" population. After a total of 4 days in culture (1 day later), 15-fold more stem cells were detected (ie, 4-fold more than the day 1 input number), and these had become (and thereafter remained) exclusively associated with cells that had divided at least once in vitro. Flow cytometric analysis of CFSE(+) cells recovered from the BM of transplanted mice indicated that these cells proliferated slightly faster (up to 5 divisions completed within 2 days and up to 8 divisions completed within 3 days in vivo versus 5 and 7 divisions, respectively, in vitro). FL, SF, and ligands which activate gp130 are thus efficient stimulators of transplantable stem cell self-renewal divisions in vitro. The accompanying failure of these cells to accumulate rapidly indicates important changes in their engraftment potential independent of accompanying changes in their differentiation status.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cba","authors":["R A Oostendorp","J Audet","C J Eaves"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T21:45:21+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0006-4971"],"issue":"3","journal":"Blood","last_mentioned_on":1266182110,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10648396"],"pmid":"10648396","pubdate":"2000-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"High-resolution tracking of cell division suggests similar cell cycle kinetics of hematopoietic stem cells stimulated in vitro and in vivo.","type":"article","volume":"95","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highresolution-tracking-cell-division-suggests-similar-cell-cycle-kinetics-hematopoietic-stem-cells-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629179,"mean":4.9362043867828,"rank":816592,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2289773,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629179,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93953,"mean":8.0734413956064,"rank":24328,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68546,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93953,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6906,"mean":2.7420877624909,"rank":1054,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4363,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6906,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96,"mean":4.6282105263158,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":67,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
