Consequently PK represents an attractive therapeutic target in cancer and human pathogens, like Apicomplexans. The phylum Aplicomplexa, a group of exclusively parasitic organisms, includes the genera Plasmodium, Cryptosporidium and Toxoplasma, the etiological agents of malaria, cryptosporidiosis and toxoplasmosis respectively. Toxoplasma gondii infection causes a mild illness and is a very common infection affecting nearly one third of the world's population.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2010PLoSO...512736B","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Rebecca Bakszt","Amy Wernimont","Abdellah Allali-Hassani","Man Wai Mok","Tanya Hills","Raymond Hui","Juan C.
