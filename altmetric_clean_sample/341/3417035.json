Like many eukaryotic transcription factors, these proteins bind to DNA as dimers. Dimerization is mediated by a structure known as the \"leucine-zipper\" motif. Although Fos\/Jun and ATF\/CREB were previously thought to interact preferentially with different DNA regulatory elements (the AP-1\/TRE and ATF\/CRE sites, respectively), we find that members of these two families form selective cross-family heterodimers. The resulting heterodimers display distinguishable DNA binding specificities from each other and from their parental homodimers. These findings indicate that the Fos\/Jun and ATF\/CREB families of transcription factors are not as distinct as was previously thought. We suggest that they can be grouped into a superfamily of transcription factors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"1991PNAS...88.3720H","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["T Hai","T Curran"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.88.9.3720","first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T23:52:06+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1091-6490","0027-8424"],"issue":"9","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1248107056,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.88.9.3720","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1827203","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC51524"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/88\/9\/3720.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC51524","pmid":"1827203","pubdate":"1991-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Acad Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Cross-family dimerization of transcription factors Fos\/Jun and ATF\/CREB alters DNA binding specificity.","type":"article","volume":"88","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/crossfamily-dimerization-transcription-factors-fosjun-atfcreb-alters-dna-binding-specificity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3990102,"mean":5.0362064143623,"rank":917556,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2528444,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3990102,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124391,"mean":9.0194721956477,"rank":37500,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":85172,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124391,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35326,"mean":14.065023303225,"rank":13984,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":14595,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35326,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":954,"mean":38.892253934942,"rank":592,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":352,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":954,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":11,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":19,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
