Two species of Notiospathius from Brazil originally described in early twentieth century are redescribed, Notiospathius caudatus (Sz\u00e9pligeti) and Notiospathius diversus (Sz\u00e9pligeti). Five new species of Notiospathius from southern Brazil are also described: Notiospathius atrasp. n., Notiospathius johnlennonisp. n., Notiospathius novateutoniaesp. n., Notiospathius sulcatussp. n., and Notiospathius xanthofasciatussp. n. Most of the type specimens of the above new species were collected in the mid twentieth century in the Nova Teutonia region, which is now part of the municipality of Seara in the state of Santa Catarina.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53d3cf058f610004744","authors":["Alejandro Zaldivar-Riveron","Alejandro Zaldivar-Riveron"," Vladimir Salvador De Jes\u00fas-Bonilla"," Juliano  Nunes"," Angelica Penteado-D\u00edas"],"doi":"10.3897\/zookeys.122.1243","first_seen_on":"2015-02-07T00:06:01+00:00","issns":["1313-2970"],"journal":"ZooKeys","last_mentioned_on":1401475358,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3897\/zookeys.122.1243"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/zookeys.pensoft.net\/lib\/ajax_srv\/generate_pdf.php?readonly_preview=1&document_id=2684","pmid":"21998528","publisher":"Pensoft Publishers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"A new synonym of the Neotropical parasitoid wasp genus Notiospathius (Braconidae, Doryctinae), with redescription of two species and description of five new species from Brazil","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-synonym-neotropical-parasitoid-wasp-genus-notiospathius-braconidae-doryctinae-redescription-two"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3821408,"mean":5.02969664561,"rank":876546,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2414873,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3821408,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116585,"mean":9.0183034035547,"rank":34479,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":80773,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116585,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1185,"mean":11.086952702703,"rank":462,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":601,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1185,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":6.7765,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":6}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"BR":1,"MX":2}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"List of organisms named after famous people","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=610825211#altmetric_citation_11","license":"public","citation_ids":[3417421],"posted_on":"2014-05-30T18:42:38+00:00","summary":"In biological nomenclature, organisms often receive scientific names that honor a person.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=10016001","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Jonkerz","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Jonkerz"}}]}}
