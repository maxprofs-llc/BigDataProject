Conflicting data from several studies exist for the association of PTGS2 (cyclooxygenase 2) polymorphisms with breast cancer risk. We investigated associations between common germ-line variations in seven genes in the prostaglandin pathway and breast cancer susceptibility and survival among women with invasive breast cancer in the SEARCH study.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006efa","authors":["Jean E.
