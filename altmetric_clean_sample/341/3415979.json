Crystals of the compound remain intact upon desolvation and show a total H2 uptake of 6.9 wt % at 77 K and 90 bar, which at 60 g H2\/L provides a storage density 85% of that of liquid hydrogen. The material exhibits a maximum isosteric heat of adsorption of 10.1 kJ\/mol, the highest yet observed for a metal-organic framework. Neutron powder diffraction data demonstrate that this is directly related to H2 binding at coordinatively unsaturated Mn2+ centers within the framework.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Mircea Dinc\u01ce,\u2020"],"doi":"10.1021\/ja0656853","first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T23:17:20+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1265764316,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/ja0656853","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17177438"],"pmid":"17177438","pubdate":"2006-12-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Hydrogen storage in a microporous metal-organic framework with exposed Mn2+ coordination sites.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hydrogen-storage-microporous-metalorganic-framework-exposed-mn2-coordination-sites"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634284,"mean":4.9206846148246,"rank":815946,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2296227,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634284,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94728,"mean":8.1494425243069,"rank":24681,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68958,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94728,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12998,"mean":4.0742289759175,"rank":3482,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":6772,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12998,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":439,"mean":3.0990410958904,"rank":73,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":363,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":439,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":17,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":47,"Student  > Ph.
