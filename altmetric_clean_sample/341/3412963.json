Myrosinase and glucosinolates, which are stored in different tissues of the plant, are mixed during mastication generating toxic by-products that are believed to play a role in the plant defence system. Whilst O-glycosidases are extremely widespread in nature, myrosinase is the only known S-glycosidase. This intriguing enzyme, which shows sequence similarities with O-glycosidases, offers the opportunity to analyze the similarities and differences between enzymes hydrolyzing S- and O-glycosidic bonds.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100035d2","doi":"10.1016\/s0969-2126(97)00221-9","first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T21:49:12+00:00","issns":["0969-2126"],"journal":"Structure","last_mentioned_on":1414083169,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/s0969-2126(97)00221-9","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9195886"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S0969212697002219\/pdf","pmid":"9195886","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology","biochemistry"],"title":"The crystal structures of Sinapis alba myrosinase and a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate provide insights into the substrate recognition and active-site machinery of an S-glycosidase.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/crystal-structures-sinapis-alba-myrosinase-covalent-glycosylenzyme-intermediate-provide-insights-sub"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4409947,"mean":4.8306983503683,"rank":982701,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2856494,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4409947,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145142,"mean":7.7082848264792,"rank":39619,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":103720,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145142,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1620,"mean":3.1040605311921,"rank":222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":905,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1620,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":3.9253333333333,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
