Rosenberg from the perspective of one of his former graduate students. It examines the appeal of the integrative quality of Rosenberg's historical approach; his attention to imperfect and inconsistent ideology; his use of graphic examples to shock and engage; his preference for continuity over change; his rejection of nostalgia and romanticism; the influence of his teacher Erwin Ackerknecht; and Rosenberg's response to American health policy issues. The article also places Rosenberg within the history of the rise and fall of American social medicine and assesses the potential influence of his work for twenty-first-century American medical history and health policy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4de3cf058f610001d45","authors":["Naomi Rogers"],"doi":"10.1093\/jhmas\/jrn021","first_seen_on":"2015-02-07T00:44:25+00:00","issns":["1468-4373"],"journal":"Journal of the History of Medicine & Allied Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1234460304,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/jhmas\/jrn021","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18403427"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jhmas.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/63\/4\/423.full.pdf","pmid":"18403427","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"History And Philosophy Of Specific Fields","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Historical Studies","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Arts and Humanities"],"subjects":["historyofmedicine"],"title":"Explaining everything?
