Herein, we investigated the effect of diethylene glycol dibenzoate (DEGB), a dibenzoate-based plasticizer used as alternative to phthalates, on the expression of key genes involved in lipid metabolism and energy balance by using Sparus aurata juveniles as models. We also evaluated the correlation between cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) and PPAR\u03b1 transcriptional patterns in both liver and brain tissues. Exposure to the highest DEGB concentration differentially modulated PPAR\u03b1\/CB1 transcriptional pathways in liver\/brain tissues of seabream. We hypothesize that, at peripheral level (i.e. liver), DEGB acts as PPAR\u03b1 agonist resulting in a potential stimulation of key lipolytic genes and a concomitant down-regulation of endocannabinoid metabolic enzyme genes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027f1","authors":["Paolo Cocci","Matteo Mozzicafreddo","Mauro Angeletti","Gilberto Mosconi","Francesco Alessandro Palermo"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.etap.2017.08.015","first_seen_on":"2017-08-27T10:03:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["13826689","1872-7077"],"journal":"Environmental Toxicology & Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1503834098,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28843100?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28843100?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28843100","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Science And Management","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth","pharmacology"],"title":"Differential tissue regulation of PPAR\u03b1 and CB1 gene transcription pathways by DEGB: preliminary observations in a seabream ( Sparus aurata ) in vivo model","type":"article","volume":"55"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8435952,"mean":7.094002543155,"rank":6400845,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1146747,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8435952,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170529,"mean":12.557625996904,"rank":120779,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":31001,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170529,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":514,"mean":3.590873294347,"rank":344,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":514,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":0.96111111111111,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ReportVet\/statuses\/901746876688433152","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24381027],"posted_on":"2017-08-27T10:03:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Veterinary Report","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/688788078593454082\/1a9Go1Wt_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"ReportVet","tweeter_id":"4821798580","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":10},"tweet_id":"901746876688433152"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/knuksky\/statuses\/901771685371805696","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24381027],"posted_on":"2017-08-27T11:41:38+00:00","author":{"name":"Knuks","url":"http:\/\/youtu.be\/zc7Awva8NFM","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2548442729\/knuks_logo_normal.jpg","description":"\u2605 {nu}s avec l'imagination p\u00e9tulante d'une licorne en chien \u00e7a donne skunk \u2605","id_on_source":"knuksky","tweeter_id":"784373916","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":588},"tweet_id":"901771685371805696"}]}}
