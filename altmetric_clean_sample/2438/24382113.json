In the present study, we have used WI-38 and BJ human fibroblasts as an in vitro model system to investigate the effects of siRNA-based DNMT2 silencing. DNMT2-depleted cells were found to be sensitive to oxidative stress conditions as judged by increased production of reactive oxygen species and susceptible to DNA damage that resulted in the inhibition of cell proliferation. DNMT2 silencing promoted upregulation of proliferation-related and tumor suppressor miRNAs, namely miR-28-3p, miR-34a-3p, miR-30b-5p, miR-29b-3p, miR-200c-3p, miR-28-5p, miR-379-5p, miR-382-5p, miR-194-5p, miR-193b-3p and miR-409-3p. Moreover, DNMT2 silencing induced cellular senescence and DNMT2 levels were elevated in replicatively senescent cells. Taken together, we found that DNMT2 may take part in the regulation of cell proliferation and longevity in human fibroblasts and speculate that the manipulation of DNMT2 levels that limits cell proliferation may be potentially useful anticancer strategy.","altmetric_jid":"5216115a3cf058827c000018","authors":["Anna Lewinska","Jagoda Adamczyk-Grochala","Ewa Kwasniewicz","Anna Deregowska","Ewelina Semik","Tomasz Zabek","Maciej Wnuk"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.redox.2017.08.012","first_seen_on":"2017-08-27T10:38:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["22132317","2213-2317"],"journal":"Redox Biology","last_mentioned_on":1503830273,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28843151?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28843151","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Reduced levels of methyltransferase DNMT2 sensitize human fibroblasts to oxidative stress and DNA damage that is accompanied by changes in proliferation-related miRNA expression","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reduced-levels-methyltransferase-dnmt2-sensitize-human-fibroblasts-oxidative-stress-dna-damage-accom"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8435952,"mean":7.094002543155,"rank":7289396,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8435952,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170515,"mean":12.558630352933,"rank":139524,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170515,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":374,"mean":5.973581769437,"rank":308,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":374,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65,"mean":2.259375,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
