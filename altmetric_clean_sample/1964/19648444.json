Followup occurred 2 years later. We assessed the relation of WSP to odds of knee pain worsening (\u2265 2-point increase in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index pain subscale) using logistic regression, and to odds of incident radiographic knee OA (ROA; Kellgren-Lawrence arthritis scale \u2265 grade 2 of either knee among those free of ROA at baseline) and incident consistent frequent knee pain (CFKP; knee pain on most days during the past month among participants free of knee pain at baseline) in 1 or both knees using multinomial regression adjusting for potential confounders.\nThere were 1752 participants available for analysis [mean age (SD) 67.0 yrs (7.7), body mass index 30.5 kg\/m(2) (5.9), 59% women]. Baseline presence of WSP was not associated with worsened knee pain (adjusted OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.89-1.48, p = 0.30), ROA (adjusted OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.46-1.63, p = 0.65), or incident CFKP (adjusted OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.96-2.96, p = 0.07).\nWSP was not significantly associated with worsening knee pain, incident ROA, or CFKP. Development of knee pain and ROA does not appear to be influenced by underlying WSP.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005aa5","authors":["Lisa C. Carlesso","Jingbo Niu","Neil A. Segal","Laura A.
