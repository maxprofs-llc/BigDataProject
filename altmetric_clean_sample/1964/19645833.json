A number of animal studies have suggested the possible effects of exposure to high noise levels on fertility; to date, a little such research has been performed on humans.\nWe examined an association between daytime and nocturnal noise exposures over four years (2002-2005) and subsequent male infertility.\nWe used the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (2002-2013), a population-wide health insurance claims dataset. A total of 206,492 males of reproductive age (20-59 years) with no history of congenital malformations were followed up for an 8-year period (2006-2013). Male infertility was defined as per ICD-10 code N46. Data on noise exposure was obtained from the National Noise Information System. Exposure levels of daytime and night time noise were extrapolated using geographic information systems and collated with the subjects' administrative district code, and individual exposure levels assigned.\nDuring the study period, 3293 (1.6%) had a diagnosis of infertility. Although there was no association of infertility with 1-dB increments in noise exposure, a non-linear dose-response relationship was observed between infertility and quartiles of daytime and night time noise after adjustment for confounding variables (i.e., age, income, residential area, exercise, smoking, alcohol drinking, blood sugar, body mass index, medical histories, and particulate pollution). Based on WHO criteria, adjusted odds for infertility were significantly increased (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.14; 95% CI, 1.05-1.23) in males exposed to night time noise\u00a0\u2265\u00a055\u00a0dB.\nWe found a significant association between exposure to environmental noise for four years and the subsequent incidence of male infertility, suggesting long-term exposure to noise has a role in pathogenesis of male infertility.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f610006534","authors":["Kyoung-Bok Min","Jin-Young Min"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.envpol.2017.03.069","first_seen_on":"2017-04-27T20:43:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["02697491"],"journal":"Environmental Pollution","last_mentioned_on":1500529036,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28411496","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.envpol.2017.03.069","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0269749116320917","http:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.envpol.2017.03.069","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0269749116320917?via=ihub","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0269749116320917&_version=1&md5=0f5c17cc865c6c9a123d78386be5368b"],"pmid":"28411496","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Exposure to environmental noise and risk for male infertility: A\u00a02population-based cohort study","type":"article","volume":"226","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exposure-environmental-noise-risk-male-infertility-a2populationbased-cohort-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":282.43,"score_history":{"1y":282.43,"6m":282.43,"3m":281.68,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":282.43},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8247986,"mean":6.9694821610306,"rank":21434,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":8226597,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8247986,"percentile":99},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242568,"mean":12.606657368892,"rank":1697,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":240871,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242568,"percentile":99},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2397,"mean":6.4131093489149,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":2390,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2397,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":6.0258888888889,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":90,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":98}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
