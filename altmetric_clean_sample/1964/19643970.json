There is little information regarding depression treatment patterns among adults with MS and depression in ambulatory settings at national level in the United States (US). Objectives. The objectives of this study were to identify patterns and predictors of depression treatment in ambulatory settings in US among adults with MS and depression. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted by pooling multiple years (2005-2011) of National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the outpatient department of the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data. The final study sample was comprised of ambulatory visits among adults with MS and depression. Dependent variable of this study was pharmacological treatment for depression with or without psychotherapy. Predictors of depression treatment were determined by conducting multivariable logistic regression. Results. Out of all ambulatory visits involving MS diagnosis, 20.59% also involved a depression diagnosis. Depression treatment was observed in 57.25% of the study population. Fluoxetine was the most prescribed individual antidepressant. Age and total number of chronic diseases were significant predictors of depression treatment. Conclusion. Approximately six out of ten ambulatory visits involving MS and depression recorded some form of depression treatment. Future longitudinal studies should examine health outcomes associated with depression treatment in this population.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f610004240","authors":["Bhattacharjee, Sandipan","Sandipan Bhattacharjee","Lisa Goldstone","Queeny Ip","Terri Warholak"],"doi":"10.1155\/2017\/3175358","first_seen_on":"2017-04-27T19:48:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2090-2654","2090-2662"],"journal":"Multiple Sclerosis International","last_mentioned_on":1495794367,"links":["https:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/msi\/2017\/3175358\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28536657?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/msi\/2017\/3175358.pdf","pmcid":"PMC5425847","pmid":"28536657","pubdate":"2017-04-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","title":"Depression Treatment among Adults with Multiple Sclerosis and Depression in Ambulatory Care Settings in the United States","type":"article","volume":"2017","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/depression-treatment-among-adults-multiple-sclerosis-depression-ambulatory-care-settings-united-stat-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8272014,"mean":6.980828736602,"rank":6275945,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1118285,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8272014,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243447,"mean":12.628847744469,"rank":171837,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":45386,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243447,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94,"mean":4.2271827956989,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Unspecified":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/857640538715168768","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19643970],"posted_on":"2017-04-27T17:00:13+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":982},"tweet_id":"857640538715168768"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MltplSclppr\/statuses\/868050610611830784","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19643970],"posted_on":"2017-05-26T10:26:07+00:00","author":{"name":"MS Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/599614030790008833\/7IuEjHC7_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"MltplSclppr","tweeter_id":"3262004991","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":212},"tweet_id":"868050610611830784"}]}}
