The purpose of this investigation was to study serum potassium concentration ([K+]) during closed chest cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CC-CPR) in humans. Twenty-two patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) in cardiopulmonary arrest had simultaneous measurement of central venous and arterial [K+] and blood gases during CC-CPR utilizing current advanced cardiac life support protocols and a pneumatic chest compressor and ventilator. Mean arterial and central venous [K+] were 5.0 +\/- 1.3 and 5.6 +\/- 2.9 mEq\/L, respectively, (p greater than .05) with 7 patients having [K+] of greater than 6 mEq\/L. Significant hyperkalemia does occur in some patients during cardiac arrest and CC-CPR. Because poor tissue perfusion during CC-CPR impairs exchange between the interstitial and intravascular compartments, increases in interstitial [K+] would be expected to be even greater. Interstitial hyperkalemia may play a role in the genesis of wide complex electromechanical dissociation (EMD) seen after prolonged cardiac arrest. Since calcium has long been known to be beneficial in the treatment of hyperkalemia-induced dysrhythmias, the success of calcium chloride in treating wide complex EMD may be on the basis of this phenomenon.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d74","authors":["Martin, G B","Nowak, R M","Cisek, J E","Carden, D L","Tomlanovich, M C"],"first_seen_on":"2017-04-27T21:26:17+00:00","issns":["0736-4679"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Emergency Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1493217120,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2786902"],"pmid":"2786902","pubdate":"1989-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["emergencymedicine"],"title":"Hyperkalemia during human cardiopulmonary resuscitation: incidence and ramifications.","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hyperkalemia-during-human-cardiopulmonary-resuscitation-incidence-ramifications"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":5,"6m":5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8083342,"mean":6.8946797770799,"rank":1574674,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6473891,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8083342,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233971,"mean":12.665309475574,"rank":60938,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":172659,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233971,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1809,"mean":6.599607300885,"rank":550,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":1194,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1809,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":4.9538235294118,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
