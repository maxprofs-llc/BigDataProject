However, their frequent use for disinfection in different settings may promote bacterial drug resistance against both biocides and clinically relevant antibiotics. This study analyzes the effects of step-wise exposure to cetrimide (CE) and chlorhexidine (CH) of bacteria from organic foods and previously classified as sensitive to biocides. Gradual exposure of these strains to biocides resulted in mainly transient decreased antimicrobial susceptibility to other biocides and to antibiotics. Biocide-adapted bacteria also exhibit alterations in physiological characteristics, mainly decreased heat tolerance, or gastric acid tolerance in CE-adapted strains, while bile resistance does not seem to be influenced by biocide adaptation. Results from this study suggest that changes in membrane fluidity may be the main mechanism responsible for the acquisition of stable tolerance to biocides.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006625","authors":["Rebeca Gadea","Nicol\u00e1s Glibota","Rub\u00e9n P\u00e9rez Pulido","Antonio G\u00e1lvez","Elena Ortega"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jafc.6b04650","first_seen_on":"2017-02-23T16:57:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0021-8561","1520-5118"],"journal":"Journal of Agricultural & Food Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1496159796,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jafc.6b04650?hootPostID=9db8f2641dcbbd2f86e2065f5c55bafb&","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28177232?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28177232","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Adaptation to Biocides Cetrimide and Chlorhexidine in Bacteria from Organic Foods: Association with Tolerance to Other Antimicrobials and Physical Stresses","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jafc.6b04650","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adaptation-biocides-cetrimide-chlorhexidine-bacteria-organic-foods-association-tolerance-other-antim"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":1.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8290197,"mean":6.9872012989734,"rank":3590275,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4581689,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8290197,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243687,"mean":13.694994780168,"rank":106185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":133397,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243687,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6296,"mean":5.7685782366958,"rank":3285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":2953,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6296,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":6.3278390804598,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":59,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
