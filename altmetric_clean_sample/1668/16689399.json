In the case of acute MI, coronary care units, as presently used, are rather expensive but could be made much more efficient with more effective triage and resource utilization; reperfusion via thrombolysis is cost-effective, as are beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors post-MI in appropriate patients. Cost-effectiveness of CAD screening tests depends strongly on the prevalence of disease in the population studied. Cost-effectiveness of CABG surgery depends on targeting; eg, it is highly effective for such conditions as left-main and three-vessel disease but not for lesser disease. PTCA appears to be cost-effective in situations where there is clinical consensus for its use, eg, severe ischemia and one-vessel disease, but requires further analysis based on randomized data; coronary stents also appear to be cost-effective. In preliminary analysis, ACE inhibition for CHF dominates, ie, saves both money and lives. Cardiac transplant appears to be cost-effective but requires further study. For arrhythmias, implantable cardioverter defibrillators are cost-effective, especially the transvenous device, in life-threatening situations; radiofrequency ablation is also cost-effective in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome apart from asymptomatic individuals; and pacemakers have not been analyzed except in the case of biofascicular block, where results were variable depending on the situation and preceding tests.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005c61","authors":["Joel Kupersmith","Margaret Holmes-Rovner","Andrew Hogan","David Rovner","Joseph Gardiner"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0033-0620(05)80017-9","first_seen_on":"2017-02-23T19:56:21+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["00330620","0033-0620"],"issue":"5","journal":"Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1262304000,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0033-0620(05)80017-9"],"pmid":"7871179","pubdate":"1995-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Cost-effectiveness analysis in heart disease, part III: Ischemia, congestive heart failure, and arrhythmias","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0033062005800179","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/costeffectiveness-analysis-heart-disease-part-iii-ischemia-congestive-heart-failure-arrhythmias-8"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7265962,"mean":6.3657732253142,"rank":1728303,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4602096,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7265962,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92769,"mean":12.778821576406,"rank":30371,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":60581,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92769,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":264,"mean":9.0017870722433,"rank":77,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":264,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":6.36,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
