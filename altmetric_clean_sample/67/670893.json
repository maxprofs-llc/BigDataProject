Six maternal deaths were retrospectively observed in rural southwest Ethiopia. Four of the 6 deaths occurred due to direct obstetric causes. Substandard primary and referral care, not understanding the severity of the problem, and lack of transport were the major themes identified as contributing factors. The result highlighted the need to improving primary health care, to strengthen referral system and community education.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f610007306","authors":["Kebede Deribe","Sibhatu Biadgilign","Alemayehu Amberbir","Tefera Belachew","Kifle Woldemichael"],"first_seen_on":"2012-03-28T17:17:12+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1029-1857"],"issue":"1","journal":"Ethiopian Journal of Health Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1334642428,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3275896\/?tool=pmcentrez"],"pmcid":"PMC3275896","pmid":"22434963","pubdate":"2010-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"College of Public Health and Medical Sciences of Jimma University","startpage":"71","title":"The Road to Maternal Death In Rural Southwest Ethiopia","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/road-maternal-death-rural-southwest-ethiopia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506977,"mean":5.1265981649798,"rank":2283013,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":2194825,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506977,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75968,"mean":4.4296759908907,"rank":32010,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":43441,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75968,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":1.5317391304348,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.35,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
