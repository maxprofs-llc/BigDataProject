Human behaviour is complex; widespread behaviour changes are challenging to achieve. Understanding the dynamics of HIV transmission can not be separated from an understanding of the broader context of poverty, inequality and social exclusion which create conditions where unsafe behaviour flourishes. HIV\/AIDS is not a mere health issue: its occurrence is influenced by a number of socio-economic, cultural and ecological determinants. Social change communication is an inclusive way of responding to HIV\/AIDS issues. Social change communication can tackle structural drivers of the HIV epidemic, with a particular focus on the drivers of gender inequality, stigma and discrimination, and human rights violations. Social change communication is bound to emerge as the vaccine and panacea for HIV and AIDS.\nHIV; AIDS; Behaviour; Social change communication.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8203cf058f61000bc3f","authors":["Haresh Chandwani","Rajesh Gopal"],"doi":"10.4021\/jocmr2009.12.1285","first_seen_on":"2012-04-02T18:11:23+00:00","issns":["1918-3003"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Clinical Medicine Research","last_mentioned_on":1369184792,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3299171\/?tool=pmcentrez"],"pmcid":"PMC3299171","pmid":"22457697","pubdate":"2010-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elmer Press","startpage":"23","title":"Social Change Communication: Need of the Hour for the Prevention of HIV\/AIDS","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/social-change-communication-need-hour-prevention-hivaids"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5041086,"mean":5.964734720803,"rank":687782,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":4351800,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5041086,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78387,"mean":4.7549293496288,"rank":9608,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":68758,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78387,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":211,"mean":1.5205142857143,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":201,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":211,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":10},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":10}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
