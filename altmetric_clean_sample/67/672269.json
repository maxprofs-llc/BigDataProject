It has recently been shown that strain echocardiography can predict ventricular arrhythmias in patients after myocardial infarction. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether strain echocardiography may help in the risk stratification of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with DCM.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005ac0","authors":["Haugaa KH","Goebel B","Dahlslett T","Meyer K","Jung C","Lauten A","Figulla HR","Poerner TC","Edvardsen T"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.echo.2012.02.004","first_seen_on":"2012-03-29T13:55:20+00:00","issns":["0894-7317"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (Online)","last_mentioned_on":1333028750,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22421028?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22421028","pubdate":"2012-03-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Risk Assessment of Ventricular Arrhythmias in Patients with Nonischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy by Strain Echocardiography.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/risk-assessment-ventricular-arrhythmias-patients-nonischemic-dilated-cardiomyopathy-strain-echocardi-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634360,"mean":4.9199904968162,"rank":2739681,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":736735,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634360,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73164,"mean":4.0914374752265,"rank":46809,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":20892,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73164,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":224,"mean":1.7567264573991,"rank":136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":224,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.375,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
