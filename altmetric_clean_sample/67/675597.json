A descriptive study was performed at the cancer institute of a national medical center in Manila on 100 patients undergoing combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy, n = 37, or chemotherapy alone, n = 63. Instruments used were (a) 25-item patient-reported Therapy-Related Symptoms Checklist (TRSC), (b) Self-care Methods (with the 25 TRSC items) tool, (c) Karnofsky Scale, (d) Demographic form, and (e) Health form. The TRSC (Philippine version) Cronbach alpha = .83. The TRSC scores inversely, significantly correlated with nurse-rated Karnofsky measure of functional status (r = -0.45; P < .001)-all evidences of internal consistency reliability, construct, and concurrent validity; similar findings were found in Midwestern United States and 2 other Asian settings. Compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone, patients who had combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy reported more symptoms with greater severity on several TRSC subscales. Self-care methods most used were in 2 categories: (a) diet\/nutrition\/lifestyle change (eg, modify food\/eating habits; eat vegetables and fruits (papaya); use nutritional supplements; have naps, rest, sleep) to manage eating, oropharynx, nausea, and fatigue subscale symptoms; and (b) mind\/body control (eg, prayer, praying the rosary, music) to relieve fatigue subscale, other symptoms. The TRSC (Philippine version) and Self-care Methods assess patient-reported symptoms and patients' self-care use. Oncology symptom management is enhanced by a valid clinical assessment tool.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100057c9","doi":"10.1097\/ncc.0b013e3181b0f2b4","first_seen_on":"2012-04-01T00:48:04+00:00","issns":["0162-220X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Cancer nursing (Online)","last_mentioned_on":1333240736,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/cancernursingonline\/Abstract\/2010\/01000\/Symptom_Monitoring_and_Self_care_Practices_Among.6.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/cancernursingonline\/2010\/01000\/Symptom_Monitoring_and_Self_care_Practices_Among.6.pdf","pmid":"19926978","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"37","subjects":["nursing","neoplasms"],"title":"Symptom Monitoring and Self-care Practices Among Filipino Cancer Patients","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/symptom-monitoring-selfcare-practices-among-filipino-cancer-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":3077805,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":956594,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76209,"mean":4.4741186489607,"rank":47002,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":16011,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76209,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":502,"mean":1.5470578842315,"rank":260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":71,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":502,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.63125,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":1,"ID":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/Cancer_Nursing\/status\/186251263351066624","citation_ids":[675597],"posted_on":"2012-04-01T00:38:56+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Nursing","url":"http:\/\/www.cancernursingonline.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1213998873\/cancer_normal.jpg","description":"CANCER NURSING offers unparalleled coverage of cancer care delivery practices worldwide, as well as groundbreaking research findings and their applications.","id_on_source":"Cancer_Nursing","tweeter_id":"237432406","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":248},"tweet_id":"186251263351066624"}]}}
