A 69-year-old female presented at our hospital with a several month history of dysuria, poor stream, gross hematuria, intermittent blood spots, and a painful mass at the external urethral meatus. The physical examination revealed a soft, small, chestnut-sized lesion through the urethral orifice. The mass was tan colored, ulcerated, covered with necrotic tissue, and protruded from the external urethral meatus. The mass was removed by wide local excision under spinal anesthesia. The pathological diagnosis was malignant melanoma of the urethra. Computed tomography of the abdomen as well as a whole-body bone scan showed no evidence of metastasis. The patient has been free of disease for 6 months postoperatively. We discuss the clinicopathologic features and treatment of this tumor.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8203cf058f61000bc63","doi":"10.4111\/kju.2012.53.3.206","first_seen_on":"2012-04-03T18:50:35+00:00","issns":["2005-6745"],"issue":"3","journal":"Korean Journal of Urology","last_mentioned_on":1333495940,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22468218?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22468218","pubdate":"2012-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Primary malignant melanoma of the female urethra.","type":"article","volume":"53","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/primary-malignant-melanoma-female-urethra-12"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628302,"mean":4.942517914036,"rank":2903984,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75710,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628302,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73440,"mean":4.1628964446683,"rank":52997,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73440,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112,"mean":1.6333693693694,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/AnestesiaF\/status\/187248799033466882","citation_ids":[679311],"posted_on":"2012-04-03T18:42:47+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
