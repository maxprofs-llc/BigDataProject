Theoretically, every technique is applicable to treat any kind of patient. However, it seems appropriate to consider the specific indications and limitations of each of the techniques. To choose the most appropriate treatment method, several issues have to be taken into account. The patient's reason for consulting and clinical condition will define the aim of the treatment. Anatomical and hemodynamic characterization of the varicose veins by means of duplex ultrasound will define the technical feasibility. Although a definitive algorithm still remains to be developed, some of the most important questions that should be included in a decision tree can already be proposed: Is high ligation necessary or at least justified? Is stripping or ablation necessary or at least justified, and in that case, what is the most appropriate technique to be used? All this should help us define a reasonable \"\u00e0 la carte\" treatment for each patient.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f6100084b1","authors":["Olivier Pichot","Marianne De Maeseneer"],"doi":"10.1177\/1531003511433337","endpage":"254","first_seen_on":"2012-03-30T23:08:41+00:00","issns":["1531-0035"],"issue":"4","journal":"Perspectives in Vascular Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1333148509,"links":["http:\/\/pvs.sagepub.com\/content\/23\/4\/250.abstract?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pvs.sagepub.com\/content\/23\/4\/250.full.pdf","pmid":"22237976","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"250","subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Treatment of Varicose Veins Does Each Technique Have a Formal Indication?","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/treatment-varicose-veins-each-technique-formal-indication"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633255,"mean":4.9221505741186,"rank":2015246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":946403,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633255,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73295,"mean":4.0884748274073,"rank":31342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":28268,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73295,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":2.1055555555556,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
