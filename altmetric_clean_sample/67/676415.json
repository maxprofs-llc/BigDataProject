The working hypothesis for the investigation was that presbycusic hearing loss would increase reliance on visual speech information, resulting in better lipreading and auditory-visual integration in older persons who have hearing impairment, compared with older persons who have normal hearing.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100058a1","doi":"10.1097\/aud.0b013e31812f7185","first_seen_on":"2012-04-02T00:27:21+00:00","issns":["0196-0202"],"issue":"5","journal":"Ear and hearing (Print)","last_mentioned_on":1333325840,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/ear-hearing\/Abstract\/2007\/09000\/Audiovisual_Integration_and_Lipreading_Abilities.6.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/ear-hearing\/2007\/09000\/Audiovisual_Integration_and_Lipreading_Abilities.6.pdf","pmid":"17804980","pubdate":"2007-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"656","subjects":["audiology"],"title":"Audiovisual Integration and Lipreading Abilities of Older Adults with Normal and Impaired Hearing","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/audiovisual-integration-lipreading-abilities-older-adults-normal-impaired-hearing-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4770545,"mean":5.7208170586012,"rank":3379220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":777392,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4770545,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77218,"mean":4.693554631752,"rank":48518,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":13371,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77218,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":794,"mean":2.3370844892812,"rank":436,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":794,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":0.83448275862069,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
