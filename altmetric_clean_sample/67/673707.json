The disease has been the subject of intensive research at both the basic scientific and clinical levels, becoming a paradigm for how to understand and treat oncogene-driven carcinomas. Although patients with EGFR-mutant tumours have increased sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), primary and acquired resistance to these agents remains a major clinical problem. This Review summarizes recent developments aimed at treating and ultimately curing the disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f610003168","authors":["William Pao","Juliann Chmielecki","Pao W","Chmielecki J"],"doi":"10.1038\/nrc2947","endpage":"774","first_seen_on":"2012-03-30T14:13:08+00:00","issns":["1474-175X","1474-1768"],"issue":"11","journal":"Nature Reviews Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1333239164,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nrc\/journal\/v10\/n11\/full\/nrc2947.html?WT.mc_id=TWT_NatureRevCancer"],"pmcid":"PMC3072803","pmid":"20966921","pubdate":"2010-10-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"760","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Rational, biologically based treatment of EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rational-biologically-based-treatment-egfrmutant-nonsmallcell-lung-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":1750308,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":2748544,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76293,"mean":4.4238834740208,"rank":21580,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":54575,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76293,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1103,"mean":5.6095136116152,"rank":602,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":498,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1103,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":7.6568571428571,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":18,"Researcher":88,"Student  > Doctoral Student":14,"Student  > Ph.
