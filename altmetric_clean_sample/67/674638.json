Besides their potent innate effector properties, gammadelta T cells have been suggested to be involved in the initiation and maintenance of adaptive immune responses. Here, we investigated the capacity of human gammadelta T cells to induce expansion of virus-specific T cells to Epstein Barr virus (EBV) antigens. Aminobisphosphonate-stimulated human peripheral blood-derived gammadelta T cells (Vgamma2+Vdelta2+) acquired a dual phenotype characteristic for both APCs and effector memory T cells. Coincubation of activated gammadelta T cells pulsed with human leukocyte antigen-restricted epitopes of either the highly stimulatory EBV lytic cycle antigen Bam H1 Z fragment leftward open reading frame or the tumor-associated latent EBV antigen latent membrane protein 2a (LMP2a) with autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes induced selective expansion of peptide-specific, fully functional CD3CD8 cytolytic effector memory T cells. Furthermore, gammadelta T APCs efficiently processed and presented endogenous antigen, as demonstrated by the capacity of LMP2a gene-transduced gammadelta T cells to induce expansion of T cells with broad specificity for various LMP2a peptides. The capacity of autologous gammadelta T cells to induce LMP2a-specific autologous cytotoxic T lymphocytes was confirmed in 2 patients with Hodgkin lymphoma. In summary, bisphosphonate-activated human gammadelta T cells stimulate expansion of cytotoxic effector T cells specific for both subdominant and dominant viral epitopes and thus show promise as a novel source of efficient APCs for immunotherapy of viral and malignant disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cc8","authors":["Landmeier S","Altvater B","Pscherer S","Juergens H","Varnholt L","Hansmeier A","Bollard CM","Moosmann A","Bisping G","Rossig C"],"doi":"10.1097\/cji.0b013e31819b7c30","endpage":"321","first_seen_on":"2012-03-31T04:42:53+00:00","issns":["1524-9557"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Immunotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1333168441,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/immunotherapy-journal\/Abstract\/2009\/04000\/Activated_Human__gamma__delta__T_Cells_as.11.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/immunotherapy-journal\/2009\/04000\/Activated_Human__gamma__delta__T_Cells_as.11.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3176339","pmid":"19242369","pubdate":"2009-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"310","subjects":["neoplasms","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Activated Human [gamma][delta] T Cells as Stimulators of Specific CD8+ T-cell Responses to Subdominant Epstein Barr Virus Epitopes: Potential for Immunotherapy of Cancer","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/activated-human-gammadelta-t-cells-stimulators-specific-cd8-tcell-responses-subdominant-epstein-barr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506977,"mean":5.1265981649798,"rank":3083771,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":968032,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506977,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76441,"mean":4.4071701988487,"rank":47239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":17753,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76441,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":393,"mean":1.3846632653061,"rank":217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":393,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.0653846153846,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
