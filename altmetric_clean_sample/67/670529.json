The complexity of the electronic structure and energy transfer pathways within networks of photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes often obscures the mechanisms behind the efficient light-absorption-to-charge conversion process. Recent experiments, particularly using two-dimensional spectroscopy, have detected long-lived quantum coherence, which theory suggests may contribute to the effectiveness of photosynthetic energy transfer. Here, we present a new, direct method to access coherence signals: a coherence-specific polarization sequence, which isolates the excitonic coherence features from the population signals that usually dominate two-dimensional spectra. With this polarization sequence, we elucidate coherent dynamics and determine the overall measurable lifetime of excitonic coherence in the major light-harvesting complex of photosystem II. Coherence decays on two distinct timescales of 47\u00a0fs and ~800\u00a0fs. We present theoretical calculations to show that these two timescales are from weakly and moderately strongly coupled pigments, respectively.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012NatCh...4..389S","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f610004265","authors":["Gabriela S.
