However, translating evidence-based recommendations into clinical care has proven to be difficult. Several factors-patient adherence, disease complexity, competing medical issues, guideline dissemination, and clinical inertia-are thought to contribute to this problem. In this manuscript, we describe a multidisciplinary ambulatory approach to improve the care of patients with chronic conditions. Our goal was to design an intervention that focused on improving the prescription rates of medications known to reduce cardiovascular-related events and hospital admissions for patients with diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, or stroke. We also describe the critical lessons we have learned in implementing our intervention, including the successes and barriers we encountered during the project.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6133cf058f61000701d","doi":"10.1097\/hpc.0b013e3181bc8074","first_seen_on":"2012-03-28T21:19:08+00:00","issns":["1535-282X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Critical Pathways in Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1332968955,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/critpathcardio\/Fulltext\/2009\/12000\/Improving_Adherence_to_Treatment_Guidelines__A.1.aspx?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/critpathcardio\/2009\/12000\/Improving_Adherence_to_Treatment_Guidelines__A.1.pdf","pmid":"19952547","pubdate":"2009-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"139","subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Improving Adherence to Treatment Guidelines: A Blueprint","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/improving-adherence-treatment-guidelines-blueprint-11"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506977,"mean":5.1265981649798,"rank":3083814,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":968130,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506977,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75968,"mean":4.4271597667408,"rank":46996,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":17591,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75968,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227,"mean":1.5038318584071,"rank":143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.3875,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Psychology":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/CPConlineJrl\/status\/185111331056263170","citation_ids":[671277],"posted_on":"2012-03-28T21:09:15+00:00","author":{"name":"CriticalPathCardio","url":"http:\/\/critpathcardio.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1611379103\/CPC_Cover_-_Twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Official Journal of the Society of Chest Pain Centers","id_on_source":"CPConlineJrl","tweeter_id":"400376171","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":9},"tweet_id":"185111331056263170"}]}}
