The lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of P(NIPAAm- co-NDAPM)- b-PEI in water measured by UV-vis spectroscopy was 38 degrees C. P(NIPAAm- co-NDAPM)- b-PEI as the gene vector was evaluated in terms of cytotoxicity, buffer capability determined by acid-base titration, DNA binding capability characterized by agarose gel electrophoresis and particle size analysis, and in vitro gene transfection. P(NIPAAm- co-NDAPM)- b-PEI copolymer exhibited lower cytotoxicity in comparison with 25 kDa PEI. Gel retardation assay study indicated that the copolymer was able to bind DNA completely at N\/P ratios higher than 30. At 27 degrees C, the mean particle sizes of P(NIPAAm- co-NDAPM)- b-PEI\/DNA complexes decreased from 1200 to 570 nm corresponding to the increase in N\/P ratios from 10 to 60. When the temperature changed to 37 degrees C, the mean particle sizes of complexes decreased from 850 to 450 nm correspondingly within the same N\/P ratio range due to the collapse of thermoresponsive PNIPAAm segments. It was found that the transfection efficiency of P(NIPAAm- co-NDAPM)- b-PEI\/DNA complexes was higher than or comparable to that of 25 kDa PEI\/DNA complexes at their optimal N\/P ratios. Importantly, the transfection efficiency of P(NIPAAm- co-NDAPM)- b-PEI\/DNA complexes could be adjusted by altering the transfection and cell culture temperature.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c4a","authors":["Han Cheng","Jing-Ling Zhu","Yun-Xia Sun","Si-Xue Cheng","Xian-Zheng Zhang","Ren-Xi Zhuo"],"doi":"10.1021\/bc700478s","endpage":"1374","first_seen_on":"2012-04-01T10:42:52+00:00","issns":["1043-1802","1520-4812"],"issue":"7","journal":"Bioconjugate Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1333276526,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/bc700478s"],"pmid":"18627135","pubdate":"2008-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1368","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"\n              Novel Thermoresponsive Nonviral Gene Vector: P(NIPAAm-\n              \n              -NDAPM)-\n              \n              -PEI with Adjustable Gene Transfection Efficiency\n            ","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-thermoresponsive-nonviral-gene-vector-pnipaamcondapmbpei-adjustable-gene-transfection-efficien"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8155227,"mean":6.8925456292622,"rank":4329565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2257266,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8155227,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93775,"mean":5.2551272847484,"rank":44018,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":36796,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93775,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":794,"mean":2.470421185372,"rank":362,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":305,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":794,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.083625,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Ph.
