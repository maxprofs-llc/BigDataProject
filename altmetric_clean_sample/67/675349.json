Here, we investigate whether transcription also occurs and plays a functional role at the mammalian centromere during mitosis. We show the presence of actively transcribing RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and its associated transcription factors, coupled with the production of centromere satellite transcripts at the mitotic kinetochore. Specific inhibition of RNAPII activity during mitosis leads to a decrease in centromeric \u03b1-satellite transcription and a concomitant increase in anaphase-lagging cells, with the lagging chromosomes showing reduced centromere protein C binding. These findings demonstrate an essential role of RNAPII in the transcription of \u03b1-satellite DNA, binding of centromere protein C, and the proper functioning of the mitotic kinetochore.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012PNAS..109.1979C","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Chan FL","Marshall OJ","Saffery R","Won Kim B","Earle E","Choo KH","Wong LH","F.
