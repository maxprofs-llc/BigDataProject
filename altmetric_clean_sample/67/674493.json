Historical literature teaches that ear position is posterior in lambdoid synostosis, whereas it is anterior in positional plagiocephaly. Recently, several cases of anterior ear position in isolated unilateral lambdoid synostosis presented to the Texas Children's Hospital. A review of the cases and literature revealed that there are now 37 cases of unilateral lambdoid synostosis in the literature in which ipsilateral ear position is reported. Twelve cases (32%) had anteriorly displaced ears, 6 cases (16%) were nondisplaced, 7 cases (19%) were displaced posteriorly, 4 cases (11%) anteroinferiorly, 1 case (3%) inferiorly, and 7 cases (19%) posteroinferiorly. Based on this review, it seems that the diagnostic significance of the external ear position is unclear at this point.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a2c","doi":"10.1097\/sap.0b013e3181d6e442","first_seen_on":"2012-03-31T00:38:37+00:00","issns":["0148-7043"],"issue":"1","journal":"Annals of Plastic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1364133516,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/annalsplasticsurgery\/Abstract\/2011\/01000\/The_Variable_Position_of_the_Ear_in_Lambdoid.16.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/annalsplasticsurgery\/2011\/01000\/The_Variable_Position_of_the_Ear_in_Lambdoid.16.pdf","pmid":"20948412","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"65","subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"The Variable Position of the Ear in Lambdoid Synostosis","type":"article","volume":"66","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/variable-position-ear-lambdoid-synostosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":4202164,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78930,"mean":4.6959618897997,"rank":64552,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78930,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1961,"mean":1.039462244898,"rank":1350,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1961,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138,"mean":0.3992700729927,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/AnnalsofPlSrgy\/status\/185885924775829504","citation_ids":[674493],"posted_on":"2012-03-31T00:27:12+00:00","author":{"name":"APSOnlineJrl","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1611398882\/APS_Cover_-_Twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Editor-in-Chief: William C.
