The ICH score accurately risk-stratifies patients in the cohort from which it was developed, but it has not yet been fully externally validated. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the ICH score accurately risk-stratifies patients in an independent cohort.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000427c","authors":["Clarke JL","Johnston SC","Farrant M","Bernstein R","Tong D","Hemphill JC 3rd"],"doi":"10.1385\/ncc:1:1:53","first_seen_on":"2012-04-02T00:39:41+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Neurocritical Care","last_mentioned_on":1333326804,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/16174898\/?i=4&from=\/11283388\/related"],"pmid":"16174898","pubdate":"2003-12-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["criticalcare","neurology"],"title":"External validation of the ICH score.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/external-validation-ich-score"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506977,"mean":5.1265981649798,"rank":3083757,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":968009,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506977,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76200,"mean":4.4514509114292,"rank":47112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":17699,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76200,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":335,"mean":1.8586526946108,"rank":214,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":73,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":335,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.3181818181818,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":8}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
