Compounds 2-13 and 1, which was obtained from the in-house library, were tested for inhibitory activity against sEH. Compounds 1-9, 11, and 12 were shown to have inhibitory activity, with IC50 values ranging from 2.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5 to 53.2\u2009\u00b1\u20094.4\u2009\u03bcM. They were subjected to enzyme kinetic studies to explore the binding mode between the ligand and receptor. Based on our results, compounds 1, 2, 5-9, and 11 (mixed type) and compounds 3 and 12 (noncompetitive type) had a preferred allosteric site. Compound 4 was identified as a competitive-type interaction in the active site. Molecular docking studies revealed the interacting residues and binding energy between sEH and inhibitors. Additionally, molecular dynamics provided detailed information on the interaction between the ligand and receptor.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fd5","authors":["Jo, Ah Reum","Kim, Jang Hoon","Yan, Xi-Tao","Yang, Seo Young","Kim, Young Ho"],"doi":"10.1080\/14756366.2016.1189421","endpage":"9","first_seen_on":"2016-08-25T10:47:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1475-6374","1475-6366"],"journal":"Journal of Enzyme Inhibition & Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1472122402,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27555350?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27555350?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27555350","pubdate":"2016-08-23T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"title":"\n              Soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitory components from\n              Rheum undulatum\n              and\n              in silico\n              approach\n            ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/soluble-epoxide-hydrolase-inhibitory-components-rheum-undulatum-silico-approach"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8276988,"mean":6.9824426364262,"rank":7157805,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8276988,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253534,"mean":12.406185719413,"rank":213583,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253534,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":545,"mean":0.81914705882353,"rank":174,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":545,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.2566666666667,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Tamai_var\/statuses\/768756749390143489","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10815464],"posted_on":"2016-08-25T10:27:46+00:00","author":{"name":"Tamai_rss","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"Tamai_var","tweeter_id":"757179210","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":236},"tweet_id":"768756749390143489"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Tamai_var\/statuses\/768763192298315776","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10815464],"posted_on":"2016-08-25T10:53:22+00:00","author":{"name":"Tamai_rss","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"Tamai_var","tweeter_id":"757179210","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":236},"tweet_id":"768763192298315776"}]}}
