On the other hand, several antibodies are related to cognitive dysfunction. The aim of this study is to assess the cognitive dysfunction of PSS patients via detailed neurologic tests. Moreover, its associations with antibodies were also evaluated.\nTwenty-eight female patients with PSS and 17 healthy controls comprised the study groups. Short-term memory, long-term memory, verbal learning, visual memory, visual spatial perception, attention, verbal frequency function, executive functions and information processing speed were evaluated with neurologic tests in both of the study groups. Furthermore, anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type anti-glutamate-receptor antibody, anti-ribosomal-p and antiganglioside antibodies were assessed in the study groups.\nThe attention, data processing speed, verbal learning, short-term verbal memory and visuo-spatial perception performances were lower in the patients with PSS when compared to the healthy controls. The difference reached statistical significance in Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (P < 0.01), Serial Digit Learning Test (P < 0.01), clock drawing (P = 0.03), Auditory Verbal Learning Test immediate verbal memory (P = 0.01) and Benton Judgement of Line Orientation Test (P = 0.03). Even if antiganglioside antibodies were more likely to be present in the PSS group when compared to the healthy controls, no relationship was found between its positivity and cognitive dysfunction.\nResults of this study suggest that cognitive dysfunction is quite prevalent in PSS patients without being associated with studied antibodies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b9b","authors":["Tezcan, Mehmet Engin","Kocer, Emine Belgin","Haznedaroglu, Seminur","Sonmez, Cemile","Mercan, Ridvan","Yucel, Aysegul Atak","Irkec, Ceyla","Bitik, Berivan","Goker, Berna"],"doi":"10.1111\/1756-185x.12912","first_seen_on":"2016-08-25T13:09:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1756-185X"],"issue":"10","journal":"International Journal of Rheumatic Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1472146253,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27455357"],"pmid":"27455357","pubdate":"2016-07-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"Primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome is associated with significant cognitive dysfunction","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/primary-sj%C3%B6grens-syndrome-associated-significant-cognitive-dysfunction-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.45,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8276988,"mean":6.9824426364262,"rank":3427301,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4842012,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8276988,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253535,"mean":12.406106218495,"rank":96415,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":156779,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253535,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":441,"mean":4.0825136363636,"rank":134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":441,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":2.9107142857143,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
