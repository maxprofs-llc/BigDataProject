The quality of the specimen collection and handling plays an important role in the quality of results, the validity of interpretations, and selection of appropriate course of action. The method of sample collection aids localization of pathology. Air dry but do not heat fix, freeze, or expose films to formalin fumes, temperature extremes, or condensation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008c6e","authors":["Linda M. Vap","Sarah B.
