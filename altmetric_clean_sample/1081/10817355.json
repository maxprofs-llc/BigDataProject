At 12\u00a0months after surgery, 8 of the 12 patients (67%) experienced at least one line of improvement in best corrected visual acuity; 6 of the 12 (50%) improved \u22655 lines and 2 (17%) improved \u22658 lines. After additional grid laser and\/or subconjunctival or intravitreal corticosteroids, the mean decrease in central foveal thickness was 260\u00a0\u03bcm, and the mean total macular volume decreased from 12.10\u00a0mm(3) to 9.24\u00a0mm(3) . Four patients received panretinal photocoagulation to treat either iris neovascularization (n\u00a0=\u00a02) or neovascularization of the retina and\/or disc (n\u00a0=\u00a02).\nAdministration of RTPA via a peripapillary vein using this updated technique provides an alternative or additional treatment option for patients with very low VA after CRVO.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f61000215d","authors":["van Overdam, Koen A","Missotten, Tom","Spielberg, Leigh H"],"doi":"10.1111\/aos.12830","endpage":"744","first_seen_on":"2016-08-25T12:12:20+00:00","issns":["1755-3768"],"issue":"8","journal":"Acta Ophthalmologica (1755375X)","last_mentioned_on":1472126673,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26310993?dopt=Abstract#pubmed"],"pmid":"26310993","pubdate":"2015-12-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"739","subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Updated cannulation technique for tissue plasminogen activator injection into peripapillary retinal vein for central retinal vein occlusion","type":"article","volume":"93","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/updated-cannulation-technique-tissue-plasminogen-activator-injection-peripapillary-retinal-vein-cent"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8276988,"mean":6.9824426364262,"rank":7157775,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8276988,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253535,"mean":12.406117065166,"rank":213573,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253535,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":757,"mean":2.2235158730159,"rank":452,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":757,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":1.1328571428571,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OCTMD\/statuses\/768781104010686465","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10817355],"posted_on":"2016-08-25T12:04:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Brandon Lujan, MD","url":"http:\/\/OCTMD.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/459117248297189376\/n_gr2d1r_normal.jpeg","description":"Medical Retina and Imaging Specialist with Expertise in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT).","id_on_source":"OCTMD","tweeter_id":"244660420","geo":{"lt":37.77493,"ln":-122.41942,"country":"US"},"followers":1320},"tweet_id":"768781104010686465"}]}}
