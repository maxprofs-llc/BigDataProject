Many complications can happen secondary to pancreatic cancer including diabetes, malabsorption, and deep venous thrombosis. Sinistral (segmental or left-sided) portal hypertension (SPH) refers to portal hypertension confined to the left-sided segment of the portal venous system\u00a0namely the splenic side, and the most common etiology is splenic vein thrombosis (SVT). We present here a case of a 66-year-old male with advanced pancreatic cancer who died due to bleeding secondary to SVT. We advise physicians caring for these patients to be aware of this complication, which may also be the manifestation of an undiagnosed pancreatic cancer.","authors":["Saif, Muhammad W","Kaley, Kristin","Lamb, Lynne"],"doi":"10.7759\/cureus.689","first_seen_on":"2016-08-25T10:04:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2168-8184"],"issue":"7","journal":"Cure\u0304us","last_mentioned_on":1472119454,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27555987?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27555987","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Complicated by Sinistral Portal Hypertension","type":"article","volume":"8"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/pancreophil\/statuses\/768750828899430400","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10814836],"posted_on":"2016-08-25T10:04:14+00:00","author":{"name":"pancreophil","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/699064292465864706\/XVzBpUC6_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"pancreophil","tweeter_id":"4911466401","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":217},"tweet_id":"768750828899430400"}]}}
