Bilaspur is located in a subtropical central Indian region. The enrichment factor (EF) values of Pb and Cd, when derived using the crustal and measured soil Fe data as reference, indicated significant anthropogenic contributions to Pb and Cd regional pollution. Based on correlation analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations, it was evident that Pb and Cd in foliar part of Cassia siamea were largely from airborne sources. The SEM studies of leaf confirmed that leaf morphology (epidermis, trichome, and stomata) of Cassia siamea helped accumulate the toxic metals from deposited particulate matter (PM). There is a line of evidence that the leaf of Cassia siamea was able to entrap PM in respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) range (i.e., both in fine and coarse fractions). The overall results of this study suggest that Cassia siamea can be a potential plant species to control the pollution of PM and PM-bound metals (Pb and Cd) in affected areas.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100034e7","authors":["Gajbhiye, Triratnesh","Pandey, Sudhir Kumar","Kim, Ki-Hyun","Szulejko, Jan E","Prasad, Satgur"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2016.08.099","endpage":"130","first_seen_on":"2016-08-25T10:47:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-1026","00489697"],"journal":"Science of the Total Environment","last_mentioned_on":1472120862,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27557456?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27557456","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"123","subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Airborne foliar transfer of PM bound heavy metals in Cassia siamea: A less common route of heavy metal accumulation","type":"article","volume":"573","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/airborne-foliar-transfer-pm-bound-heavy-metals-cassia-siamea-less-common-route-heavy-metal-accumulat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8276988,"mean":6.9824426364262,"rank":7157833,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8276988,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253535,"mean":12.406171298524,"rank":213594,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253535,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5331,"mean":5.0307287054409,"rank":4674,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5331,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281,"mean":7.0332857142857,"rank":229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
