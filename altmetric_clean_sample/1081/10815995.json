This region, named promoter BvcPPOP, and its 5'-truncated versions were fused with the GUS gene and introduced into Arabidopsis, an anthocyanins-producing plant. GUS histochemical staining and quantitative analysis of transgenic plants at the vegetative and reproductive stages showed that BvcPPOP could direct GUS gene expression in vegetative organs with root- and petiole-preference, but not in reproductive organs including inflorescences shoot, inflorescences leaf, flower, pod and seed. This promoter was regulated by developmental stages in its driving strength, but not in expression pattern. It was also regulated by the abiotic stressors tested, positively by salicylic acid (SA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) but negatively by abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellin (GA), NaCl and OH(-). Its four 5'-truncated versions varied in the driving strength, but not obviously in expression pattern, and even the shortest version (-225 to +22) retained the root- and petiole- preference. This promoter is, to our knowledge, the first PPO promoter cloned and functionally elucidated from the betalain-producing plant, and thus provides not only a useful tool for expressing gene(s) of agricultural interest in vegetative organs, but also a clue to clarify the function of metabolism-specific PPO in betalain biosynthesis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e6e","authors":["Yu, Zhi-Hai","Han, Ya-Nan","Xiao, Xing-Guo"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijms161126011","endpage":"27043","first_seen_on":"2016-08-25T10:59:02+00:00","issns":["1422-0067"],"issue":"11","journal":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1472122726,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26569235?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26569235","pubdate":"2015-11-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"27032","title":"A PPO Promoter from Betalain-Producing Red Swiss Chard, Directs Petiole- and Root-Preferential Expression of Foreign Gene in Anthocyanins-Producing Plants","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ppo-promoter-betalainproducing-red-swiss-chard-directs-petiole-rootpreferential-expression-foreign-g"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8276988,"mean":6.9824426364262,"rank":7157805,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8276988,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253535,"mean":12.406133828204,"rank":213583,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253535,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5316,"mean":2.3888067732832,"rank":3906,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5316,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":350,"mean":2.5544183381089,"rank":266,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":350,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
