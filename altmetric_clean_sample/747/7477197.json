Measurement of the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) provides important clinical information, but the procedure is invasive and demands expert skills of the staff.In the present study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between the constant infusion indocyanine green (ICG) clearance, the calculated ICG retention test after 15\u2009min (ICG-r15), and HVPG in patients with different severity of cirrhosis for validation of ICG-r15 as a noninvasive predictor of portal hypertension.\nA total of 325 patients were studied. During a hemodynamic investigation, the ICG clearance was determined using the constant infusion technique and ICG-r15 was calculated.\nAssessment of the diagnostic performance of ICG clearance and ICG-r15 as predictors of HVPG above 10\u2009mmHg was performed by receiver operating characteristic curve analyses.The ICG clearance and ICG-r15 performed well in all three Child classes, with the most significant results among Child class A patients [area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC)=0.832] and less significant results in Child class B (AUROC=0.7448) and Child class C patients (AUROC=0.7392). Only six out of 102 patients in Child class C had HVPG of less than 12\u2009mmHg.\nICG-r15 can be used as an indirect assessment of significant portal hypertension in compensated cirrhotic patients. ICG-r15 may be suitable as a screening tool for the identification of patients for endoscopy and measurement of HVPG.Further validation of ICG-r15 together with other predictors of portal hypertension and its clinical use is encouraged.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f6100058ca","authors":["Pind, Marie-Louise L","Bendtsen, Flemming","Kallemose, Thomas","M\u00f8ller, S\u00f8ren"],"doi":"10.1097\/meg.0000000000000611","first_seen_on":"2016-05-15T12:42:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1473-5687","0954-691X"],"journal":"European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology","last_mentioned_on":1463259897,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27172450?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27172450","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Indocyanine green retention test (ICG-r15) as a noninvasive predictor of portal hypertension in patients with different severity of cirrhosis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/indocyanine-green-retention-test-icgr15-noninvasive-predictor-portal-hypertension-patients-different"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7695064,"mean":6.6060460035168,"rank":6657647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7695064,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269487,"mean":11.450652568222,"rank":225002,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269487,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":930,"mean":3.2874381054898,"rank":778,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":930,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":0.98,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/statuses\/731591149849186305","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7477197],"posted_on":"2016-05-14T21:04:57+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":371},"tweet_id":"731591149849186305"}]}}
