Patients were classified as acute (within 6\u00a0months from the onset of DON) versus chronic (6\u00a0months or more from the onset of DON) DON. The thickness of peripapillary RNFL was compared between eyes with acute and chronic DON and control eyes. Baseline factors associated with visual acuity at the last visit were also analyzed.\nThe mean temporal peripapillary RNFL thickness was thinnest in chronic DON at 66\u2009\u00b1\u200912\u00a0\u03bcm compared to 76\u2009\u00b1\u20098\u00a0\u03bcm in eyes with acute DON and 73\u2009\u00b1\u200912\u00a0\u03bcm in control eyes (p\u2009=\u20090.014). In a multivariable analysis, patients with greater inferior peripapillary RNFL thickness and younger age tended to have better visual acuity at the last visit (p\u2009=\u20090.034, odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20091.038 and p\u2009=\u20090.007, OR\u2009=\u20090.912, respectively).\nOur data revealed a notable difference in temporal peripapillary RNFL thickness in eyes with chronic DON compared to eyes with acute DON and control eyes. We also found a significant association between inferior peripapillary RNFL thickness and visual acuity at the last visit. Thicker inferior peripapillary RNFL thickness was associated with better visual outcome. Further studies with large sample sizes using a prospective design should more clearly reveal the time aspect of the association between the onset of DON and the changes in peripapillary RNFL, and their clinical significance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002982","authors":["Park, Kyung-Ah","Kim, Yoon-Duck","In Woo, Kyung","Kee, Changwon","Han, Jong Chul"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00417-016-3335-9","first_seen_on":"2016-05-15T08:51:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1435-702X","0721-832X"],"journal":"Graefe's Archive of Clinical & Experimental Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1463229760,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27169807?dopt=Abstract#pubmed"],"pmid":"27169807","pubdate":"2016-05-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Optical coherence tomography measurements in compressive optic neuropathy associated with dysthyroid orbitopathy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/optical-coherence-tomography-measurements-compressive-optic-neuropathy-associated-dysthyroid-orbitop"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7695064,"mean":6.6060460035168,"rank":6657637,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7695064,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269487,"mean":11.450749790341,"rank":224996,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269487,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":654,"mean":1.7216814701378,"rank":382,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":654,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":2.9230769230769,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
