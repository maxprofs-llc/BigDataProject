Because infliximab (IFX) showed secondary failure, IFX was switched to adalimumab (ADA). After the third injection of ADA, she was unexpectedly 4-weeks pregnant. ADA was continued until 20 gestational weeks. Remission of the disease activity was maintained during pregnancy, and the birth was uneventful. The ileocecal ulcer disappeared after her delivery. ADA was detected in the umbilical blood after 119 days from the last infusion. The placental transition and timing of neonatal vaccination should be considered in cases of pregnancy with TNF antibody therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61c3cf058f6100077d5","authors":["Keita Fujikawa","Yushiro Endo","Akinari Mizokami","Kosuke Takahashi","Maiko Tabuchi","Kazuo Ohba","Hideki Nakamura","Atsushi Kawakami","Fujikawa, Keita","Endo, Yushiro","Mizokami, Akinari","Takahashi, Kosuke","Tabuchi, Maiko","Ohba, Kazuo","Nakamura, Hideki","Kawakami, Atsushi"],"doi":"10.2169\/internalmedicine.55.6590","endpage":"1378","first_seen_on":"2016-05-15T13:36:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0918-2918","1349-7235"],"issue":"10","journal":"Internal Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1463728181,"links":["https:\/\/www.jstage.jst.go.jp\/article\/internalmedicine\/55\/10\/55_55.6590\/_article"],"pmid":"27181551","pubdate":"2016-05-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1375","subjects":["internalmedicine"],"title":"Successful Treatment with Adalimumab for Intestinal Behcet's Disease during Pregnancy","type":"article","volume":"55","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/successful-treatment-adalimumab-intestinal-behcets-disease-during-pregnancy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7722452,"mean":6.6241115612059,"rank":5563545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1882471,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7722452,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269664,"mean":11.457618442277,"rank":173072,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":80971,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269664,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":911,"mean":2.001021978022,"rank":440,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":424,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":911,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.5353333333333,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":3,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":7,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"JP":1,"GB":1},"mendeley":{"SG":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/kadsho\/statuses\/731635330894286849","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7477808],"posted_on":"2016-05-15T00:00:30+00:00","author":{"name":"\u9580\u6751\u5c06\u592a Hosp Pharmacist","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/778806726757748737\/QcGpyRcy_normal.jpg","description":"PIC(JSHP)\/IDCP(JSC)\/CNP(JSNP)\/\u85ac\u7269\u7642\u6cd5\u5c02\u9580\u85ac\u5264\u5e2b(JSPHCS) #PharmaceuticalCare, #ClinicalPharmacy, #DI, #Pharmacoepidemiology, #EBM, #AntimicrobialStewardship #ASP","id_on_source":"kadsho","tweeter_id":"168488514","geo":{"lt":43.06417,"ln":141.34694,"country":"JP"},"followers":2129},"tweet_id":"731635330894286849"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/sweetsfiend\/statuses\/733555275139944448","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7477808],"posted_on":"2016-05-20T07:09:41+00:00","author":{"name":"Michelle Holder","url":"https:\/\/helpforsweetssyndromeuk.wordpress.com\/about\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/601001481349783553\/qmKSCR44_normal.png","description":"Helping those with the rare autoinflammatory condition & neutrophilic dermatosis, Sweet's syndrome | Administrator & Researcher for Sweet's Syndrome UK","id_on_source":"sweetsfiend","tweeter_id":"955817893","geo":{"lt":51.48,"ln":-3.18,"country":"GB"},"followers":347},"tweet_id":"733555275139944448"}]}}
