To address that, ventral skins of miniature pigs were treated over a 10-day or 21-day period, with continuous suction at -50\u2009mm Hg via a 7-cm diameter rubber-lined suction-cup device. Soft tissue thickness increased immediately after this external volume expansion (EVE) treatment, such increase completely disappeared by the next day. In the dermis and subcutaneous fat, the EVE treated groups showed significant increases in blood vessel density evident by CD31 staining as well as in vascular networks layered with smooth muscle cells when compared with the control group. This finding was corroborated by the increased percentage of endothelial cells present in the treatment groups. There was no significant difference in the percentages of proliferating basal keratinocytes or adipocytes, nor in epidermal thickness. Moreover, the EVE had no effect on proliferation or differentiation potential of adipose stem cells. Taken together, the major effects of EVE appeared to be vascular remodeling and maturation of functional blood vessels. This understanding may help clinicians optimize the vascularity of the recipient bed to further improve fat graft survival.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Kao, Huang-Kai","Hsu, Hsiang-Hao","Chuang, Wen-Yu","Chen, Sheng-Chih","Chen, Bin","Wu, Shinn-Chih","Guo, Lifei","Huang-Kai Kao","Hsiang-Hao Hsu","Wen-Yu Chuang","Sheng-Chih Chen","Bin Chen","Shinn-Chih Wu","Lifei Guo"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep25865","first_seen_on":"2016-05-15T07:30:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1463223419,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27174509?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1038\/srep25865"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep25865.pdf","pmid":"27174509","pubdate":"2016-05-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Tissue engineering","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Translational research","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"25865","subjects":["science"],"title":"External Volume Expansion Modulates Vascular Growth and Functional Maturation in a Swine Model","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/external-volume-expansion-modulates-vascular-growth-functional-maturation-swine-model"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7695064,"mean":6.6060460035168,"rank":3986075,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2163065,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7695064,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269487,"mean":11.450776878947,"rank":146377,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":96734,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269487,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30254,"mean":14.925813638317,"rank":17986,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":9328,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30254,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3033,"mean":14.238559366755,"rank":1751,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":967,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3033,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
