Although there are some hints that HHT has anti-aggregatory effects, to date, it has neither been shown to have any specific pathological relevance nor is there much information about its physiological role. This review presents a summary of the physicochemical properties of HHT, its chemical synthesis, the impact of various biological systems on its enzymatic and non-enzymatic production and its physiological function and metabolization, as well as a survey of the most important methods for analyzing this unsaturated hydroxy-fatty acid. Due to the low antibody-raising potency expected in HHT, no immunological system for HHT quantification has been developed so far. In our report we present the development and validation of a sensitive and reliable, competitive radioimmunoassay (RIA) suitable for the quantitative determination of HHT. HHT was produced by an enhanced enzymatic method using platelet-rich plasma (PRP). With an effective and modified liquid-liquid and solid-phase extraction method we were able to produce highly purified HHT (97% purity by GC\/MS) in sub-milligram ranges. These fractions were used for the synthesis of BSA-antigen-conjugates and for immunization of rabbits. The tritiated tracer was synthesized using prostaglandin H synthase for the production of prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) followed by an aqueous reaction with Fe(2+)-solution to rear-range PGH2 to HHT. The dynamic range of the assay was from 30-400 pg\/tube, with a sensitivity of approximately 40 pg\/tube. The evaluation of the assay was performed by a HPLC-RIA method as well as by correlation with a quantitative HPLC method and correlation with TXB2 concentrations in a blood coagulation study. The assay may be useful for the quantification of HHT in several tissues and body fluids under various physiological conditions and may also help to understand the possible physiological role of HHT in biological processes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033c4","authors":["John, H","Cammann, K","Schlegel, W"],"first_seen_on":"2016-05-15T14:21:27+00:00","issns":["1098-8823"],"issue":"2-3","journal":"Prostaglandins & Other Lipid Mediators","last_mentioned_on":1467119188,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9785378"],"pmid":"9785378","pubdate":"1998-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Development and review of radioimmunoassay of 12-S-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid.","type":"article","volume":"56","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-review-radioimmunoassay-12shydroxyheptadecatrienoic-acid"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7958342,"mean":6.7226589717569,"rank":1965210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4901359,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7958342,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271294,"mean":11.482607859399,"rank":87327,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":179925,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271294,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145,"mean":2.6666527777778,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
