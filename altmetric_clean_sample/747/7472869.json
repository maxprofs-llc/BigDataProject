Conventionally bred maize hybrids with high provitamin A carotenoid concentrations may have the potential to improve vitamin A status in maize-consuming populations.\nWe evaluated the efficacy of regular provitamin A carotenoid-biofortified \"orange\" maizemeal (\u223c15 \u03bcg \u03b2-carotene\/g) consumption in improving vitamin A status and reducing vitamin A deficiency in children.\nThis was a cluster-randomized controlled trial in the rural farming district of Mkushi, Zambia. All 4- to 8-y-old children in an \u223c400-km(2) area were identified and grouped by proximity into clusters of \u223c15-25 children. We randomly assigned clusters to 1) orange maizemeal (n = 25), 2) white maizemeal (n = 25), or 3) a parallel, nonintervention group (n = 14). Children in intervention clusters (n = 1024) received 200 g maizemeal for 6 d\/wk over 6 mo; the maizemeal was prepared according to standardized recipes and served in cluster-level kitchens. Staff recorded attendance and leftovers. We collected venous blood before and after the intervention to measure serum retinol, \u03b2-carotene, C-reactive protein, and \u03b11-acid glycoprotein.\nIntervention groups were comparable at baseline, and vitamin A status was better than anticipated (12.1% deficient on the basis of serum retinol <0.7 \u03bcmol\/L). Although attendance at meals did not differ (85%), median daily maize intake was higher in white (154 g\/d) than in orange (142 g\/d) maizemeal clusters. At follow-up, mean serum \u03b2-carotene was 0.14 \u03bcmol\/L (95% CI: 0.09, 0.20 \u03bcmol\/L) higher in orange maizemeal clusters (P < 0.001), but mean serum retinol (1.00 \u00b1 0.33 \u03bcmol\/L overall) and deficiency prevalence (17.1% overall) did not differ between arms.\nIn this marginally nourished population, regular biofortified maizemeal consumption increased serum \u03b2-carotene concentrations but did not improve serum retinol. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01695148.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005700","authors":["Palmer, Amanda C","Siamusantu, Ward","Chileshe, Justin","Schulze, Kerry J","Barffour, Maxwell","Craft, Neal E","Molobeka, Ngosa","Kalungwana, Ng'andwe","Arguello, Margia A","Mitra, Maithilee","Caswell, Bess","Klemm, Rolf Dw","West, Keith P","Amanda C Palmer","Ward Siamusantu","Justin Chileshe","Kerry J Schulze","Maxwell Barffour","Neal E Craft","Ngosa Molobeka","Ng\u2019andwe Kalungwana","Margia A Arguello","Maithilee Mitra","Bess Caswell","Rolf DW Klemm","Keith P West"],"doi":"10.3945\/ajcn.116.132571","first_seen_on":"2016-05-15T09:15:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1938-3207","0002-9165"],"journal":"American Journal of Clinical Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1467393971,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27169838?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/ajcn.nutrition.org\/content\/104\/1\/181.short?rss=1&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27169838","pubdate":"2016-05-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Provitamin A-biofortified maize increases serum \u00a0-carotene, but not retinol, in marginally nourished children: a cluster-randomized trial in rural Zambia","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/provitamin-abiofortified-maize-increases-serum-%CE%B2carotene-not-retinol-marginally-nourished-children-c"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7974292,"mean":6.7330879653071,"rank":3682924,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4259375,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7974292,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271538,"mean":11.481886210719,"rank":121997,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":147720,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271538,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5868,"mean":25.434897221749,"rank":4266,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":1592,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5868,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":55.579367088608,"rank":66,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
