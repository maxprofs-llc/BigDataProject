In this study, the authors compared the effects of desflurane on facial motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from the spasm and nonspasm sides of patients who were undergoing microvascular decompression (MVD) surgery to test the hypothesis that HFS is associated with a central elevation of facial motor neuron excitability. METHODS Facial MEPs were elicited in 31 patients who were undergoing MVD for HFS and were administered total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with or without additional desflurane, an inhaled anesthetic known to centrally suppress MEPs. All measurements were completed before dural opening while a consistent mean arterial blood pressure was maintained and electroencephalography was performed. The activation threshold voltage and mean amplitudes of the MEPs from both sides of the face were compared. RESULTS There was a significantly lower mean activation threshold of facial MEPs on the spasm side than on the nonspasm side (mean \u00b1 SD 162.9 \u00b1 10.1 vs 198.3 \u00b1 10.1 V, respectively; p = 0.01). In addition, MEPs were also elicited more readily when single-pulse transcranial electrical stimulation was used on the spasm side (74% vs 31%, respectively; p = 0.03). Although desflurane (1 minimum alveolar concentration) suppressed facial MEPs on both sides, the suppressive effects of desflurane were less on the spasm side than on the nonspasm side (59% vs 79%, respectively; p = 0.03), and M waves recorded from the mentalis muscle remained unchanged, which indicates that desflurane did not affect the peripheral facial nerve or neuromuscular junction. CONCLUSIONS Centrally acting inhaled anesthetic agents can suppress facial MEPs and therefore might interfere with intraoperative monitoring. The elevated motor neuron excitability and differential effects of desflurane between the spasm and nonspasm sides support a mechanism of central pathophysiology in HFS.
