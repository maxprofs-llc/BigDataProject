Ten consecutive patients were considered for this surgical therapy and form the basis of this communication. The patients were treated by a combination of methods including bilateral ex vivo reconstruction, unilateral in situ and contralateral ex vivo reconstruction, and unilateral ex vivo reconstruction and contralateral nephrectomy. Replacement of the diseased segment of the renal artery in all ex vivo reconstruction consisted of arterial autografts including hypogastric artery, splenic artery, common iliac, and external iliac artery. In the ex vivo reconstruction, the ureter was either left intact or was transected and reconstructed by standard ureterovesicle implantation. After surgery all patients became normotensive without antihypertensive medication. Although this is a relatively small series, the uniform good results in these patients with extensive disease suggest that ex vivo renal artery reconstruction is a safe and effective method of treatment. Thus, it should be more widely applicable, expecially in those patients with renal vascular disease who were previously thought to be inoperable or eligible for nephrectomy only.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a30","authors":["F O Belzer","O Salvatierra","A Palubinskas","R J Stoney","Belzer, F O","Salvatierra, O","Palubinskas, A","Stoney, R J"],"first_seen_on":"2016-05-15T07:04:05+00:00","issns":["0003-4932"],"issue":"4","journal":"Annals of Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1463322756,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1344011\/pdf\/annsurg00284-0114.pdf","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1180583","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1344011"],"pdf_url":"\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1344011\/pdf\/annsurg00284-0114.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1344011","pmid":"1180583","pubdate":"1975-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Lippincott, Williams, and Wilkins","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"456","subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Ex vivo renal artery reconstruction.","type":"article","volume":"182"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7700406,"mean":6.6097173252523,"rank":1874674,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4802192,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7700406,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269532,"mean":11.452361049378,"rank":86843,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":178915,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269532,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4088,"mean":9.9251098605334,"rank":1739,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":1670,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4088,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104,"mean":18.834737864078,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Fibromuscular dysplasia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=720205160#altmetric_citation_381ddd29-8727-4f42-8a5a-6f1e21b4451e","license":"public","citation_ids":[7470930,7470930,7470930],"posted_on":"2016-05-14T10:27:59+00:00","summary":"Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a non-atherosclerotic, non-inflammatory disease of the blood vessels that causes abnormal growth within the wall of an artery.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=4350672","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Rjwilmsi","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Rjwilmsi"}},{"title":"Ex vivo reconstruction","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=720380714#altmetric_citation_7d810504-b5db-4b45-9e27-2c953328817f","license":"public","citation_ids":[7470930,7470930,7470930],"posted_on":"2016-05-15T14:32:36+00:00","summary":"Ex vivo reconstruction, short for ex vivo renal artery reconstruction and autotransplantation, is a technique mainly used for complex disease involving multiple segmental branches in patients with fibromuscular dysplasia.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=44897758","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Rjwilmsi","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Rjwilmsi"}}]}}
