PM"],"citation":{"abstract":"The cornea is a transparent tissue that lacks blood and lymphatic vessels. In addition, the cornea is readily accessible, which makes it convenient for direct visualization of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. The corneal micropocket assay is a commonly used quantitative technique, in which a growth factor containing pellet is micro-surgically implanted into the cornea of a rodent. Subsequently, the growth of the preexisting limbal vessels toward the growth factor is visualized by live microscopy or immunohistochemistry. Recently, there has been significant interest in the process of lymphangiogenesis and the factors that regulate it. To facilitate these studies, we introduce a novel technique for visualization of the immune response during growth factor induced angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in the cornea.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd3b","authors":["Nakao, Shintaro","Hafezi-Moghadam, Ali"],"doi":"10.1007\/978-1-4939-3628-1_21","first_seen_on":"2016-05-15T11:09:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1940-6029","1064-3745"],"journal":"Methods in molecular biology","last_mentioned_on":1463249601,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27172963?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27172963","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Angiogenesis Protocols","type":"article","volume":"1430","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/corneal-micropocket-assay-model-angiogenesis-lymphangiogenesis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7695064,"mean":6.6060460035168,"rank":6657644,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7695064,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269488,"mean":11.450620096702,"rank":225001,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269488,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5464,"mean":1.8834105802673,"rank":3861,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5464,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":2.0925,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/VEGFRSSfeeds\/statuses\/731547968910721024","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7475706],"posted_on":"2016-05-14T18:13:21+00:00","author":{"name":"VEGF RSS Feeds","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/516588600\/VEGF_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"VEGFRSSfeeds","tweeter_id":"88511740","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":363},"tweet_id":"731547968910721024"}]}}
