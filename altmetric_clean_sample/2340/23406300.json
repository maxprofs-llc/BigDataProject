Demographic and radiographic data of children with closed reduction and casting of these fractures in the emergency department were evaluated. Of 174 patients with adequate follow-up to union, 19 (11%) required a repeat procedure. Risk factors for repeat reduction included translation of 50% or more in any plane, age more than 9 years, complete fracture of the radius, and follow-up angulation of the radius more than 15\u00b0 on lateral radiographs or of the ulna more than 10\u00b0 on anteroposterior radiographs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dd5","authors":["Kutsikovich, Jeffrey I.","Hopkins, Christopher M.","Gannon, Edwin W.
