The expansion of TAVR into the low-risk patient population will largely depend on its durability outcomes due to the high life expectancy in low-risk patients. Long-term follow-up results from low-risk clinical trials will take several years to be reported. Given this, we performed a systematic review of current long-term data to provide further insights into TAVR durability and long-term patient survival. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Google Scholar, BIOSIS, and major conference abstracts for TAVR studies with follow-up of at least 4\u00a0years. Abstracts were retrieved and independently reviewed for eligibility. Final studies were selected irrespective of the type of TAVR valve, route of vascular access, or surgical risk profile. A total of 12\u00a0studies met the inclusion criteria. We reviewed data from these studies with emphasis on long-term survival and echocardiographic findings.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021f0","authors":["Arora, Sameer","Ramm, Cassandra J.","Strassle, Paula D.","Vaidya, Satyanarayana R.","Caranasos, Thomas G.","Vavalle, John P."],"doi":"10.1016\/j.amjcard.2017.04.029","first_seen_on":"2017-08-04T07:20:52+00:00","issns":["0002-9149","00029149"],"journal":"American Journal of Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1501459200,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.amjcard.2017.04.029"],"pmid":"28532778","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Review of Major Registries and Clinical Trials of Late Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/review-major-registries-clinical-trials-late-outcomes-after-transcatheter-aortic-valve-replacement"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8296422,"mean":6.9913019303065,"rank":4415356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2309734,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8296422,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":162649,"mean":11.415830554326,"rank":88557,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":58125,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":162649,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4342,"mean":4.9071260078323,"rank":2476,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1514,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4342,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":4.4877,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
