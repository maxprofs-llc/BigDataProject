Questionnaire-based interviews with mothers of participants were performed and maternal medical records during pregnancy were reviewed. The questionnaire investigated basic information, personal history, environmental exposure, exposure to maternal diseases, symptoms and corresponding medical treatments during pregnancy, and parental socioeconomic status. The case and control participants were matched for sex, birth weight, gestational age, and parental socioeconomic status level. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted with ED as the main outcome variable.ResultsFactors significantly associated with ED were: history of maternal inevitable miscarriage (odds ratio (OR), 2.59; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.13-5.90), common cold in the first trimester (OR, 3.94; CI, 1.74-8.93), and paternal smoke exposure >half a pack per day during pregnancy (OR, 4.81; CI, 1.74-13.28).ConclusionHistory of maternal miscarriage, common cold exposure in the first trimester, and paternal smoking (>half a pack per day) during pregnancy could result in significant risk factors for ED of newborns. These data also imply that paternal smoking delivers nicotine to maternal respiratory system and uterine microenvironment that may both affect microvascular development and predispose the fetus to future ED.Eye advance online publication, 24 March 2017; doi:10.1038\/eye.2017.40.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028a1","authors":["S Wu","Y Fan","D Wu","J Hong","J Xu"],"doi":"10.1038\/eye.2017.40","endpage":"1105","first_seen_on":"2017-08-04T03:44:37+00:00","issns":["0950-222X","1476-5454"],"journal":"Eye","last_mentioned_on":1501688100,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/eye\/journal\/v31\/n7\/abs\/eye201740a.html"],"pmid":"28338666","pubdate":"2017-03-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Risk factors","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Corneal diseases","scheme":"npg"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1099","subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"The association of maternal factors with epibulbar dermoid of newborn: a retrospective, matched case\u2013control study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-maternal-factors-epibulbar-dermoid-newborn-retrospective-matched-casecontrol-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8314034,"mean":7.0059620328577,"rank":7188629,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8314034,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171769,"mean":11.688372595594,"rank":140419,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171769,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1386,"mean":2.9201732851986,"rank":1020,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1386,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":5.4583333333333,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Eye - Abstract of article: The association of maternal factors with epibulbar dermoid of newborn: a retrospective, matched case-control study","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1272919519501370&id=875216145938378","license":"public","citation_ids":[23403673],"posted_on":"2017-08-02T15:35:00+00:00","summary":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/eye\/journal\/v31\/n7\/abs\/eye201740a.html","author":{"name":"Oculoplastic Surgery Journal Club","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/875216145938378","facebook_wall_name":"Oculoplastic Surgery Journal Club","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/875216145938378\/picture","id_on_source":"875216145938378"}}]}}
