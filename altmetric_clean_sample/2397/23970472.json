However, possible integrations between drought conditions and those responses have not received much focus, especially regarding crop plants, and the relationship between abiotic stress and the diurnal cycle is generally not considered. Therefore, we conducted a genome-wide analysis to identify genes showing both diurnal regulation and water-deficiency response in rice (Oryza sativa). Among the 712 drought-responsive genes primary identified, 56.6% are diurnally expressed while 47.6% of the 761 that are down-regulated by drought are also diurnal. Using the \u03b2-glucuronidase reporter system and qRT-PCR analyses, we validated expression patterns of two candidate genes, thereby supporting the reliability of our transcriptome data. MapMan analysis indicated that diurnal genes up-regulated by drought are closely associated with the starch-sucrose pathway while those that are down-regulated are involved in photosynthesis. We then confirmed that starch-sucrose contents and chlorophyll fluorescence are altered in a diurnal manner under drought stress, suggesting these metabolic diurnal alterations as a novel indicator to evaluate the drought response in rice leaves. We constructed a functional gene network associated with the starch-sucrose KEGG metabolic pathway for further functional studies, and also developed a regulatory pathway model that includes OsbZIP23 transcription factor.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Kim, Seo-Woo","Lee, Sang-Kyu","Jeong, Hee-Jeong","An, Gynheung","Jeon, Jong-Seong","Jung, Ki-Hong"],"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-017-08473-1","first_seen_on":"2017-08-17T13:16:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["2045-2322"],"issue":"1","journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1502985651,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28811563?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28811563","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28811563?dopt=Abstractu0026utm_source=dlvr.itu0026utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28811563","publisher":"Springer Nature","subjects":["science"],"title":"Crosstalk between diurnal rhythm and water stress reveals an altered primary carbon flux into soluble sugars in drought-treated rice leaves","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/crosstalk-between-diurnal-rhythm-water-stress-reveals-altered-primary-carbon-flux-soluble-sugars-dro"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8389481,"mean":7.0670107241375,"rank":6366781,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1137777,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8389481,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167655,"mean":12.751549011655,"rank":119142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":30064,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167655,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37266,"mean":14.711516221656,"rank":26874,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":6245,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37266,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3712,"mean":13.234724333064,"rank":2605,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":760,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3712,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
