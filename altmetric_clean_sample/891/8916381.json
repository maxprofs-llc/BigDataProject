To characterize the resistance mechanisms in poplar tree against Apripona germari, comprehensive metabolomic changes of poplar bark and xylem in response to A. germari infection were examined by gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF\/MS). It was found that, four days after feeding (stage I), A. germari infection brought about changes in various metabolites, such as phenolics, amino acids and sugars in both bark and xylem. Quinic acid, epicatechin, epigallocatechin and salicin might play a role in resistance response in bark, while coniferyl alcohol, ferulic acid and salicin contribute resistance in xylem. At feeding stages II when the larvae fed for more than one month, fewer defensive metabolites were induced, but levels of many intermediates of glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were reduced, especially in xylem. These results suggested that the defense strategies against A. germari might depend mainly on the early defense responses in poplar. In addition, it was found that bark and xylem in infected trees accumulated higher levels of salicylic acid and 4-aminobutyric acid, respectively, these tissues displaying a direct and systemic reaction against A. germari. However, the actual role of the two metabolites in A. germari-induced defense in poplar requires further investigation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e6e","authors":["Lijuan Wang","Wang, Lijuan","Qu, Liangjian","Zhang, Liwei","Hu, Jianjun","Tang, Fang","Lu, Mengzhu"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijms17060923","first_seen_on":"2016-06-20T13:16:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1422-0067"],"issue":"6","journal":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1466687025,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/17\/6\/923","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27331808?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/17\/6\/923\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4926456","pmid":"27331808","pubdate":"2016-06-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Metabolic Responses of Poplar to Apripona germari (Hope) as Revealed by Metabolite Profiling","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metabolic-responses-poplar-apripona-germari-hope-revealed-metabolite-profiling"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7936934,"mean":6.7106933012983,"rank":3934253,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3800469,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7936934,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262632,"mean":11.539348195757,"rank":130667,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":121318,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262632,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4994,"mean":2.279166833567,"rank":1492,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3178,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4994,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":374,"mean":1.9607935656836,"rank":119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":374,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
