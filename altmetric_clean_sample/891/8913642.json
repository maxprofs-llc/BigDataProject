Our objectives were to evaluate formally the national performance of these melanoma measures and to examine patient, tumor, and hospital characteristics associated with adherence.\nFrom the National Cancer Data Base (2012), patients with invasive, nonmetastatic melanoma were identified. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were based on the CoC definition for each measure. Patient-level and hospital-level adherence rates were calculated for the five measures. A hospital was deemed \"compliant\" if it met the CoC standard, which requires 80\u00a0% of patients to receive the measure-specific recommended care. Patient, tumor, and hospital characteristics potentially associated with higher likelihood of adherence at the patient-level were estimated using hierarchical random-effects logistic regression models.\nA total of 31,598 patients from 1343 hospitals were examined. Patient-level adherence rates varied from 31.6\u00a0% (Measure 5: \u226510 axillary lymph nodes removed\/examined) to 72.6\u00a0% (Measure 1: sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) appropriateness measure). Hospital-level adherence rates, ranged from 19.3\u00a0% of hospitals (N\u00a0=\u00a0538 hospitals for Measure 5) to 44.8\u00a0% of hospitals (N\u00a0=\u00a01090 hospitals for Measure 3: completion lymph node dissection after positive SLNB). No hospital-level factors (e.g., teaching status) were consistently associated with better adherence.\nNational adherence rates to the five new CoC melanoma quality metrics are low, and most hospitals would not meet the CoC requirement of 80\u00a0% adherence. Feedback for performance of these measures to hospitals, decisions support tools, and educational initiatives are needed to improve guideline adherence.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a31","authors":["Christina A.
