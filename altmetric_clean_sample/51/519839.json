We used two-hybrid screens to identify a protein, tumorous imaginal discs (Tid1), that binds to the cytoplasmic domain of muscle-specific kinase (MuSK), a major component of the agrin receptor. Like MuSK, Tid1 colocalizes with AChRs at developing, adult, and denervated motor endplates. Knockdown of Tid1 by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in skeletal muscle fibers dispersed synaptic AChR clusters and impaired neuromuscular transmission. In cultured myotubes, Tid1 knockdown inhibited AChR clustering, as well as agrin-induced activation of the Rac and Rho small GTPases and tyrosine phosphorylation of the AChR, without affecting MuSK activation. Tid1 knockdown also decreased Dok-7-induced clustering of AChRs. Overexpression of the N-terminal half of Tid1 induced agrin- and MuSK-independent phosphorylation and clustering of AChRs. These results demonstrate that Tid1 is an essential component of the agrin signaling pathway, crucial for synaptic development.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f61000319c","authors":["Linnoila J","Wang Y","Yao Y","Wang ZZ"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neuron.2008.09.025","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T03:25:01+00:00","issns":["0896-6273"],"issue":"4","journal":"Neuron","last_mentioned_on":1228867200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19038220","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.neuron.2008.09.025"],"pmcid":"PMC3225410","pmid":"19038220","pubdate":"2008-11-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"A Mammalian Homolog of Drosophila Tumorous Imaginal Discs, Tid1, Mediates Agrin Signaling at the Neuromuscular Junction","type":"article","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mammalian-homolog-drosophila-tumorous-imaginal-discs-tid1-mediates-agrin-signaling-neuromuscular-jun"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4012938,"mean":5.0323237266256,"rank":2247966,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1030262,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4012938,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233274,"mean":3.987266195686,"rank":101632,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":90868,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233274,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3976,"mean":10.714220432813,"rank":2526,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":679,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3976,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":344,"mean":12.034110787172,"rank":268,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":55,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":344,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
