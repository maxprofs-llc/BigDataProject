We generated knock-in alleles of murine Lgr6, a close relative of the Lgr5 stem cell gene. Lgr6 was expressed in the earliest embryonic hair placodes. In adult hair follicles, Lgr6+ cells resided in a previously uncharacterized region directly above the follicle bulge. They expressed none of the known bulge stem cell markers. Prenatal Lgr6+ cells established the hair follicle, sebaceous gland, and interfollicular epidermis. Postnatally, Lgr6+ cells generated sebaceous gland and interfollicular epidermis, whereas contribution to hair lineages gradually diminished with age. Adult Lgr6+ cells executed long-term wound repair, including the formation of new hair follicles. We conclude that Lgr6 marks the most primitive epidermal stem cell.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2010Sci...327.1385S","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","doi":"10.1126\/science.1184733","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T00:50:03+00:00","issns":["1095-9203"],"issue":"5971","journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":1270512000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20223988"],"pmid":"20223988","pubdate":"2010-03-12T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Lgr6 marks stem cells in the hair follicle that generate all cell lineages of the skin.","type":"article","volume":"327","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lgr6-marks-stem-cells-hair-follicle-generate-cell-lineages-skin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627464,"mean":4.9483847763613,"rank":2018316,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":932601,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627464,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231887,"mean":3.9439725899798,"rank":100496,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":89817,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231887,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27851,"mean":21.062106427289,"rank":22395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":3129,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27851,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":992,"mean":20.236302724521,"rank":614,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":337,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":992,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":33,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":104,"Student  > Doctoral Student":11,"Student  > Ph.
