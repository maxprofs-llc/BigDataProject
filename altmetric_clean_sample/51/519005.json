The current authors examined the effect of macrolide therapy on 30- and 90-day mortality for patients with severe sepsis caused by pneumonia. A retrospective cohort study was conducted at two tertiary teaching hospitals. Eligible subjects were admitted with a diagnosis of, had chest radiography consistent with, and had a discharge diagnosis of pneumonia and clinical criteria of severe sepsis. Subjects were considered to be on macrolides if they received at least one dose within 48 h of admission. Severe sepsis was present in 237 (30.1%) subjects, out of whom 104 (43.9%) received macrolides. Mortality was 20.3% at 30 days and 24.5% at 90 days. In the multivariable analysis, the use of macrolide was associated with decreased mortality at 30 days (hazard ratio (HR) 0.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2-0.7) and at 90 days (HR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.6) in patients with severe sepsis and in patients with macrolide-resistant pathogens (HR 0.1, 95% CI 0.02-0.5). Macrolide use was associated with decreased mortality in patients with severe sepsis due to pneumonia and macrolide-resistant pathogens. Confirmatory studies are needed to determine whether macrolide therapy may be protective for patients with sepsis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f610007384","authors":["Restrepo MI","Mortensen EM","Waterer GW","Wunderink RG","Coalson JJ","Anzueto A"],"doi":"10.1183\/09031936.00054108","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T02:51:09+00:00","issns":["0903-1936","1399-3003"],"issue":"1","journal":"European Respiratory Journal","last_mentioned_on":1401825540,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18768577","http:\/\/m.erj.ersjournals.com\/content\/33\/1\/153.full.pdf"],"pmid":"18768577","pubdate":"2008-09-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Impact of macrolide therapy on mortality for patients with severe sepsis due to pneumonia","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-macrolide-therapy-mortality-patients-severe-sepsis-due-pneumonia-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.386,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.386},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7385077,"mean":6.416372634753,"rank":867303,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":6518001,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7385077,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246479,"mean":4.8204025835979,"rank":27961,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":218514,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246479,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3250,"mean":5.8700437057556,"rank":494,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":2757,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3250,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262,"mean":3.3674022988506,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":2,"Lecturer":3,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":11,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"JP":1},"mendeley":{"BR":1,"RU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/kadsho\/status\/229261200368754688","citation_ids":[519005],"posted_on":"2012-07-28T17:05:04+00:00","author":{"name":"\u9580\u6751\u5c06\u592a Hosp Pharmacist","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/778806726757748737\/QcGpyRcy_normal.jpg","description":"PIC(JSHP)\/IDCP(JSC)\/CNP(JSNP)\/\u85ac\u7269\u7642\u6cd5\u5c02\u9580\u85ac\u5264\u5e2b(JSPHCS) #PharmaceuticalCare, #ClinicalPharmacy, #DI, #Pharmacoepidemiology, #EBM, #AntimicrobialStewardship #ASP","id_on_source":"kadsho","tweeter_id":"168488514","geo":{"lt":43.06417,"ln":141.34694,"country":"JP"},"followers":2133},"tweet_id":"229261200368754688"}],"f1000":[{"title":"Recommended in F1000 Prime","url":"https:\/\/f1000.com\/prime\/1147079","license":"public","citation_ids":[519005],"posted_on":"2009-02-20T00:00:00+00:00","f1000_classes":["confirmation"],"f1000_score":"4"},{"title":"Recommended in F1000 Prime","url":"https:\/\/f1000.com\/prime\/1147079#1","license":"public","citation_ids":[519005],"posted_on":"2009-05-11T00:00:00+00:00","f1000_classes":["confirmation"],"f1000_score":"4"},{"title":"Recommended in F1000 Prime","url":"https:\/\/f1000.com\/prime\/1147079#2","license":"public","citation_ids":[519005],"posted_on":"2009-01-26T00:00:00+00:00","f1000_classes":["confirmation"],"f1000_score":"4"}],"blogs":[{"title":"Association of Azithromycin With Mortality and Cardiovascular Events Among Older Patients Hospitalized With Pneumoniaew","url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1001\/jama.2014.4304","license":"public","citation_ids":[6715794,390412,390412,17311436,17311438,17311439,17311441,17311443,17311444,17311447,17311447,699404,699404,17311455,17311460,17311460,747360,747360,1426500,1426500,5573535,5573535,1240998,1240998,1324356,16703265,17311466,17311466,16154984,16154984,3211465,3211465,17311471,17311473,17311474,17311475,8164741,8164741,14784101,8802663,8802663,2303240,2303240,527134,527134,17311480,17311481,5155518,17311483,17311484,17311490,17311490,17311492,17311492,17311495,17311495,255945,255945,17311497,17311498,17311498,1953388,17311501,17311502,3244518,17311503,17311504,2547080,2547079,2547079,519005,519005,17311507,17311507,17311508,17311508,776926,776926,231457,231457,17311513,12208416],"posted_on":"2014-06-03T19:59:00+00:00","summary":"Interview with Eric M.
