Initial research indicated that damage to this structure produced amnesia for newly acquired memories but did not affect those formed in the distant past. A number of recent studies, however, have found that the hippocampus is required for the retrieval of episodic and contextual memories regardless of their age. These findings are currently the subject of intense debate, and a satisfying resolution has yet to be identified.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002660","doi":"10.1016\/j.cub.2010.06.068","first_seen_on":"2011-12-30T21:57:36+00:00","issns":["1879-0445"],"issue":"15","journal":"Current Biology","last_mentioned_on":1294790400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20637623"],"pmid":"20637623","pubdate":"2010-08-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"The hippocampus plays a selective role in the retrieval of detailed contextual memories.","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hippocampus-plays-selective-role-retrieval-detailed-contextual-memories"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635050,"mean":4.9227315329755,"rank":2018188,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":945431,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635050,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232189,"mean":3.8901724206249,"rank":99688,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":91640,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232189,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4858,"mean":15.646659666461,"rank":3331,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":744,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4858,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243,"mean":15.075760330579,"rank":165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":16,"Researcher":50,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
