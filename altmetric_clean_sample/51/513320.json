Roles in the regulation of their complementary mRNAs are often imputed to these antisense transcripts, but few have been experimentally examined, and such functions remain largely conjectural. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) encodes two transcripts that lack obvious ORFs and are complementary to the gene (RTA) encoding the master regulator of the latent\/lytic switch. Here, we show that, contrary to expectation, these RNAs do not regulate RTA expression. Rather, they are found on polysomes, and genetic analysis indicates that translational initiation occurs at several AUG codons in the RNA, leading to the presumptive synthesis of peptides of 17 to 48 amino acids. These findings underscore the need for circumspection in the computational assessment of coding potential and raise the possibility that the mammalian proteome may contain many previously unsuspected peptides generated from seemingly noncoding RNAs, some of which could have important biological functions. Irrespective of their function, such peptides could also contribute substantially to the repertoire of T cell epitopes generated in both uninfected and infected cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f92","doi":"10.1128\/jvi.02705-09","first_seen_on":"2011-12-30T22:02:59+00:00","issns":["1098-5514"],"issue":"11","journal":"Journal of Virology","last_mentioned_on":1273795200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20357088"],"pmid":"20357088","pubdate":"2010-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society for Microbiology (ASM)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Making sense of antisense: seemingly noncoding RNAs antisense to the master regulator of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus lytic replication do not regulate that transcript but serve as mRNAs encoding small peptides.","type":"article","volume":"84","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/making-sense-antisense-seemingly-noncoding-rnas-antisense-master-regulator-kaposis-sarcomaassociated"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3616025,"mean":4.9319901986302,"rank":2015351,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":923966,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3616025,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231754,"mean":3.9502467368277,"rank":100703,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":89207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231754,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4373,"mean":3.0338591033852,"rank":2182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1271,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4373,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":332,"mean":1.3924954682779,"rank":96,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":182,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":332,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
