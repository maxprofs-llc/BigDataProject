From a C. elegans mutagenesis screen, we found that loss of ACS-3, a long-chain acyl-CoA synthase, causes enhanced intestinal lipid uptake, de novo fat synthesis, and accumulation of enlarged, neutral lipid-rich intestinal depots. Here, we show that ACS-3 functions in seam cells, epidermal cells anatomically distinct from sites of fat uptake and storage, and that acs-3 mutant phenotypes require the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-25, a key regulator of C. elegans molting. Our findings suggest that ACS-3-derived long-chain fatty\u00a0acyl-CoAs, perhaps incorporated into complex\u00a0ligands such as phosphoinositides, modulate NHR-25 function, which in turn regulates an endocrine program of lipid uptake and synthesis. These results reveal a link between acyl-CoA synthase function and an NR5A family nuclear receptor in C.\u00a0elegans.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067cf","doi":"10.1016\/j.cmet.2010.08.013","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T01:49:20+00:00","issns":["1932-7420"],"issue":"4","journal":"Cell Metabolism (Science Direct)","last_mentioned_on":1295308800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20889131"],"pmid":"20889131","pubdate":"2010-10-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","cellbiology"],"title":"Regulation of C. elegans fat uptake and storage by acyl-CoA synthase-3 is dependent on NR5A family nuclear hormone receptor nhr-25.","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/regulation-c-elegans-fat-uptake-storage-acylcoa-synthase3-dependent-nr5a-family-nuclear-hormone-rece"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626860,"mean":4.9517239589446,"rank":2018778,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":930925,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626860,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231868,"mean":3.9500170528796,"rank":100580,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":89615,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231868,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":896,"mean":13.445280446927,"rank":613,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":896,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93,"mean":6.7093913043478,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
