The precisely timed repression of the stem cell identity gene WUSCHEL (WUS) by the floral homeotic protein AGAMOUS (AG) is a key part of this process. In this study, we report on the identification of a novel input into the process of floral stem cell regulation. We use genetics and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to demonstrate that the bZIP transcription factor PERIANTHIA (PAN) plays a role in regulating stem cell fate by directly controlling AG expression and suggest that this activity is spatially restricted to the centermost region of the AG expression domain. These results suggest that the termination of floral stem cell fate is a multiply redundant process involving loci with unrelated floral patterning functions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026e9","doi":"10.1242\/dev.035436","first_seen_on":"2011-12-30T22:38:13+00:00","issns":["0950-1991"],"issue":"10","journal":"Development (09501991)","last_mentioned_on":1244764800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19395638"],"pmid":"19395638","pubdate":"2009-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences"],"subjects":["embryology","biology"],"title":"Floral stem cell termination involves the direct regulation of AGAMOUS by PERIANTHIA.","type":"article","volume":"136","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/floral-stem-cell-termination-involves-direct-regulation-agamous-perianthia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4510149,"mean":5.2636614770391,"rank":2312856,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1603859,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4510149,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235602,"mean":4.3072366331215,"rank":100500,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":103087,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235602,"percentile":43},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3165,"mean":4.6091232616941,"rank":1876,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":637,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3165,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275,"mean":6.1457883211679,"rank":214,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":11,"Researcher":19,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
