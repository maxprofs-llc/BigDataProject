However, the interface between primary metabolism and disease responses remains largely unclear. Here, we show that knockout of a single amino acid transporter, LYSINE HISTIDINE TRANSPORTER1 (LHT1), is sufficient for Arabidopsis thaliana plants to confer a broad spectrum of disease resistance in a salicylic acid-dependent manner. We found that redox fine-tuning in photosynthetic cells was causally linked to the lht1 mutant-associated phenotypes. Furthermore, the enhanced resistance in lht1 could be attributed to a specific deficiency of its main physiological substrate, Gln, and not to a general nitrogen deficiency. Thus, by enabling nitrogen metabolism to moderate the cellular redox status, a plant primary metabolite, Gln, plays a crucial role in plant disease resistance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003335","doi":"10.1105\/tpc.110.079392","first_seen_on":"2011-12-30T21:52:06+00:00","issns":["1532-298X"],"issue":"11","journal":"Plant Cell","last_mentioned_on":1300406400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21097712"],"pmid":"21097712","pubdate":"2010-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society of Plant Biologists","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","botany"],"title":"Amino acid homeostasis modulates salicylic acid-associated redox status and defense responses in Arabidopsis.","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/amino-acid-homeostasis-modulates-salicylic-acidassociated-redox-status-defense-responses-arabidopsis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631524,"mean":4.926174121992,"rank":2015253,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":944319,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631524,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232174,"mean":3.9028713416292,"rank":99922,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":91175,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232174,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1916,"mean":2.5681608355091,"rank":903,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":377,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1916,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164,"mean":2.608736196319,"rank":94,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":30,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
