It has also been evaluated in several clinical trials for treatment of brain tumors such as high-grade glioma. In this study, we investigated the influence of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) on distribution of gefitinib to the central nervous system. In vitro studies conducted in Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells indicate that both P-gp and BCRP effectively transport gefitinib, limiting its intracellular accumulation. In vivo studies demonstrated that transport of gefitinib across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is significantly limited. Steady-state brain-to-plasma (B\/P) concentration ratios were 70-fold higher in the Mdr1a\/b(-\/-) Bcrp1(-\/-) mice (ratio of approximately 7) compared with wild-type mice (ratio of approximately 0.1). The B\/P ratio after oral administration increased significantly when gefitinib was coadministered with the dual P-gp and BCRP inhibitor elacridar. We investigated the integrity of tight junctions in the Mdr1a\/b(-\/-) Bcrp1(-\/-) mice and found no difference in the brain inulin and sucrose space between the wild-type and Mdr1a\/b(-\/-) Bcrp1(-\/-) mice. This suggested that the dramatic enhancement in the brain distribution of gefitinib is not due to a leakier BBB in these mice. These results show that brain distribution of gefitinib is restricted due to active efflux by P-gp and BCRP. This finding is of clinical significance for therapy in brain tumors such as glioma, where concurrent administration of a dual inhibitor such as elacridar can increase delivery and thus enhance efficacy of gefitinib.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007de2","authors":["Agarwal S","Sane R","Gallardo JL","Ohlfest JR","Elmquist WF"],"doi":"10.1124\/jpet.110.167601","endpage":"155","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T03:10:44+00:00","issns":["0022-3565","1521-0103 (Online)","1521-0103"],"issue":"1","journal":"The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1273449600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20421331","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1124\/jpet.110.167601"],"pmcid":"PMC2912048","pmid":"20421331","pubdate":"2010-04-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"147","subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Distribution of Gefitinib to the Brain Is Limited by P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (ABCG2)-Mediated Active Efflux","type":"article","volume":"334","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/distribution-gefitinib-brain-limited-pglycoprotein-abcb1-breast-cancer-resistance-protein-abcg2media"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628014,"mean":4.9445414826282,"rank":2017789,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":934397,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628014,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231888,"mean":3.9389815815464,"rank":100397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":89981,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231888,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1522,"mean":2.8407403024326,"rank":973,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":336,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1522,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":2.1343076923077,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
