The enzyme phycoerythrobilin synthase (PebS), recently discovered in a marine virus infecting oceanic cyanobacteria of the genus Prochlorococcus (cyanophage PSSM-2), is a new member of the ferredoxin-dependent bilin reductase (FDBR) family. In a formal four-electron reduction, the substrate biliverdin IXalpha is reduced to yield 3Z-PEB, a reaction that commonly requires the action of two individual FDBRs. The first reaction catalyzed by PebS is the reduction of the 15,16-methine bridge of the biliverdin IXalpha tetrapyrrole system. This reaction is exclusive to PEB biosynthetic enzymes. The second reduction site is the A-ring 2,3,3(1),3(2)-diene system, the most common target of FDBRs. Here, we present the first crystal structures of a PEB biosynthetic enzyme. Structures of the substrate complex were solved at 1.8- and 2.1-A resolution and of the substrate-free form at 1.55-A resolution. The overall folding revealed an alpha\/beta\/alpha-sandwich with similarity to the structure of phycocyanobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PcyA). The substrate-binding site is located between the central beta-sheet and C-terminal alpha-helices. Eight refined molecules with bound substrate, from two different crystal forms, revealed a high flexibility of the substrate-binding pocket. The substrate was found to be either in a planar porphyrin-like conformation or in a helical conformation and is coordinated by a conserved aspartate\/asparagine pair from the beta-sheet side. From the alpha-helix side, a conserved highly flexible aspartate\/proline pair is involved in substrate binding and presumably catalysis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Dammeyer T","Hofmann E","Frankenberg-Dinkel N"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m803765200","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T03:25:55+00:00","issns":["0021-9258","1083-351X"],"issue":"41","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1224460800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18662988","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1074\/jbc.M803765200"],"pmid":"18662988","pubdate":"2008-07-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Phycoerythrobilin Synthase (PebS) of a Marine Virus CRYSTAL STRUCTURES OF THE BILIVERDIN COMPLEX AND THE SUBSTRATE-FREE FORM","type":"article","volume":"283","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phycoerythrobilin-synthase-pebs-marine-virus-crystal-structuresofthe-biliverdin-complexandthe-substr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629591,"mean":4.9337473984712,"rank":2016055,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":939923,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629591,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231899,"mean":3.9213580539723,"rank":100109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":90559,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231899,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28042,"mean":2.6410416889555,"rank":19779,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":4071,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28042,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1193,"mean":1.5535134228188,"rank":380,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":450,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1193,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
