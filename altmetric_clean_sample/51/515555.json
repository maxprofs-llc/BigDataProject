To gain insight into their mechanism of action, the crystal structure of the canonical oxazolidinone, linezolid, has been determined bound to the Haloarcula marismortui 50S subunit. Linezolid binds the 50S A-site, near the catalytic center, which suggests that inhibition involves competition with incoming A-site substrates. These results provide a structural basis for the discovery of improved oxazolidinones active against emerging drug-resistant clinical strains.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e47","doi":"10.1021\/jm800379d","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T00:03:38+00:00","issns":["0022-2623"],"issue":"12","journal":"Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1242660005,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18494460"],"pmid":"18494460","pubdate":"2008-06-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Crystal structure of the oxazolidinone antibiotic linezolid bound to the 50S ribosomal subunit.","type":"article","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/crystal-structure-oxazolidinone-antibiotic-linezolid-bound-50s-ribosomal-subunit"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627387,"mean":4.9489064262842,"rank":681698,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":2921878,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627387,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231886,"mean":3.9447128188544,"rank":39305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":191708,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231886,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2707,"mean":3.4206090169993,"rank":459,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":2226,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2707,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":3.2765423728814,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
