Many cancers are estrogen-sensitive with neoplastic growth stimulated through the estrogen receptor, a transcription factor that regulates developmental genes. We demonstrate that the human ESR1 gene is rich in potential quadruplex-forming sequences with 3 of 20 identified within exonic regions. In particular, we show using CD, UV, and NMR spectroscopy that a stable DNA G-quadruplex motif is formed within the exon C gene sequence. This motif, which PCR shows is transcribed in normal and neoplastic endometrium and in MCF-7 cells, forms a stable RNA quadruplex demonstrable by CD and UV analysis. Cloning the exon C G-quadruplex sequence upstream of a luciferase reporter gene caused a 6-fold reduction of enzymatic activity compared to a mutant sequence. We conclude that the exon C G-quadruplex motif is present in the 5'-UTR of the mRNA transcript, where it modulates the efficiency of translation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c7","doi":"10.1021\/bi901420k","first_seen_on":"2011-12-30T22:54:24+00:00","issns":["1520-4995"],"issue":"48","journal":"Biochemistry (00062979)","last_mentioned_on":1257984000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19860473"],"pmid":"19860473","pubdate":"2009-12-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Repression of translation of human estrogen receptor alpha by G-quadruplex formation.","type":"article","volume":"48","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/repression-translation-human-estrogen-receptor-gquadruplex-formation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628216,"mean":4.9435109727551,"rank":2017552,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":935145,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628216,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232152,"mean":3.9304267997986,"rank":100378,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":90267,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232152,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5464,"mean":2.4678605161999,"rank":3933,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":896,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5464,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":0.94673913043478,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
