Mixtures of these 4f and 5f elements also revealed the formation of a rare case of lanthanide-uranyl coordination polymers. Their structures, determined by XRD single-crystal analysis, exhibit three distinct architectures. The pure lanthanide mellitate Ln(2)(H(2)O)(6)(mel) possesses a 3D framework built up from the connection of isolated LnO(6)(H(2)O)(3) polyhedra (tricapped trigonal prism) through the mellitate ligand. The structure of the uranyl mellitate (UO(2))(3)(H(2)O)(6)(mel)\u00b711.5H(2)O is lamellar and consists of 8-fold coordinated uranium atoms linked to each other through the organic ligand giving rise to the formation of a 2D 3(6) net. The third structural type, (UO(2))(2)Ln(OH)(H(2)O)(3)(mel)\u00b72.5H(2)O, involves direct oxygen bondings between the lanthanide and uranyl centers, with the isolation of a heterometallic dinuclear motif. The 9-fold coordinated Ln cation, LnO(5)(OH)(H(2)O)(3), is linked to the 7-fold coordinated uranyl (UO(2))O(4)(OH) (pentagonal bipyramid) via one \u03bc(2)-hydroxo group and one \u03bc(2)-oxo group. The latter is shared between the uranyl bonding (U\u2550O = 1.777(4)\/1.779(6) \u00c5) and a long Ln-O bonding (Ce-O = 2.822(4) \u00c5; Nd-O = 2.792(6) \u00c5). This unusual linkage is a unique illustration of the so-called cation-cation interaction associating 4f and 5f metals. The dinuclear motif is then further connected through the mellitate ligand, and this generates organic-inorganic layers that are linked to each other via discrete uranyl (UO(2))O(4) units (square bipyramid), which ensure the three-dimensional cohesion of the structure. The mixed U-Ln carboxylate is thermally decomposed from 260 to 280 \u00b0C and then transformed into the basic uranium oxide (U(3)O(8)) together with U-Ln oxide with the fluorite structural type (\"(Ln,U)O(2)\"). At 1400 \u00b0C, only fluorite type \"(Ln,U)O(2)\" is formed with the measured stoichiometry of U(0.63)Ce(0.37)O(2) and U(0.60)Nd(0.40)O(2-\u03b4).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Christophe Volkringer","Natacha Henry","St\u00e9phane Grandjean","Thierry Loiseau"],"doi":"10.1021\/ja209915n","first_seen_on":"2011-12-29T22:49:21+00:00","issns":["0002-7863","1520-5126"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1325198224,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ja209915n"],"pmid":"22206304","pubdate":"2011-12-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"111229111903009","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"\n              Uranyl and\/or Rare-Earth Mellitates in Extended Organic\u2013Inorganic Networks: A Unique Case of Heterometallic Cation\u2013Cation Interaction with U\n              \n              \u2550O\u2013Ln\n              \n              Bonding (Ln = Ce, Nd)\n            ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/uranyl-andor-rareearth-mellitates-extended-organicinorganic-networks-unique-case-heterometallic-cati"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506977,"mean":5.1265981649798,"rank":3538208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":135768,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506977,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235619,"mean":4.2136884957858,"rank":184710,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1153,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235619,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15478,"mean":4.1168665762099,"rank":12695,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":1166,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15478,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":424,"mean":4.5632624113475,"rank":357,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":424,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
