Preconditioning can also be achieved by exposure of neurons to K+ channel-opening drugs that act on adenosine triphosphate-sensitive K+ (K(ATP)) channels. However, these agents do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier. Inhalational anesthetics which easily partition into brain have been shown to precondition various tissues. Here, the authors explore the neuronal preconditioning effect of modern inhalational anesthetics and investigate their effects on K(ATP) channels.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002255","doi":"10.1097\/aln.0b013e31819dadc7","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T01:10:08+00:00","issns":["1528-1175"],"issue":"5","journal":"Anesthesiology","last_mentioned_on":1345424871,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19352153","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2930813"],"pmid":"19352153","pubdate":"2009-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society of Anesthesiologists, Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["anesthesiology"],"title":"Neuronal Preconditioning by Inhalational Anesthetics: Evidence for the Role of Plasmalemmal Adenosine Triphosphate\u2013sensitive Potassium Channels","type":"article","volume":"110","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neuronal-preconditioning-inhalational-anesthetics"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631265,"mean":4.9266893682253,"rank":680440,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":2927165,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631265,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231907,"mean":3.9098909385702,"rank":39110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":191928,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231907,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2173,"mean":2.9138489871087,"rank":279,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":1873,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2173,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":2.2171777777778,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":78,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
