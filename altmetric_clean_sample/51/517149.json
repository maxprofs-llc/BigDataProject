This study found that levels of vesicles and intravascular haemolysis were linked as shown by the correlation between levels of vesicles and plasma Hb. Vesicle levels were 6-fold greater in SCA and 4-fold greater in TI than in controls. The proportion of plasma Hb within vesicles was increased in SCA and TI with a significantly higher proportion in TI. We examined whether subpopulations of RBC expressing phosphatidylserine (PS) were a source of PS(+) vesicles and observed a significant association. Thrombin generation was promoted by the vesicles in which 40-50% expressed PS. In TI, markers of thrombin generation were significantly related to PS(+) RBC. Splenectomy in TI had significant effects including greater increases in vesicle levels, plasma Hb, PS(+) RBCs and thrombin generation markers than in unsplenectomised patients. In hydroxycarbamide (HC)-treated SCA patients these measures were decreased compared with untreated controls. The relationship between vesicle levels and plasma Hb suggests a mechanism linking vesiculation to haemolysis and consequently nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and suggests a means by which HC treatment improves NO bioavailability.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002446","authors":["Westerman, Maxwell","Pizzey, Arnold","Hirschman, Jocelyn","Cerino, Mario","Weil\u2010Weiner, Yonit","Ramotar, Prya","Eze, Ada","Lawrie, Andrew","Purdy, Gordon","Mackie, Ian","Porter, John"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1365-2141.2008.07155.x","endpage":"135","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T01:25:18+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1365-2141","0007-1048"],"issue":"1","journal":"British Journal of Haematology","last_mentioned_on":1414146527,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18422994","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1365-2141.2008.07155.x\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1365-2141.2008.07155.x\/pdf","pmid":"18422994","pubdate":"2008-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BLACKWELL PUBLISHING","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"126","subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Microvesicles in haemoglobinopathies offer insights into mechanisms of hypercoagulability, haemolysis and the effects of therapy.","type":"article","volume":"142","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microvesicles-haemoglobinopathies-offer-insights-mechanisms-hypercoagulability-haemolysis-effects-th"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5207789,"mean":6.1666696716555,"rank":1198822,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":3987413,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5207789,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238539,"mean":4.5147695629209,"rank":48753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":188360,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238539,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1550,"mean":2.1976126533247,"rank":138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":1411,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1550,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":1.3270379746835,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":76,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
