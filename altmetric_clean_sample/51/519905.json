We demonstrated that after oral infection, the parasite rapidly recruited inflammatory monocytes [Gr1(+) (Ly6C(+), Ly6G(-)) F4\/80(+)CD11b(+)CD11c(-)], which established a vital defensive perimeter within the villi of the ileum in the small intestine. Mice deficient of the chemokine receptor CCR2 or the ligand CCL2 failed to recruit Gr1(+) inflammatory monocytes, whereas dendritic cells and resident tissue macrophages remained unaltered. The selective lack of Gr1(+) inflammatory monocytes resulted in an inability of mice to control replication of the parasite, high influx of neutrophils, extensive intestinal necrosis, and rapid death. Adoptive transfer of sorted Gr1(+) inflammatory monocytes demonstrated their ability to home to the ileum in infected animals and protect Ccr2(-\/-) mice, which were otherwise highly susceptible to oral toxoplasmosis. Collectively, these findings illustrate the critical importance of inflammatory monocytes as a first line of defense in controlling intestinal pathogens.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a95","authors":["Dunay IR","Damatta RA","Fux B","Presti R","Greco S","Colonna M","Sibley LD"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.immuni.2008.05.019","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T03:27:10+00:00","issns":["1074-7613"],"issue":"2","journal":"Immunity","last_mentioned_on":1219276800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18691912","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.immuni.2008.05.019"],"pmid":"18691912","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Gr1+ Inflammatory Monocytes Are Required for Mucosal Resistance to the Pathogen Toxoplasma gondii","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gr1-inflammatory-monocytes-required-mucosal-resistance-pathogen-toxoplasma-gondii"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3620975,"mean":4.9297103293237,"rank":2016160,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":927539,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3620975,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231765,"mean":3.9486933345991,"rank":100617,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":89394,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231765,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1763,"mean":4.3388308740068,"rank":942,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":361,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1763,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":1.570253164557,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Researcher":37,"Student  > Doctoral Student":12,"Student  > Ph.
