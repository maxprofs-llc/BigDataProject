Although reduction in CENP-E leads to high rates of whole chromosome missegregation, neither its properties as a microtubule-dependent motor nor how it contributes to the dynamic linkage between kinetochores and microtubules is known. Using single-molecule assays, we demonstrate that CENP-E is a very slow, highly processive motor that maintains microtubule attachment for long periods. Direct visualization of full-length Xenopus laevis CENP-E reveals a highly flexible 230-nm coiled coil separating its kinetochore-binding and motor domains. We also show that full-length CENP-E is a slow plus end-directed motor whose activity is essential for metaphase chromosome alignment. We propose that the highly processive microtubule-dependent motor activity of CENP-E serves to power chromosome congression and provides a flexible, motile tether linking kinetochores to dynamic spindle microtubules.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002ce3","doi":"10.1083\/jcb.200802189","first_seen_on":"2011-12-30T23:42:51+00:00","issns":["1540-8140"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1209686400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18443223"],"pmid":"18443223","pubdate":"2008-05-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Rockefeller University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"CENP-E combines a slow, processive motor and a flexible coiled coil to produce an essential motile kinetochore tether.","type":"article","volume":"181","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cenpe-combines-slow-processive-motor-flexible-coiled-coil-produce-essential-motile-kinetochore-tethe"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3620974,"mean":4.9299989306774,"rank":2016265,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":927365,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3620974,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232027,"mean":3.9425834690941,"rank":100655,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":89561,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232027,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4070,"mean":3.2621051855493,"rank":2395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":474,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4070,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":255,"mean":2.9868818897638,"rank":150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":73,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":255,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":25,"Student  > Ph.
