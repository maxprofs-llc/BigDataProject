Figure 4 de ce PDF"],"citation":{"abstract":"CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) natural regulatory T cells (T reg cells) maintain self-tolerance and suppress autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In addition to their effects on T cells, T reg cells are essential for maintaining normal numbers of dendritic cells (DCs): when T reg cells are depleted, there is a compensatory Flt3-dependent increase in DCs. However, little is known about how T reg cell homeostasis is maintained in vivo. We demonstrate the existence of a feedback regulatory loop between DCs and T reg cells. We find that loss of DCs leads to a loss of T reg cells, and that the remaining T reg cells exhibit decreased Foxp3 expression. The DC-dependent loss in T reg cells leads to an increase in the number of T cells producing inflammatory cytokines, such as interferon gamma and interleukin 17. Conversely, increasing the number of DCs leads to increased T reg cell division and accumulation by a mechanism that requires major histocompatibility complex II expression on DCs. The increase in T reg cells induced by DC expansion is sufficient to prevent type 1 autoimmune diabetes and IBD, which suggests that interference with this feedback loop will create new opportunities for immune-based therapies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c77","authors":["Darrasse-J\u00e8ze G","Deroubaix S","Mouquet H","Victora GD","Eisenreich T","Yao KH","Masilamani RF","Dustin ML","Rudensky A","Liu K","Nussenzweig MC"],"doi":"10.1084\/jem.20090746","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T02:03:57+00:00","issns":["1540-9538"],"issue":"9","journal":"The Journal of Experimental Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1412673910,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19667061","http:\/\/m.jem.rupress.org\/content\/206\/9\/1853.full.pdf","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1084\/jem.20090746"],"pmid":"19667061","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Rockefeller University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["medicine","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Feedback control of regulatory T cell homeostasis by dendritic cells in vivo","type":"article","volume":"206","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/feedback-control-regulatory-t-cell-homeostasis-dendritic-cells-vivo-12"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4340057,"mean":4.91896056455,"rank":1782450,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2445953,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4340057,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234386,"mean":3.9837462550933,"rank":66392,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":162788,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234386,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2951,"mean":3.7298284745763,"rank":1282,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":1612,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2951,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":153,"mean":3.5601052631579,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":76,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":153,"percentile":49}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
