Group I comprised 68 patients who underwent planned surgery between January 2002 and January 2003. Group II comprised a sample of 202 patients who underwent surgery between January 2004 and December 2008. No significant differences were found in the majority of the parameters measured: postoperative stay, compliance with antibiotic prophylaxis, compliance with the staging study, mortality, rate of infection, and reoperations. The mean length of stay (\u00b1standard deviation) for patients without complications was reduced significantly (9.2 \u00b1 3.6 in group I versus 7.7 \u00b1 1.7 in group II, P = .031). The CP for CRC did not achieve most of the objectives for which it was designed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f61000570c","authors":["Soria-Aledo V","Mengual-Ballester M","Pellicer-Franco E","Carrillo-Alcaraz A","Cases-Bald\u00f3 MJ","Carrasco-Prats M","Campillo-Soto A","Flores-Pastor B","Aguayo-Albasini JL"],"doi":"10.1177\/1062860611404049","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T02:49:28+00:00","issns":["1062-8606"],"issue":"5","journal":"American Journal of Medical Quality","last_mentioned_on":1324644805,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21825037"],"pmid":"21825037","pubdate":"2011-08-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["healthservices"],"title":"Evaluation of a clinical pathway to improve colorectal cancer outcomes.","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-clinical-pathway-improve-colorectal-cancer-outcomes-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506214,"mean":5.1186469373082,"rank":3109607,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":998952,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506214,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235115,"mean":4.1902592104258,"rank":147814,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":57940,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235115,"percentile":24},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":305,"mean":4.0188618421053,"rank":225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":55,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":305,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":2.2524150943396,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":4,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/BVMurciasalud\/status\/150197314894577664","citation_ids":[518949],"posted_on":"2011-12-23T12:53:25+00:00","author":{"name":"BVirtual Murciasalud","url":"http:\/\/www.murciasalud.es\/bvms","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/489295536244015104\/WBHTnVIf_normal.png","description":"La Biblioteca de la Consejer\u00eda de Sanidad y el SMS para los profesionales sanitarios de la Regi\u00f3n de Murcia.
