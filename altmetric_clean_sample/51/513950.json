Cyclin A, the first cyclin ever cloned, is thought to be an essential component of the cell-cycle engine. Mammalian cells encode two A-type cyclins, testis-specific cyclin A1 and ubiquitously expressed cyclin A2. Here, we tested the requirement for cyclin A function using conditional knockout mice lacking both A-type cyclins. We found that acute ablation of cyclin A in fibroblasts did not affect cell proliferation, but led to prolonged expression of another cyclin, cyclin E, across the cell cycle. However, combined ablation of all A- and E-type cyclins extinguished cell division. In contrast, cyclin A function was essential for cell-cycle progression of hematopoietic and embryonic stem cells. Expression of cyclin A is particularly high in these compartments, which might render stem cells dependent on cyclin A, whereas in fibroblasts cyclins A and E play redundant roles in cell proliferation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c1","authors":["Kalaszczynska I","Geng Y","Iino T","Mizuno S","Choi Y","Kondratiuk I","Silver DP","Wolgemuth DJ","Akashi K","Sicinski P"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cell.2009.04.062","endpage":"365","first_seen_on":"2011-12-30T22:27:09+00:00","issns":["1097-4172","00928674"],"issue":"2","journal":"Cell","last_mentioned_on":1249257600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19592082"],"pmid":"19592082","pubdate":"2009-07-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"352","subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Cyclin A is redundant in fibroblasts but essential in hematopoietic and embryonic stem cells.","type":"article","volume":"138","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cyclin-redundant-fibroblasts-essential-hematopoietic-embryonic-stem-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634361,"mean":4.9198212791297,"rank":2015890,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":947305,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634361,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232186,"mean":3.8927824536472,"rank":99702,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":91578,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232186,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7728,"mean":10.610962339847,"rank":5688,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":972,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7728,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":461,"mean":12.9678,"rank":370,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":71,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":461,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":38,"Student  > Ph.
