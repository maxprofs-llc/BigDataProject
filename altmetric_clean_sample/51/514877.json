Here, we report the identification of FOXG1-truncating mutations in two patients affected by the congenital variant of Rett syndrome. FOXG1 encodes a brain-specific transcriptional repressor that is essential for early development of the telencephalon. Molecular analysis revealed that Foxg1 might also share common molecular mechanisms with MeCP2 during neuronal development, exhibiting partially overlapping expression domain in postnatal cortex and neuronal subnuclear localization.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021ff","authors":["Ariani F","Hayek G","Rondinella D","Artuso R","Mencarelli MA","Spanhol-Rosseto A","Pollazzon M","Buoni S","Spiga O","Ricciardi S","Meloni I","Longo I","Mari F","Broccoli V","Zappella M","Renieri A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ajhg.2008.05.015","first_seen_on":"2011-12-30T23:33:02+00:00","issns":["1537-6605"],"issue":"1","journal":"American Journal of Human Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1223078400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18571142","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2443837"],"pmcid":"PMC2443837","pmid":"18571142","pubdate":"2008-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"FOXG1 is responsible for the congenital variant of Rett syndrome.","type":"article","volume":"83","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/foxg1-responsible-congenital-variant-rett-syndrome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4366944,"mean":4.8710648140238,"rank":2363835,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1275390,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4366944,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234928,"mean":3.9662422454637,"rank":102495,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":91975,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234928,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3147,"mean":6.4354437380801,"rank":2434,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":519,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3147,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":9.0414864864865,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":32,"Student  > Ph.
