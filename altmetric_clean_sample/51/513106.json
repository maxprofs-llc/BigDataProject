Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy on dissolved crystals showed that it is present in the Ni-A state (>90%). The structure of the A. vinosum [NiFe] hydrogenase shows significant similarities with [NiFe] hydrogenase structures derived from Desulfovibrio species. The amino acid sequence identity is \u223c 50%. The bimetallic [NiFe] active site is located in the large subunit of the heterodimer and possesses three diatomic non-protein ligands coordinated to the Fe (two CN(-) , one CO). Ni is bound to the protein backbone via four cysteine thiolates; two of them also bridge the two metals. One of the bridging cysteines (Cys64) exhibits a modified thiolate in part of the sample. A mono-oxo bridging ligand was assigned between the metal ions of the catalytic center. This is in contrast to a proposal for Desulfovibrio sp. hydrogenases that show a di-oxo species in this position for the Ni-A state. The additional metal site located in the large subunit appears to be a Mg(2+) ion. Three iron-sulfur clusters were found in the small subunit that forms the electron transfer chain connecting the catalytic site with the molecular surface. The calculated anomalous Fourier map indicates a distorted proximal iron-sulfur cluster in part of the crystals. This altered proximal cluster is supposed to be paramagnetic and is exchange coupled to the Ni(3+) ion and the medial [Fe(3)S(4)](+) cluster that are both EPR active (S=1\/2 species). This finding of a modified proximal cluster in the [NiFe] hydrogenase might explain the observation of split EPR signals that are occasionally detected in the oxidized state of membrane-bound [NiFe] hydrogenases as from A. vinosum.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e5c","authors":["Ogata, Hideaki","Kellers, Petra","Lubitz, Wolfgang"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jmb.2010.07.041","first_seen_on":"2011-12-30T21:54:46+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1089-8638"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1281312000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20673834"],"pmid":"20673834","pubdate":"2010-09-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"The crystal structure of the [NiFe] hydrogenase from the photosynthetic bacterium Allochromatium vinosum: characterization of the oxidized enzyme (Ni-A state).","type":"article","volume":"402","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/crystal-structure-nife-hydrogenase-photosynthetic-bacterium-allochromatium-vinosum-characterization"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3636263,"mean":4.9213309833055,"rank":2018885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":945822,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3636263,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232193,"mean":3.8905302336,"rank":99677,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":91690,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232193,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3302,"mean":2.5184271432899,"rank":2226,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":592,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3302,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":0.95,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":19,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
