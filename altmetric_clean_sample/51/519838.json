We found that the induction of long-term facilitation (LTF) by repeated applications of serotonin, a modulatory transmitter released during learning in Aplysia, requires upregulation of kinesin heavy chain (KHC) in both pre- and postsynaptic neurons. Indeed, upregulation of KHC in the presynaptic neurons alone is sufficient for the induction of LTF. However, KHC is not required for the persistence of LTF. Thus, in addition to transcriptional activation in the nucleus and local protein synthesis at the synapse, our studies have identified a third component critical for long-term learning-related plasticity: the coordinated upregulation of kinesin-mediated transport.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c1","authors":["Puthanveettil SV","Monje FJ","Miniaci MC","Choi YB","Karl KA","Khandros E","Gawinowicz MA","Sheetz MP","Kandel ER"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cell.2008.11.003","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T03:24:57+00:00","issns":["0092-8674"],"issue":"5","journal":"Cell","last_mentioned_on":1233532800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19041756","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.cell.2008.11.003"],"pmcid":"PMC2635114","pmid":"19041756","pubdate":"2008-12-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"A New Component in Synaptic Plasticity: Upregulation of Kinesin in the Neurons of the Gill-Withdrawal Reflex","type":"article","volume":"135","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-component-synaptic-plasticity-upregulation-kinesin-neurons-gillwithdrawal-reflex"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4012938,"mean":5.0323237266256,"rank":2247966,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1030260,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4012938,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233274,"mean":3.987266195686,"rank":101632,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":90868,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233274,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8058,"mean":11.295804865938,"rank":5762,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":1217,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8058,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":461,"mean":13.346273913043,"rank":374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":461,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":21,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
