To make this determination, the medical records of 59 subacute outpatient stem cell transplant recipients receiving methylprednisolone (MP) were reviewed for demographic, anthropometric and medical information. Performance on the repeated sit-to-stand, 50-ft walk and 6-min walk tests were determined before and after completing a 4-week progressive exercise rehabilitation program and outcomes were compared by a paired t-test (P < 0.05). Thirty-two patients (54%) finished a treatment plan (adherent group), completing 80% of the prescribed sessions and were reevaluated. Twenty-seven patients (46%) did not complete the rehabilitation program (nonadherent group), primarily because of readmission to the hospital (18 patients, 62%). The adherent group did not significantly improve their physical performance (p > 0.05). However, a subgroup of 40% of these patients did experience clinically significant improvements in their physical performance.These findings 1) support the feasibility of having HSCT recipients receiving GC therapy to participate in an exercise-based rehabilitation program and 2) suggest that to do so can result in clinically significant improvements in functional capacity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100035ed","doi":"10.1007\/s00520-011-1352-0","first_seen_on":"2011-12-29T21:57:53+00:00","issns":["1433-7339"],"journal":"Supportive Care in Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1325195148,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22203418?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22203418","pubdate":"2011-12-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms","healthservices"],"title":"Adherence of stem cell transplant recipients receiving glucocorticoid therapy to an exercise-based rehabilitation program.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adherence-stem-cell-transplant-recipients-receiving-glucocorticoid-therapy-exercisebased-rehabilitat-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3061407,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":941221,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235621,"mean":4.2563623291744,"rank":144477,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":47438,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235621,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1022,"mean":2.5377335945152,"rank":644,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":247,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1022,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":1.2709677419355,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Social Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/NicholasMMurphy\/status\/152505620598235136","citation_ids":[511056],"posted_on":"2011-12-29T21:45:48+00:00","author":{"name":"Nick Murphy","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/978677061\/345_n_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"NicholasMMurphy","tweeter_id":"74478819","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":814},"tweet_id":"152505620598235136"}]}}
