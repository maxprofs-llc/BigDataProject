We examined the function of DSCAM and DSCAML1 in the developing mouse retina. In addition to a subset of amacrine cells, Dscam was expressed in most retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). RGCs had fasciculated dendrites and clumped cell bodies in Dscam(-\/-) mice, suggesting a role in self-avoidance. Dscaml1 was expressed in the rod circuit, and mice lacking Dscaml1 had fasciculated rod bipolar cell dendrites and clumped AII amacrine cell bodies, also indicating a role in self-avoidance. Neurons in Dscam or Dscaml1 mutant retinas stratified their processes appropriately in synaptic laminae in the inner plexiform layer, and functional synapses formed in the rod circuit in mice lacking Dscaml1. Therefore, DSCAM and DSCAML1 function similarly in self-avoidance, and are not essential for synaptic specificity in the mouse retina.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f61000319c","authors":["Fuerst PG","Bruce F","Tian M","Wei W","Elstrott J","Feller MB","Erskine L","Singer JH","Burgess RW"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neuron.2009.09.027","endpage":"497","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T02:01:01+00:00","issns":["0896-6273","08966273"],"issue":"4","journal":"Neuron","last_mentioned_on":1264118400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19945391","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.neuron.2009.09.027"],"pmid":"19945391","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"484","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"DSCAM and DSCAML1 Function in Self-Avoidance in Multiple Cell Types in the Developing Mouse Retina","type":"article","volume":"64","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dscam-dscaml1-function-selfavoidance-multiple-cell-types-developing-mouse-retina"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635017,"mean":4.9194226118571,"rank":2016806,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":946939,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635017,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231923,"mean":3.8975206491841,"rank":99653,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":91435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231923,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3776,"mean":10.043444238411,"rank":2369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":647,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3776,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":343,"mean":11.849643274854,"rank":265,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":55,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":343,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":16,"Researcher":45,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
