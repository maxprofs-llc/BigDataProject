The study was conducted on one hundred children attending Paediatric out-patient department of Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar. All the children were in the age group of 5 to 14 years. They showed markedly raised levels of serum alkaline phosphatase, whereas serum phosphorus, serum calcium levels and antistreptolycin O-titres were normal in 93% cases. None of them had any rheumatic or rheumatoid pathology. Among 15 suspected clinical rickets only three were established radiologically. Dietary and socio-economic history revealed deficient vitamin D intake and less exposure to sun. It was hypothesized that sub-clinical vitamin D deficiency could be a major cause of persistent pain in lower limbs and raised serum alkaline phosphatase could be the earliest marker of vitamin D deficiency. It was confirmed by injecting single dose of vitamin D (3 lac I. U.) which relieved bone pain and lowered the levels of serum alkaline phosphatase to normal within 14 weeks of initiation of therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9153cf058f61000cf06","authors":["Masood, H","Narang, A P","Bhat, I A","Shah, G N"],"first_seen_on":"2016-07-13T15:57:34+00:00","issns":["0019-5499"],"issue":"4","journal":"Indian journal of physiology and pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1468577884,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2620972"],"pmid":"2620972","pubdate":"1989-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology","pharmacology"],"title":"Persistent limb pain and raised serum alkaline phosphatase the earliest markers of subclinical hypovitaminosis D in Kashmir.","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/short-communication-persistent-limb-pain-raised-serum-alkaline-phosphatase-earliest-markers-subclini"},"altmetric_score":{"score":16.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":16.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8076187,"mean":6.8570931149856,"rank":495412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7578962,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8076187,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258729,"mean":11.691759523515,"rank":24919,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":233722,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258729,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145,"mean":5.8321111111111,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":134,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"8 Signs and Symptoms of Vitamin D Deficiency","url":"https:\/\/authoritynutrition.com\/vitamin-d-deficiency-symptoms\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[9657992,2551730,911516,1623131,9657999,2307313,1569607,172350,4459799,565623,4597529,602349,9658010,4987145,9658015,9658016,1550973,9658021,6143040,1437575,784421,9658027,9658030,189326,2829274,1100671,4731682,4357097,1494620,9658038,2541506,1649353,2204767,883094,9658043,9658046,2283415,385619,1068515,4073355],"posted_on":"2016-07-13T04:35:00+00:00","summary":"Vitamin D is an extremely important vitamin that has powerful effects on several systems throughout the body (1).
