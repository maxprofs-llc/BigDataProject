Antibodies against amyloid \u03b2-peptide (A\u03b2) bind to amyloid plaques and induce their clearance by microglia via Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis. Dysfunctions of microglia may play a pivotal role in AD pathogenesis and could result in reduced efficacy of antibody-mediated A\u03b2 clearance. Recently, heterozygous mutations in the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), a microglial gene involved in phagocytosis, were genetically linked to late onset AD Loss of TREM2 reduces the ability of microglia to engulf A\u03b2. We have now investigated whether loss of TREM2 affects the efficacy of immunotherapeutic approaches. We show that anti-A\u03b2 antibodies stimulate A\u03b2 uptake and amyloid plaque clearance in a dose-dependent manner in the presence or absence of TREM2. However, TREM2-deficient N9 microglial cell lines, macrophages as well as primary microglia showed significantly reduced uptake of antibody-bound A\u03b2 and as a consequence reduced clearance of amyloid plaques. Titration experiments revealed that reduced efficacy of amyloid plaque clearance by Trem2 knockout cells can be compensated by elevating the concentration of therapeutic antibodies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6163cf058f61000723b","authors":["Xiang, Xianyuan","Werner, Georg","Bohrmann, Bernd","Liesz, Arthur","Mazaheri, Fargol","Capell, Anja","Feederle, Regina","Knuesel, Irene","Kleinberger, Gernot","Haass, Christian","Xianyuan Xiang","Georg Werner","Bernd Bohrmann","Arthur Liesz","Fargol Mazaheri","Anja Capell","Regina Feederle","Irene Knuesel","Gernot Kleinberger","Christian Haass"],"doi":"10.15252\/emmm.201606370","endpage":"1004","first_seen_on":"2016-07-13T12:24:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1757-4684","1757-4676"],"issue":"9","journal":"EMBO Molecular Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1504869115,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27402340?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27402340","http:\/\/embomolmed.embopress.org\/content\/8\/9\/992"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/embomolmed.embopress.org\/content\/embomm\/8\/9\/992.full.pdf","pmid":"27402340","pubdate":"2016-07-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"EMBO Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"e201606370","subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"TREM2 deficiency reduces the efficacy of immunotherapeutic amyloid clearance","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/trem2-deficiency-reduces-efficacy-immunotherapeutic-amyloid-clearance"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8386234,"mean":7.0650459988331,"rank":3644245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4621725,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8386234,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261323,"mean":11.771819540643,"rank":104691,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":152002,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261323,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":666,"mean":15.809491729323,"rank":397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":257,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":666,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":13.113545454545,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":22,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
