The objective of this study was to determine ESBL-PE prevalence and to characterize ESBL genes in Burkina Faso.\nDuring 2\u00a0months (June-July 2014), 1602 clinical samples were sent for bacteriologic investigations to the microbiology laboratories of the tree main hospitals of Burkina Faso. Isolates were identified by mass spectrometry using a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) BioTyper. Antibiotic susceptibility was tested using the disk diffusion method on M\u00fcller-Hinton agar. The different ESBL genes in potential ESBL-producing isolates were detected by PCR and double stranded DNA sequencing. Escherichia coli phylogenetic groups were determined using a PCR-based method.\nESBL-PE frequency was 58\u00a0% (179 strains among the 308 Enterobacteriaceae isolates identified in the collected samples; 45\u00a0% in outpatients and 70\u00a0% in hospitalized patients). The CTX-M-1 group was dominant (94\u00a0%, CTX-M-15 enzyme), followed by the CTX-M-9 group (4\u00a0%). ESBL producers were more often found in E. coli (67.5\u00a0%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (26\u00a0%) isolates. E. coli isolates (n\u2009=\u2009202; 60\u00a0% of all Enterobacteriaceae samples) were distributed in eight phylogenetic groups (A\u2009=\u200949, B1\u2009=\u200915, B2\u2009=\u200943, C\u2009=\u200922, Clade I\u2009=\u20097, D\u2009=\u200937, F\u2009=\u200913 and 16 unknown); 22 strains belonged to the sequence type ST131. No association between a specific strain and ESBL production was detected.\nThis report shows the alarming spread of ESBL genes in Burkina Faso. Public health efforts should focus on education (population and healthcare professionals), surveillance and promotion of correct and restricted antibiotic use to limit their dissemination.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007bd","authors":["Ouedraogo, Abdoul-Salam","Sanou, Mahamadou","Kissou, Aim\u00e9e","Sanou, Soufiane","Solar\u00e9, Hermann","Kabor\u00e9, Firmin","Poda, Armel","Aberkane, Salim","Bouzinbi, Nicolas","Sano, Idrissa","Nacro, Boubacar","Sangar\u00e9, Lassana","Carri\u00e8re, Christian","Decr\u00e9, Dominique","Ou\u00e9graogo, Rasmata","Jean-Pierre, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne","Godreuil, Sylvain","Abdoul-Salam Ouedraogo","Mahamadou Sanou","Aim\u00e9e Kissou","Soufiane Sanou","Hermann Solar\u00e9","Firmin Kabor\u00e9","Armel Poda","Salim Aberkane","Nicolas Bouzinbi","Idrissa Sano","Boubacar Nacro","Lassana Sangar\u00e9","Christian Carri\u00e8re","Dominique Decr\u00e9","Rasmata Ou\u00e9graogo","H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Jean-Pierre","Sylvain Godreuil"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12879-016-1655-3","first_seen_on":"2016-07-13T11:42:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-2334"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1468477657,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27400864?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12879-016-1655-3"],"pmcid":"PMC4939587","pmid":"27400864","pubdate":"2016-07-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Parasitology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Tropical Medicine","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"High prevalence of extended-spectrum \u00df-lactamase producing enterobacteriaceae among clinical isolates in Burkina Faso","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/high-prevalence-extendedspectrum-%C3%9Flactamase-producing-enterobacteriaceae-among-clinical-isolates-bur-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8071125,"mean":6.8533209909723,"rank":4266874,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2240173,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8071125,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258679,"mean":11.691454317723,"rank":141323,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":91796,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258679,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3654,"mean":3.9351617848344,"rank":2098,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3654,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":188,"mean":3.473743315508,"rank":99,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":80,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":188,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":5},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":4,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Unspecified":2,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"AU":1,"VE":1},"mendeley":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AntibioticResis\/statuses\/753172043919597568","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9652362],"posted_on":"2016-07-13T10:19:43+00:00","author":{"name":"AntibioticResistance","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/551766191962746880\/GlO2QteM_normal.jpeg","description":"Keep abreast of the latest developments in the fight against Antibiotic Resistance #AMR with the latest publications curated from PubMed.
