Hence, it is not paradoxical that, similar to their normal counterparts, most mature B cell lymphoma subtypes are critically dependent on microenvironmental cues. Such external signals are sensed by various receptors present on the malignant cells, including the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), eliciting a range of cellular responses, including proliferation but also anergy and apoptosis, often with disease-specific patterns. Critically, the TLR signaling pathways are intertwined with other receptor pathways in malignant B cells, most notably the B-cell receptor pathway, and converge on NF-\u03baB, leading to its activation. In the present review, we summarize the literature on TLR expression and functionality and its impact on NF-\u03baB activation in different B cell malignancies including chronic lymphocytic leukemia where TLR9 induces activation, cell proliferation and chemoresistance in a proportion of patients while apoptosis can be induced in others. Additionally, we also discuss the therapeutic potential of strategies targeting TLR signaling in lymphoma.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f610003507","authors":["Ntoufa, Stavroula","Vilia, Maria Giovanna","Stamatopoulos, Kostas","Ghia, Paolo","Muzio, Marta"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.semcancer.2016.07.001","first_seen_on":"2016-07-13T13:27:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1096-3650","1044579X"],"journal":"Seminars in Cancer Biology","last_mentioned_on":1468435566,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27402288?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27402288","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Toll-like receptors signaling: a complex network for NF-\u03baB activation in B-cell lymphoid malignancies","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tolllike-receptors-signaling-complex-network-nf%CE%BAb-activation-bcell-lymphoid-malignancies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8072037,"mean":6.8520742736971,"rank":6989873,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8072037,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258665,"mean":11.691096866978,"rank":217756,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258665,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":315,"mean":3.2005095541401,"rank":253,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":315,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.76818181818182,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
