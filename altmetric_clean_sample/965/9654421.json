PM"],"citation":{"abstract":"This is the first study to investigate the vasculoangiogenic effects of cilostazol on endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This double-blind, placebo-controlled study included 71 patients (37 received 200 mg\/d cilostazol and 34 received placebo for 12 weeks). Use of cilostazol, but not placebo, significantly increased circulating EPC (kinase insert domain receptor(+)CD34(+)) counts (percentage changes: 149.0% [67.9%-497.8%] vs 71.9% [-31.8% to 236.5%], P = .024) and improved triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (P = .002 and P = .003, respectively). Plasma levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A165 and FMD significantly increased (72.5% [32.9%-120.4%] vs -5.8% [-46.0% to 57.6%], P = .001; 232.8% \u00b1 83.1% vs -46.9% \u00b1 21.5%, P = .003, respectively) in cilostazol-treated patients. Changes in the plasma triglyceride levels significantly inversely correlated with the changes in the VEGF-A165 levels and FMD. Cilostazol significantly enhanced the mobilization of EPCs and improved endothelium-dependent function by modifying some metabolic and angiogenic markers in patients at high risk of CVD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002256","authors":["Chao, Ting-Hsing","Chen, I-Chih","Lee, Cheng-Han","Chen, Ju-Yi","Tsai, Wei-Chuan","Li, Yi-Heng","Tseng, Shih-Ya","Tsai, Liang-Miin","Tseng, Wei-Kung"],"doi":"10.1177\/0003319715606249","endpage":"646","first_seen_on":"2016-07-13T13:43:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1940-1574","0003-3197"],"issue":"7","journal":"Angiology","last_mentioned_on":1468411789,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27401788?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27401788","pubdate":"2016-07-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"638","title":"Cilostazol Enhances Mobilization of Circulating Endothelial Progenitor Cells and Improves Endothelium-Dependent Function in Patients at High Risk of Cardiovascular Disease","type":"article","volume":"67","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cilostazol-enhances-mobilization-circulating-endothelial-progenitor-cells-improves-endotheliumdepend"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8072037,"mean":6.8520742736971,"rank":6989924,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8072037,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258665,"mean":11.691374447159,"rank":217787,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258665,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":376,"mean":2.2111786666667,"rank":277,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":376,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":2.0785714285714,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/VEGFRSSfeeds\/statuses\/753199751902797824","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9654421],"posted_on":"2016-07-13T12:09:49+00:00","author":{"name":"VEGF RSS Feeds","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/516588600\/VEGF_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"VEGFRSSfeeds","tweeter_id":"88511740","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":363},"tweet_id":"753199751902797824"}]}}
