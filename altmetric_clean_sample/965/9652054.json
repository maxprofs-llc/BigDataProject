While seizures in TLE originate in structures such as hippocampus, amygdala, and temporal cortex, they propagate through a crucial relay: the midline\/intralaminar thalamus. Prior studies have shown that pharmacological inhibition of midline thalamus attenuates limbic seizures. Here, we examined a recently developed technology, Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs), as a means of chemogenetic silencing to attenuate limbic seizures. Adult, male rats were electrically kindled from the amygdala, and injected with virus coding for inhibitory (hM4Di) DREADDs into the midline\/intralaminar thalamus. When treated with the otherwise inert ligand Clozapine-N-Oxide (CNO) at doses of 2.5, 5, and 10mg\/kg, electrographic and behavioral seizure manifestations were suppressed in comparison to vehicle. At higher doses, we found complete blockade of seizure activity in a subset of subjects. CNO displayed a sharp time-response profile, with significant seizure attenuation seen 20-30min post injection, in comparison to 10 and 40min post injection. Seizures in animals injected with a control vector (i.e., no DREADD) were unaffected by CNO administration. These data underscore the crucial role of the midline\/intralaminar thalamus in the propagation of seizures, specifically in the amygdala kindling model, and provide validation of chemogenetic silencing of limbic seizures.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002897","authors":["Wicker, Evan","Forcelli, Patrick A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.expneurol.2016.07.003","first_seen_on":"2016-07-13T11:26:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1090-2430","00144886"],"issue":"Pt A","journal":"Experimental Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1468408810,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27404844?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27404844?dopt=Abstract&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27404844?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27404844","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Chemogenetic silencing of the midline and intralaminar thalamus blocks amygdala-kindled seizures","type":"article","volume":"283","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chemogenetic-silencing-midline-intralaminar-thalamus-blocks-amygdalakindled-seizures"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8072037,"mean":6.8520742736971,"rank":3473807,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4483998,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8072037,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258665,"mean":11.69140885473,"rank":103898,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":150026,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258665,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1281,"mean":3.8201734375,"rank":597,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":658,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1281,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":3.1092307692308,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
