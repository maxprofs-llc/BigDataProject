This study was designed to investigate extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistant E. coli strains, CTX-M distributions and the genetic lineage of blaCTX-M -carrying plasmids from urban and slaughterhouse wastewaters. The level of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant E. coli in slaughterhouse wastewater entering the WWTP was negligible compared to that of urban wastewater. The blaCTX-M-1 gene was predominant in slaughterhouse wastewater whereas diverse blaCTX-M genes were encountered in urban wastewater and WWTP outlet. Characterization of the main CTX-M-producing E. coli isolates by antibiotic resistance phenotyping, genotyping and typing of plasmids carrying blaCTX-M genes revealed that blaCTX-M-1 and blaCTX-M-15 genes were harbored by the predominant blaCTX-M-1 IncI1\/ST3 and blaCTX-M-15 F31:A4:B1 plasmids, which were recovered from unrelated E. coli genotypes in both slaughterhouse and urban wastewaters. This study highlighted the spread of predominant blaCTX-M-1 and blaCTX-M-15 plasmid lineages in diverse E. coli genotypes from humans and food-producing animals, their mixing in WWTP and final release into the aquatic environment. This could have a serious negative impact on public health and requires further evaluation. This article is protected by copyright.
