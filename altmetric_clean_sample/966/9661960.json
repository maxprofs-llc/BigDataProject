However, it has yet to be fully exploited in order to make it available for the use of mankind. Blue energy harvesting is a challenging task as the kinetic energy from ocean waves is irregular in amplitude and is at low frequencies. Though electromagnetic generators (EMGs) are well-known for harvesting mechanical kinetic energies, they have a crucial limitation for blue energy conversion. Indeed, the output voltage of EMGs can be impractically low at the low frequencies of ocean waves. In contrast, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are highly suitable for blue energy harvesting as they can effectively harvest mechanical energies from low frequencies (<1 Hz) to relatively high frequencies (\u223ckHz) and are also low-cost, lightweight, and easy to fabricate. Several important steps have been taken by Wang's group to develop TENG technology for blue energy harvesting. In this Perspective, we describe some of the recent progress and also address concerns related to durable packaging of TENGs in consideration of harsh marine environments and power management for an efficient power transfer and distribution for commercial applications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006816","authors":["Usman Khan"],"doi":"10.1021\/acsnano.6b04213","first_seen_on":"2016-07-13T19:44:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1936-0851","1936-086X"],"issue":"7","journal":"ACS Nano","last_mentioned_on":1468706883,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acsnano.6b04213"],"pmid":"27408982","pubdate":"2016-07-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Triboelectric Nanogenerators for Blue Energy Harvesting","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/triboelectric-nanogenerators-blue-energy-harvesting"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8078414,"mean":6.8578859978971,"rank":4271263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2242093,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8078414,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258758,"mean":11.690830168845,"rank":141306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":91948,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258758,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4924,"mean":11.972653666464,"rank":3368,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4924,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":202,"mean":11.338865671642,"rank":153,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":202,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
