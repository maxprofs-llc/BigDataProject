By using wavefunction overlaps, it is possible to analyze the effects of varying wavefunction models, molecular orbitals, and one-electron basis sets. The computation of wavefunction overlaps eliminates the inherent ambiguity connected to more rudimentary wavefunction analysis protocols, such as visualization of orbitals or comparing selected physical observables. Instead, wavefunction overlaps allow processing the many-electron wavefunctions in their full inherent complexity. The presented method is particularly effective for excited state calculations as it allows for automatic monitoring of changes in the ordering of the excited states. A numerical demonstration based on multireference computations of two test systems, the selenoacrolein molecule and an iridium complex, is presented.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cee","authors":["Felix Plasser","Felix Plasser","Leticia Gonz\u00e1lez"],"doi":"10.1063\/1.4958462","first_seen_on":"2016-07-13T20:49:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1089-7690"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Chemical Physics","last_mentioned_on":1178137980,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1063\/1.4958462"],"pmid":"27421390","pubdate":"2016-07-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"AIP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"021103","subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"title":"Communication: Unambiguous comparison of many-electron wavefunctions through their overlaps","type":"article","volume":"145","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/communication-unambiguous-comparison-manyelectron-wavefunctions-through-overlaps"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.384,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.384},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5351400,"mean":6.2613966844956,"rank":948333,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":4402574,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5351400,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102551,"mean":9.6425335543639,"rank":19617,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":82934,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102551,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4345,"mean":2.3492532228361,"rank":280,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":4056,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4345,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":2.2787246376812,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":67,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
