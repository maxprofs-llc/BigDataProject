To date, there has been no attempt to systematically assess the breadth of the problem in Canada. To address this gap, we undertook a scoping review to enhance understanding of resident-to-resident abuse in LTC homes. A redacted Canadian data set on resident-to-resident abuse is also reported on. Nine electronic literature databases were searched; a total of 784 abstracts were identified, but only 32 satisfied the inclusion criteria. The majority of records (75%) were retrospective case studies, qualitative studies, and reviews\/commentaries. Of these, only 14 focused exclusively on resident-to-resident abuse. The redacted Canadian data set suggests resident-to-resident abuse makes up approximately one-third of reported abuse cases. Recommendations for future research, clinical practice, and policy are provided to raise awareness of this phenomenon to help decrease its incidence.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000dc7","authors":["Lynn McDonald","Christine Sheppard","Sander L Hitzig","Tal Spalter","Avantika Mathur","Jason Singh Mukhi"],"doi":"10.1017\/s0714980815000094","first_seen_on":"2015-03-11T13:20:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1710-1107"],"journal":"Canadian Journal on Aging","last_mentioned_on":1426716465,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25752919?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25752919"],"pmid":"25752919","pubdate":"2015-03-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Nursing","Social Sciences"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Resident-to-Resident Abuse: A Scoping Review.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/residenttoresident-abuse-scoping-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8453853,"mean":7.1044093184897,"rank":6110847,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2039383,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8453853,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":204305,"mean":9.4876163853865,"rank":130216,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":62313,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":204305,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184,"mean":3.0786994535519,"rank":152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":3.5083333333333,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
