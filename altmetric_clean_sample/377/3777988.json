Activity of these neurons is significantly modulated by GABAergic, parvalbumin-containing, fast-spiking interneurons, the majority of which are enveloped by specialized structures of extracellular matrix called perineuronal nets (PNNs), which are integral to the maintenance of many types of plasticity. Using a conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure, we found that removal of PNNs primarily from the prelimbic region of the mPFC of adult, male, Sprague Dawley rats impaired the acquisition and reconsolidation of a cocaine-induced CPP memory. This impairment was accompanied by a decrease in the number of c-Fos-positive cells surrounded by PNNs. Following removal of PNNs, the frequency of inhibitory currents in mPFC pyramidal neurons was decreased; but following cocaine-induced CPP, both frequency and amplitude of inhibitory currents were decreased. Our findings suggest that cocaine-induced plasticity is impaired by removal of prelimbic mPFC PNNs and that PNNs may be a therapeutic target for disruption of cocaine CPP memories.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e79","authors":["Megan Slaker","Lynn Churchill","Ryan P.
