We tested whether Cu would be mobilized in soils receiving excessive loads of manure, both from recently added and from aged fractions. To discriminate between these Cu sources, manure was labelled with 65Cu. After soil application of 0, 15, and 30 Mg manure ha-1, leachate was collected in free-draining lysimeters (40 cm depth) under undisturbed soil over a 53 day period. Determining total amounts of Cu, and the fractions of 65Cu in leachate and soil profile enabled us to trace the translocation of Cu deriving from labelled manure. More than 84% of the applied Cu was retained in the top 2 cm of soil. Less than 0.01% of the applied Cu were overall detected in the leachate. Of this amount, however, 38% (\u00b18.9 SE) was leached within 8 days after application. The total Cu concentration in leachates (32-164 \u00b5g l-1) frequently exceeded the Chinese groundwater quality standard of 50 \u00b5g l-1. The added 65Cu however, accounted for less than 3.6% of the total Cu leaching load, suggesting that Cu from older sources and\/or geological background controls contamination, regardless of current land management.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027ef","authors":["Anne Ostermann"],"doi":"10.1021\/es504945e","first_seen_on":"2015-03-10T13:12:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0013-936X"],"journal":"Environmental Science & Technology","last_mentioned_on":1425993112,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/es504945e"],"pmid":"25742507","pubdate":"2015-03-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Tracing copper derived from pig manure in calcareous soils and soil leachates by 65Cu labeling.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tracing-copper-derived-pig-manure-calcareous-soils-soil-leachates-65cu-labeling"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4855319,"mean":5.7871341955397,"rank":2576767,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1620912,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4855319,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145806,"mean":10.171250793869,"rank":82641,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":46846,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145806,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4976,"mean":9.1255216080402,"rank":3190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":1069,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4976,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228,"mean":10.450149779736,"rank":146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":64,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
