Clonal evolution, disease initiation and progression are influenced by genetic alterations, often affecting cytokine signaling and gene expression. This review outlines somatic changes discovered in myeloproliferative neoplasms and how these genetic aberrations influence the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative neoplasms. Furthermore, genetic responses to drug treatments in myeloproliferative neoplasms are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007058","authors":["Them NC","Kralovics R"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11899-013-0184-z","endpage":"306","first_seen_on":"2015-03-11T18:09:56+00:00","issns":["1558-822X","1558-8211"],"issue":"4","journal":"Current Hematologic Malignancy Reports","last_mentioned_on":1436763814,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24190690?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s11899-013-0184-z"],"pmid":"24190690","pubdate":"2013-11-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Geriatrics\/Gerontology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Hematology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"299","subjects":["neoplasms","hematology"],"title":"Genetic Basis of MPN: Beyond JAK2-V617F","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genetic-basis-mpn-beyond-jak2v617f"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5347583,"mean":6.2572995940991,"rank":1243156,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":4082134,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5347583,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":154851,"mean":10.345158540523,"rank":48123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":106119,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":154851,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107,"mean":2.6014528301887,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":94,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.15,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
