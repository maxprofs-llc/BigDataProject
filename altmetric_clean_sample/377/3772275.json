Here we present an alternative approach using the adjoint of the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, which provides source-receptor relationships at highly-resolved sectoral, spatial, and temporal scales. While damages resulting from anthropogenic emissions of BC are strongly correlated with population and premature death, we found little correlation between damages and emission magnitude, suggesting that controls on the largest emissions may not be the most efficient means of reducing damages resulting from anthropogenic BC emissions. Rather, the best proxy for locations with damaging BC emissions is locations where premature deaths occur. Onroad diesel and nonroad vehicle emissions are the largest contributors to premature deaths attributed to exposure to BC, while onroad gasoline emissions cause the highest deaths per amount emitted. Emissions in fall and winter contribute to more premature deaths (and more per amount emitted) than emissions in spring and summer. Overall, these results show the value of high-resolution source attribution for determining the locations, seasons, and sectors for which BC emission controls have the most effective health benefits.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027ef","authors":["Matthew Douglas Turner","Turner MD","Henze DK","Hakami A","Zhao S","Resler J","Carmichael G","Stanier CO","Baek J","Sandu A","Russell AG","Nenes A","Jeong GR","Capps S","Percell P","Pinder RW","Napelenok SL","Bash J","Chai T","Matthew D.
