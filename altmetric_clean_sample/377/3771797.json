However, the cost and side effects secondary to supraphysiologic dosages of growth factors warrant investigation of alternative methods of stimulating osteogenesis for clinical utilization. In this work, we describe growth factor independent osteogenic induction of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) on a novel nanoparticulate mineralized collagen glycosaminoglycan scaffold (MC-GAG). hMSCs demonstrated elevated osteogenic gene expression and mineralization on MC-GAG with minimal to no effect upon addition of BMP-2 when compared to non-mineralized scaffolds (Col-GAG). To investigate the intracellular pathways responsible for the increase in osteogenesis, we examined the canonical and non-canonical pathways downstream from BMP receptor activation. Constitutive Smad1\/5 phosphorylation with nuclear translocation occurred on MC-GAG independent of BMP-2, whereas Smad1\/5 phosphorylation depended on BMP-2 stimulation on Col-GAG. When non-canonical BMPR signaling molecules were examined, ERK1\/2 phosphorylation was found to be decreased in MC-GAG but elevated in Col-GAG. No differences in Smad2\/3 or p38 activation were detected. Collectively, these results demonstrated that MC-GAG scaffolds induce osteogenesis without exogenous BMP-2 addition via endogenous activation of the canonical BMP receptor signaling pathway.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023e8","authors":["Ren X","Bischoff D","Weisgerber DW","Lewis MS","Tu V","Yamaguchi DT","Miller TA","Harley BA","Lee JC"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.biomaterials.2015.01.059","first_seen_on":"2015-03-10T16:58:33+00:00","funders":["niams","niehs"],"issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Biomaterials","last_mentioned_on":1426009486,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25736501"],"pmid":"25736501","pubdate":"2015-03-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Osteogenesis on nanoparticulate mineralized collagen scaffolds via autogenous activation of the canonical BMP receptor signaling pathway.","type":"article","volume":"50","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/osteogenesis-nanoparticulate-mineralized-collagen-scaffolds-via-autogenous-activation-canonical-bmp"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4855319,"mean":5.7871341955397,"rank":2237583,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2494806,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4855319,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145803,"mean":10.172784776615,"rank":68936,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":71956,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145803,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1742,"mean":4.7004916714532,"rank":622,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":1080,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1742,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":2.2682692307692,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
