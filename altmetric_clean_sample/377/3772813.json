We have shown that argininosuccinate synthase (ASS), a hepatic enzyme of the urea cycle, accumulates in circulation within 1h after treatment with both LPS alone and hepatotoxic combination of LPS and D-Galactosamine. These findings indicate ASS as a sensitive biomarker of liver responses to bacterial endotoxin. Furthermore, we suggest that the ASS release represents a potential counteracting liver reaction to LPS, and demonstrates anti-LPS activity of recombinant ASS (rASS) in vitro and in rodent models of endotoxemia in vivo. rASS physically bound to LPS, as indicated by a gel shift assay, and suppressed Escherichia coli growth in cultures consistent with direct antimicrobial properties of ASS. rASS reduced LPS cytotoxicity, TNF-\u03b1 production, and increased cell viability in cultured mouse macrophages, even when added one hour following LPS challenge. Intraperitoneal injection of rASS (5 mg\/kg) after treatment with a high dose of LPS remarkably increased survival of rodents, with a concomitant decrease of sepsis markers TNF-\u03b1, C-reactive protein (CRP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in blood. These results suggest that the endogenous ASS constitutes a novel liver-derived component of the innate immune response to bacterial LPS, and that recombinant ASS could mitigate the lethal effects of bacterial endotoxins during sepsis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b0e","authors":["Prima V","Wang A","Molina G","Wang KK","Svetlov SI"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.intimp.2011.03.016","first_seen_on":"2015-03-10T20:58:19+00:00","funders":["niaid"],"issns":[],"issue":"9","journal":"International Immunopharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1426021065,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21481813"],"pmid":"21481813","pubdate":"2011-04-12T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["pharmacology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Inhibition of LPS toxicity by hepatic argininosuccinate synthase (ASS): novel roles for ASS in innate immune responses to bacterial infection.","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inhibition-lps-toxicity-hepatic-argininosuccinate-synthase-ass-novel-roles-ass-innate-immune-respons"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4855454,"mean":5.7883919127654,"rank":3437138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":792386,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4855454,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145815,"mean":10.17881147215,"rank":105943,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":24436,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145815,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":720,"mean":1.5736161335188,"rank":382,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":246,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":720,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":1.1792682926829,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
