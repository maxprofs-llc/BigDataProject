[Subjects and Methods] Thirty-seven subjects with induced DOMS were randomized into either Group I (control, n=19) or Group II (KT, n=18). Outcome measures were recorded before the intervention (application of KT) and at 24, 48, and 72 hours after the intervention. DOMS was induced, and muscle thickness was measured using ultrasonic radiography. Maximal voluntary isometric contraction (%MVIC) was measured via electromyography (EMG). Subjective pain was measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS). [Results] Group I exhibited a positive correlation between muscle thickness and elapsed time from intervention (24, 48, and 72 hours post induction of DOMS); they also showed a significant decrease in MVIC(%). Group II showed significant increases in muscle thickness up to the 48-hour interval post induction of DOMS, along with a significant decrease in MVIC (%). However, in contrast to Group I, Group II did not show a significant difference in muscle thickness or MVIC (%) at the 72-hour interval in comparison with the values prior to DOMS induction. [Conclusion] In adults with DOMS, activation of muscles by applying KT was found to be an effective and faster method of recovering muscle strength than rest alone.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a8f","authors":["Lee YS","Bae SH","Hwang JA","Kim KY"],"doi":"10.1589\/jpts.27.457","first_seen_on":"2015-03-11T23:24:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":[],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Physical Therapy Science","last_mentioned_on":1483228800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25729190"],"pmcid":"PMC4339160","pmid":"25729190","pubdate":"2015-03-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"title":"The effects of kinesio taping on architecture, strength and pain of muscles in delayed onset muscle soreness of biceps brachii.","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-kinesio-taping-architecture-strength-pain-muscles-delayed-onset-muscle-soreness-biceps-brach"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8026519,"mean":6.7991430779784,"rank":3227401,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4742092,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8026519,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":202089,"mean":9.3520152111952,"rank":70964,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":129143,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":202089,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":921,"mean":3.2599717391304,"rank":288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":622,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":921,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":3.4897333333333,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
