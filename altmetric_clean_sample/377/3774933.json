The objectives of this feasibility study were: (1) to explore whether or not CIRCuiTS-a new computerised cognitive remediation therapy programme developed in England-improves visual episodic memory and other cognitive domains in young adults with early course schizophrenia; and (2) to evaluate acceptability of the CIRCuiTS programme in French-Canadians. Three participants with visual episodic memory impairments at baseline were recruited from clinical settings in Canada, and consented to participate. Neuropsychological, clinical and social functioning was evaluated at baseline and post-treatment. Intervention involved 40 sessions of cognitive remediation. First, the reliable change index (RCI) revealed that each participant demonstrated significant post-therapy change in episodic memory and in other cognitive domains. The response profile was characterised by the use of organisational strategies. Second, the treatment was considered acceptable to participants in terms of session frequency (number of sessions per week), intensity (hours per week; total hours), and number of missed sessions and total completed sessions. This preliminary study yielded encouraging data demonstrating the feasibility of the CIRCuiTS programme in French-Canadian young adults with schizophrenia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f61000148a","authors":["Caroline Cellard","Clare Reeder","Andr\u00e9e-Anne Paradis-Giroux","Marc-Andr\u00e9 Roy","Elsa Gilbert","Hans Ivers","Roch-Hugo Bouchard","Michel Maziade","Til Wykes","Cellard C","Reeder C","Paradis-Giroux AA","Roy MA","Gilbert E","Ivers H","Bouchard RH","Maziade M","Wykes T"],"doi":"10.1080\/09602011.2015.1019891","first_seen_on":"2015-03-11T10:13:22+00:00","funders":["niehs","cihr"],"issns":["1464-0694","0960-2011"],"issue":"3","journal":"Neuropsychological Rehabilitation","last_mentioned_on":1447417051,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25753694?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/09602011.2015.1019891?ai=2hw&mi=hph1f7&af=R"],"pmid":"25753694","pubdate":"2015-03-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine","psychology","neurology"],"title":"A feasibility study of a new computerised cognitive remediation for young adults with schizophrenia","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/feasibility-study-new-computerised-cognitive-remediation-young-adults-schizophrenia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6564711,"mean":6.0829954575298,"rank":4855608,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":964859,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6564711,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171252,"mean":9.9772370730683,"rank":122009,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":29667,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171252,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244,"mean":4.4681893004115,"rank":173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":6.7666666666667,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
