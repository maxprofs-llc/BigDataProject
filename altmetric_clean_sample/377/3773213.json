Their toxicity, however, presents a major challenge for microbial synthesis. Here we evolved limonene tolerant yeast and sequenced six strains across the 200 generation evolutionary time course. Mutations were found in the tricalbin proteins Tcb2p and Tcb3p. Genomic reconstruction in the parent strain showed that truncation of a single protein (tTcb3p(1-989)), but not its complete deletion, was sufficient to recover the evolved phenotype improving limonene fitness by nine-fold. tTcb3p(1-989) increased tolerance towards two other monoterpenes (\u03b2-pinene and myrcene) by 11- and 8-fold, respectively, and tolerance towards the bio-jet fuel blend AMJ-700t (10% cymene, 50% limonene, 40% farnesene) by 4-fold. tTcb3p(1-989) is the first example of successful engineering of phase tolerance and creates opportunities for the production of the highly toxic C10 alkenes in yeast.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022c6","authors":["Timothy C.
