The banana peel extract (BPE) showed good activity against 1 Gram-positive and 3 Gram-negative pathogens, including Lactococcus garvieae, Photobacteria damsella, Vibrio alginolyticus and Vibrio parahemolyticus especially in prawn pathogen of L. garvieae strain, which were carried out by a disk diffusion method. Prawn received BPE via injection administration at 1-6 \u03bcg (g prawn)(-1) significantly increased total haemocyte count (THC), hyaline cell (HC), granular cell (GC), phenoloxidase (PO) activity and phagocytic activity against L. garvieae from 3 to 6 days, and significantly increased clearance efficiency against L. garvieae and a significantly decreased coagulation time of prawn from 1 to 6 days. Prawn injected with BPE at 6.0 \u03bcg (g prawn)(-1) for 6 days showed significantly increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, but significantly decreased respiratory bursts (RBs) of per haemocyte. Survival rates of M. rosenbergii injected with BPE at concentrations of 1, 3 and 6 \u03bcg (g prawn)(-1) were significantly higher than those injected with saline control after challenge with L. garvieae for 4-6 days, and the respective relative survival percentages of prawn were 28.6%, 38.1%, and 47.8%, respectively at 6 days. The sublethal time of prawns that had received saline and BPE at 1, 3 and 6 \u03bcg (g prawn)(-1) for 6 days and then were transferred from 28 \u00b0C to 14 \u00b0C were 69.4, 79.8, 83.6, and 90.2 h, respectively. It was concluded that the BPE can be used as the bacteriostat, and immunostimulant and physiological regulator for prawn through injection administration to enhance immunity, physiological responses, and resistance against L. garvieae.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028d8","authors":["Rattanavichai W","Cheng W"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.fsi.2014.05.031","first_seen_on":"2015-03-11T00:45:22+00:00","issns":["1050-4648"],"issue":"","journal":"Fish & Shellfish Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1426034704,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24906123?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24906123","pubdate":"2014-06-07T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Fisheries Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Effects of hot-water extract of banana (Musa acuminata) fruit's peel on the antibacterial activity, and anti-hypothermal stress, immune responses and disease resistance of the giant freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbegii.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-hotwater-extract-banana-musa-acuminata-fruits-peel-antibacterial-activity-antihypothermal-st"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4859598,"mean":5.7906869191028,"rank":4066069,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4859598,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146086,"mean":10.184333723517,"rank":121472,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146086,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":714,"mean":0.961301542777,"rank":395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":714,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":0.81988405797101,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
