However, the method is time-consuming because it requires restriction digestion of the PCR products in DNA cloning and the construction of new vectors containing a suitable antibiotic-resistance cassette for the selection of A. baumannii merodiploids. Moreover, the availability of restriction sites and the selection of recombinant bacteria harboring a desired chimeric plasmid are limited, making the construction of chimeric plasmid more difficult. We describe a rapid and easy cloning method for markerless gene deletion in A. baumannii, which has no limitation regarding the availability of restriction sites and allows for easy selection of the clones carrying the desired chimeric plasmid. Notably, it is not necessary to construct the new vectors in our method. This method utilizes direct cloning of blunt-ended DNA fragments, in which upstream and downstream regions of the target gene are fused with an antibiotic-resistance cassette via overlap extension PCR, into a blunt-ended suicide vector developed for blunt-ended cloning. Importantly, the antibiotic-resistance cassette is combined outside the downstream region to easily select the recombinants carrying the desired plasmid and eliminate both the antibiotic-resistance cassette via homologous recombination and the necessity of constructing the new vectors. This strategy was applied to functional analysis of the genes associated with the iron acquisition of A. baumannii ATCC 19606 and ompA gene deletion in other A. baumannii strains. Consequently, the proposed method is invaluable for markerless gene deletion in multidrug-resistant A. baumannii.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022c6","authors":["Man Hwan Oh","Je Chul Lee","Jungmin Kim","Chul Hee Choi","Kyudong Han"],"doi":"10.1128\/aem.03975-14","first_seen_on":"2015-03-10T19:53:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1098-5336"],"journal":"Applied & Environmental Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1426017132,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25746991?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25746991","pubdate":"2015-03-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Simple method for markerless gene deletion of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/simple-method-markerless-gene-deletion-multidrugresistant-acinetobacter-baumannii-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4855454,"mean":5.7883919127654,"rank":4062919,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4855454,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145810,"mean":10.179079933338,"rank":121365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145810,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4239,"mean":4.5535611137329,"rank":3717,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4239,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110,"mean":5.468623853211,"rank":94,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
