We previously reported cytotoxicity associated with Artemis over-expression and subsequently characterized the human Artemis promoter with the intention to provide Artemis expression that is non-toxic yet sufficient to support immunodevelopment. Here we compared the human Artemis promoter (APro) to the moderate-strength human PGK promoter and the strong human EF1\u03b1 promoter to regulate expression of Artemis after <i>ex vivo<\/i> lentiviral transduction of HSCs in a murine model of SCID-A. Recipient animals treated with the PGK-Artemis vector exhibited moderate repopulation of their immune compartment, yet demonstrated a defective proliferative T lymphocyte response to <i>in vitro<\/i> antigen stimulation. Animals treated with the EF1\u03b1-Artemis vector displayed high levels of T lymphocytes but an absence of B lymphocytes and deficient lymphocyte function. In contrast, <i>ex vivo<\/i> transduction with the APro-Artemis vector supported effective immune reconstitution to wild-type levels resulting in a fully functional T and B lymphocyte responses. These results demonstrate the importance of regulated Artemis expression in immune reconstitution of Artemis deficient SCID.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002a0c","authors":["Dr. Megan M Multhaup","MulthaupMegan M.","Multhaup MM","Podetz-Pedersen KM","Karlen AD","Olson ER","Gunther R","Somia NV","Blazar BR","Cowan MJ","McIvor RS"],"doi":"10.1089\/hum.2014.062","endpage":"243","first_seen_on":"2015-03-11T11:40:23+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid","nci","phs"],"issns":["1043-0342","1557-7422"],"issue":"4","journal":"Human Gene Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1426074010,"links":["http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/10.1089\/hum.2014.062"],"pmid":"25738323","pubdate":"2015-03-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Biotechnology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"232","subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Role of Transgene Regulation in &lt;i&gt;Ex Vivo&lt;\/i&gt; Lentiviral Correction of Artemis Deficiency.","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-transgene-regulation-ex-vivo-lentiviral-correction-artemis-deficiency"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6561414,"mean":6.0795715041865,"rank":5597431,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6561414,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171189,"mean":9.9782237423186,"rank":141529,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171189,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":419,"mean":8.4671674641148,"rank":379,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":419,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":10.603846153846,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
