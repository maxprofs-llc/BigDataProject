Today, protein assays are mostly performed either with non-specific detection methods or immunoassays. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a very specific analytical method potentially very well suited for clinical laboratories. Its unique advantage relies in the high specificity of the detection. Any protein sequence variant, the presence of a post-translational modification or degradation will differ in mass and structure, and these differences will appear in the mass spectrum of the protein. On the other hand, protein MS is a relatively young technique, demanding specialized personnel and expensive instrumentation. Many scientists and opinion leaders predict MS to replace immunoassays for routine protein analysis, but there are only few protein MS applications routinely used in clinical chemistry laboratories today. The present review consists of a didactical introduction summarizing the pros and cons of MS assays compared to immunoassays, the different instrumentations, and various MS protein assays that have been proposed and\/or are used in clinical laboratories. An important distinction is made between full length protein analysis (top-down method) and peptide analysis after enzymatic digestion of the proteins (bottom-up method) and its implication for the protein assay. The document ends with an outlook on what type of analyses could be used in the future, and for what type of applications MS has a clear advantage compared to immunoassays.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037b7","authors":["Alexander Scherl","Scherl A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ymeth.2015.02.015","first_seen_on":"2015-03-11T19:38:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1095-9130","1046-2023","10462023"],"journal":"Methods","last_mentioned_on":1457193620,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25752846","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1046202315000882"],"pmid":"25752846","pubdate":"2015-03-06T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Clinical protein mass spectrometry.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-protein-mass-spectrometry"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7351662,"mean":6.3871000458227,"rank":6356721,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7351662,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197843,"mean":9.1762654845788,"rank":164211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197843,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":774,"mean":2.4043234152652,"rank":629,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":774,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":2.21896,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
