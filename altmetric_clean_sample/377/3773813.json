In this study, the cDNA of FREP was identified from the kuruma shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus (MjFREP2). The full-length cDNA of MjFREP2 is 1138 bp with an open reading frame of 954 bp that encodes a 317-amino acid protein comprising a signal peptide and a fibrinogen-like domain. MjFREP2 could be detected in hemocytes, heart, hepatopancreas, gills, stomach, and intestines. MjFREP2 could also be upregulated in hemocytes after Vibrio anguillarum and Staphylococcus aureus challenge. Agglutination and binding assay results revealed that the recombinant MjFREP2 bound to bacteria and polysaccharides. Immunocytochemical analysis results showed that MjFREP2 proteins were mainly distributed in the cytoplasm of hemocytes from unchallenged shrimp and transported to the membrane or secreted out of the cell after V. anguillarum or S. aureus challenge. The secreted MjFREP2 bound to the bacteria presented in shrimp hemolymph. The overexpression of MjFREP2 could enhance bacterial clearance by inducing the phagocytosis of hemocytes. This ability was impaired by knockdown of MjFREP2 with RNA interference. The cumulative mortality of MjFREP2-silenced shrimp was significantly higher than that of the control shrimp. These results suggested that MjFREP2 has an important function in the antibacterial immunity of M. japonicus.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028d8","authors":["Sun JJ","Lan JF","Shi XZ","Yang MC","Yang HT","Zhao XF","Wang JX"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.fsi.2014.05.005","first_seen_on":"2015-03-11T01:48:30+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Fish & Shellfish Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1436849676,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24830772?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24830772","pubdate":"2014-05-17T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Fisheries Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"A fibrinogen-related protein (FREP) is involved in the antibacterial immunity of Marsupenaeus japonicus.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fibrinogenrelated-protein-frep-involved-antibacterial-immunity-marsupenaeus-japonicus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5352377,"mean":6.2635557475804,"rank":2656422,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2534974,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5352377,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":154884,"mean":10.349601789738,"rank":80135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":68129,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":154884,"percentile":43},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":849,"mean":0.91892216981132,"rank":134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":657,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":849,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":0.83929411764706,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Student  > Ph.
