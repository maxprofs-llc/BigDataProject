After distinguishing the main contemporary issues related to time perception, the article focuses on the main findings and explanations that are available in the literature on explicit judgments about temporal intervals. The review emphasizes studies that are concerned with the processing of intervals lasting a few milliseconds to several seconds and covers studies issuing from either a behavioral or a neuroscience approach. It also discusses the question of whether there is an internal clock (pacemaker counter or oscillator device) that is dedicated to temporal processing and reports the main hypotheses regarding the involvement of biological structures in time perception.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002350","authors":["Simon Grondin"],"doi":"10.3758\/app.72.3.561","first_seen_on":"2015-03-10T11:33:27+00:00","issns":["1943-393X"],"journal":"Attention, Perception & Psychophysics","last_mentioned_on":1425987195,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.3758\/APP.72.3.561#page-1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.3758%2FAPP.72.3.561.pdf","pmid":"20348562","publisher":"Springer-Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","psychology"],"title":"Timing and time perception: A review of recent behavioral and neuroscience findings and theoretical directions","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/timing-time-perception-review-recent-behavioral-neuroscience-findings-theoretical-directions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4855319,"mean":5.7871341955397,"rank":3437119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":792400,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4855319,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145806,"mean":10.172570323377,"rank":105920,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":24447,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145806,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":345,"mean":5.4664069767442,"rank":253,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":44,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":345,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":2.6625,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":18,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":21,"Researcher":58,"Student  > Ph.
