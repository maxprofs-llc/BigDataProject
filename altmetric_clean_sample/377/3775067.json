Kuang and co-workers, described on page 1706. By using a surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)-encoded sensing system, the limit of detection (LOD) is 0.96 aM, 85 aM, and 9.2 aM for PSA, thrombin, and mucin-1, respectively. This work opens up a new avenue for the diagnosis and prognosis of early-stage diseases and drug-discovery programs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006895","authors":["Liguang Xu","Wenjing Yan","Wei Ma","Hua Kuang","Xiaoling Wu","Liqaing Liu","Yuan Zhao","Libing Wang","Chuanlai Xu"],"doi":"10.1002\/adma.201570070","first_seen_on":"2015-03-11T10:31:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1521-4095"],"issue":"10","journal":"Advanced Materials","last_mentioned_on":1426069811,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25753242?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25753242","pubdate":"2015-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Engineering","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"title":"Biosensors: SERS Encoded Silver Pyramids for Attomolar Detection of Multiplexed Disease Biomarkers (Adv.
