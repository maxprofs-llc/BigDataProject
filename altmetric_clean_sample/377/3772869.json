Patients \u2a7e18 years who had received an alloHSCT_2 for lymphoma relapse between 2000 and 2011 were eligible. One hundred and forty patients were identified. The diagnosis was Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) in 31%, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in 14%, T-cell lymphoma in 12%, indolent lymphoma in 19%, mantle cell lymphoma in 16% and other lymphomas in 8% of the patients. The median interval from alloHSCT_1 to alloHSCT_2 was 19 (range 4-116) months. Disease status at alloHSCT_2 was chemosensitive in 46%, refractory in 43% and unknown in 11% of the patients. Three-year PFS, OS, relapse incidence and nonrelapse mortality were 19%, 29%, 58% and 23%, respectively. PFS and OS were significantly affected by refractory disease at alloHSCT_2 and a short interval between alloHSCT_1 and alloHSCT_2. Long-term PFS was observed across all lymphoma subsets except for aggressive B-cell lymphoma. In conclusion, alloHSCT_2 is feasible and can result in long-term disease control in patients with lymphoma recurrence after alloHSCT_1, in particular if relapse occurs late and is chemosensitive.Bone Marrow Transplantation advance online publication, 9 March 2015; doi:10.1038\/bmt.2015.12.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002414","authors":["K Horstmann","A Boumendil","J Finke","H Finel","E Kanfer","G Milone","N Russell","A Bacigalupo","Y Chalandon","J L Diez-Martin","N Ifrah","M Jurado Chacon","P Dreger"],"doi":"10.1038\/bmt.2015.12","first_seen_on":"2015-03-10T21:19:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0268-3369"," 1476-5365"],"journal":"Bone Marrow Transplantation","last_mentioned_on":1426861576,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/bmt\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/abs\/bmt201512a.html","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/25751644\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25751644","http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/bmt\/rss\/aop\/~3\/HtFrxuBvYKI\/bmt.2015.12"],"pmid":"25751644","pubdate":"2015-03-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Haematological cancer","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Second allo-SCT in patients with lymphoma relapse after a first allogeneic transplantation.
