Additionally, twelve known compounds and vanillin were isolated. Their structures were established on the basis of spectroscopic analysis, as well as by comparison with literature data. The anticancer activity of nine of these compounds was investigated.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003327","authors":["Wittayalai S","Mahidol C","Prachyawarakorn V","Prawat H","Ruchirawat S"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.phytochem.2013.12.017","first_seen_on":"2015-03-10T20:52:06+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Phytochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1426020696,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24472391?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24472391","pubdate":"2014-01-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry","botany"],"title":"Terpenoids from the roots of Drypetes hoaensis and their cytotoxic activities.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/terpenoids-roots-drypetes-hoaensis-cytotoxic-activities"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4855454,"mean":5.7883919127654,"rank":4062940,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4855454,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145815,"mean":10.178809757637,"rank":121379,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145815,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1290,"mean":2.6931993793638,"rank":1084,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1290,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":2.375,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
