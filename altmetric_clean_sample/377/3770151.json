Materials and Methods This single-center prospective study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Among 548 consecutive patients, 374 patients with ischemic stroke (254 men and 120 women, with a mean age of 63.1 years) who underwent TEE and cardiac CT were prospectively enrolled in this study. TEE and cardiac CT images were assessed for cardioembolic sources, including thrombus, tumor, spontaneous echo contrast, valvular vegetation, atrial septal aneurysm, patent foramen ovale, and aortic plaque. The primary end point was stroke recurrence. Prognostic factors were assessed with Cox univariate and multivariate analysis. The integrated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was calculated to compare the prognostic abilities of CT and TEE parameters. Results During a median follow-up period of 433 days, there were a total of 28 recurrent stroke events. The TEE parameter of plaque complexity (hazard ratio, 13.512; 95% confidence interval: 3.668, 49.778; P < .001) and CT parameter of plaque complexity (hazard ratio, 32.538; 95% confidence interval: 7.544, 140.347; P < .001) were predictors of recurrent stroke. The time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated no significant differences in prediction of recurrent stroke between TEE and CT parameters (integrated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.812 vs 0.840, respectively). Conclusion Complex aortic plaque evaluated with cardiac CT and TEE was associated with an increased risk of stroke recurrence in patients with ischemic stroke.
