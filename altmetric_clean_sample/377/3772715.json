Designing small molecule inhibitors targeting A\u03b2 oligomerization is one attractive and promising strategy for AD treatment. Here we used ion mobility spectrometry coupled to mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) to study the different effects of the molecular tweezers CLR01 and CLR03 on A\u03b2 self-assembly. CLR01 was found to bind to A\u03b2 directly and disrupt its early oligomerization. Moreover, CLR01 remodeled the early oligomerization of A\u03b242 by compacting the structures of dimers and tetramers and as a consequence eliminated higher-order oligomers. Unexpectedly, the negative-control derivative, CLR03, which lacks the hydrophobic arms of the tweezer structure, was found to facilitate early A\u03b2 oligomerization. Our study provides an example of IMS as a powerful tool to study and better understand the interaction between small molecule modulators and A\u03b2 oligomerization, which is not attainable by other methods, and provides important insights into therapeutic development of molecular tweezers for AD treatment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec5","authors":["Xueyun Zheng","De-Yu Liu","Frank-Gerrit Kl\u00e4rner","Thomas Schrader","Gal Bitan","Michael T Bowers"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jpcb.5b00692","first_seen_on":"2015-03-10T20:23:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-5207"],"journal":"Journal of Physical Chemistry B","last_mentioned_on":1451560627,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25751170?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25751170","pubdate":"2015-03-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Amyloid \u03b2-protein Assembly: The Effect of Molecular Tweezer CLR01 and CLR03.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/amyloid-%CE%B2protein-assembly-effect-molecular-tweezers-clr01-clr03"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6896042,"mean":6.1898417149761,"rank":5908298,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6896042,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195820,"mean":9.078900178226,"rank":161582,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195820,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3305,"mean":1.7260647699758,"rank":2136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3305,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117,"mean":1.0446034482759,"rank":61,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
