Physical activity was measured by self-report with the Yale Physical Activity Survey and objectively with the Sensewear Pro armband at enrollment and at the end of the 6-week program.\nThere was a significant increase in frequency of self-reported vigorous physical activity. We did not detect a statistically significant difference in objectively measured physical activity although increase in number of steps and sedentary activity were in the desired direction.\nThese results suggest participants' perception of physical activity intensity differs from the intensity objectively captured with a valid and reliable physical activity monitor.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc1a","authors":["Leutwyler, Heather","Hubbard, Erin","Cooper, Bruce","Dowling, Glenna"],"doi":"10.3389\/fpsyt.2015.00180","first_seen_on":"2015-12-21T06:53:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1664-0640"],"journal":"Frontiers in Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1452166087,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpsyt.2015.00180\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26733891?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpsyt.2015.00180\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4685058","pmid":"26733891","pubdate":"2015-12-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"The Impact of a Videogame-Based Pilot Physical Activity Program in Older Adults with Schizophrenia on Subjectively and Objectively Measured Physical Activity.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-videogamebased-pilot-physical-activity-program-older-adults-schizophrenia-subjectively-object"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6918109,"mean":6.2122534265127,"rank":3395632,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":2016567,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6918109,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":295924,"mean":8.832717078429,"rank":151007,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":112493,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":295924,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":889,"mean":7.7811261261261,"rank":633,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":185,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":889,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":4.79975,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
