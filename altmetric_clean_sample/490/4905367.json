However, there are no epidemiological studies with estimates for the general dog population.\nTo investigate the epidemiological characteristics of NOAI in a large population of insured dogs.\nData were derived from 525,028 client-owned dogs insured by a Swedish insurance company representing 2,364,652 dog-years at risk (DYAR) during the period between 1995-2006.\nRetrospective cohort study. Incidence rates, prevalences, and relative risks for dogs with NOAI (AI with no previous claim for hypercortisolism), were calculated for the whole dog population, and for subgroups divided by breed and sex. Mortality rates were calculated and compared in dogs with NOAI and the remaining dogs overall.\nIn total 534 dogs were identified with NOAI. The overall incidence was 2.3 cases per 10,000 DYAR. The relative risk of disease was significantly higher in the Portuguese Water Dog, Standard Poodle, Bearded Collie, Cairn Terrier, and Cocker Spaniel compared with other breeds combined. Female dogs overall were at higher risk of developing AI than male dogs (RR 1.85; 95% CI, 1.55-2.22; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). The relative risk of death was 1.9 times higher in dogs with NOAI than in dogs overall.\nThe data supports the existence of breed-specific differences in incidence rates of NOAI in dogs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52d3cf058f610004131","authors":["Hanson, J.M.","Tengvall, K.","Bonnett, B.N.","Hedhammar, \u00c5.","Hanson, J M","Tengvall, K","Bonnett, B N","Hedhammar, \u00c5"],"doi":"10.1111\/jvim.13815","endpage":"84","first_seen_on":"2015-12-21T17:26:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1939-1676"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1451586233,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jvim.13815\/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26683136","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/jvim.13815","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jvim.13815\/epdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jvim.13815\/pdf","pmid":"26683136","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"startpage":"76","subjects":["internalmedicine"],"title":"Naturally Occurring Adrenocortical Insufficiency - An Epidemiological Study Based on a Swedish-Insured Dog Population of 525,028 Dogs.","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/naturally-occurring-adrenocortical-insufficiency-epidemiological-study-based-swedishinsured-dog-popu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6896042,"mean":6.1898417149761,"rank":2421319,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4452533,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6896042,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":295381,"mean":8.8165833841152,"rank":90546,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":203264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":295381,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1050,"mean":2.4710657769304,"rank":182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":866,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1050,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":1.7987179487179,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
