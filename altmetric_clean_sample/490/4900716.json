Bifid epiglottis is also an extremely rare congenital anomaly that usually occurs in a syndromic picture in association with other anomalies such as polydactyly, cleft palate and micrognathia, which are seen in Pallister-Hall Syndrome and rarely with other syndromes. We report a case of bilateral saccular cysts and bifid epiglottis in a full term neonate presenting with stridor. The patient's other congenital anomalies included microretrognathia, short neck, polydactyly of four extremities and hypospadias. The patient underwent staged endoscopic microsurgical marsupialization of both cysts and endoscopic repair of the bifid epiglottis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5263cf058f610003d90","authors":["Rawan Arif","Talal Al-Khatib","Razan Daghistani","Maher Shalabi","Arif, Rawan","Al-Khatib, Talal","Daghistani, Razan","Shalabi, Maher"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12070-015-0960-2","first_seen_on":"2015-12-20T12:40:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0973-7707","2231-3796"],"issue":"1","journal":"Indian Journal of Otolaryngology & Head & Neck Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1460458147,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs12070-015-0960-2","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27066427?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs12070-015-0960-2.pdf","pmid":"27066427","pubdate":"2015-12-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer India","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Head and Neck Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Otorhinolaryngology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Congenital Bilateral Saccular Cysts and Bifid Epiglottis: Presentation and Management","type":"article","volume":"68","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/congenital-bilateral-saccular-cysts-bifid-epiglottis-presentation-management"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7540906,"mean":6.5135694142772,"rank":6531873,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7540906,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":302875,"mean":8.9787986885633,"rank":252486,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":302875,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187,"mean":2.1398709677419,"rank":144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":0.92307692307692,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OTO_docs\/statuses\/719839761452523522","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4900716],"posted_on":"2016-04-12T10:49:07+00:00","author":{"name":"OTOdocs","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/451475015045615617\/pvQ7oTD5_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Otolaryngology papers in #PubMed and #arXiv.","id_on_source":"OTO_docs","tweeter_id":"2424371810","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":387},"tweet_id":"719839761452523522"}]}}
