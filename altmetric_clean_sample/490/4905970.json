We have developed a strategy that facilitates the recovery of exons from random pieces of cloned genomic DNA. The basis of this \"exon trapping\" strategy is that, during a retroviral life cycle, genomic sequences of nonviral origin are correctly spliced and may be recovered as a cDNA copy of the introduced segment. By using this genetic assay for cis-acting sequences required for RNA splicing, we have screened approximately 20 kilobase pairs of cloned genomic DNA and have recovered all four predicted exons.","ads_id":"1990PNAS...87.8995D","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Duyk, G M","Kim, S W","Myers, R M","Cox, D R"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.87.22.8995","first_seen_on":"2015-12-21T22:02:32+00:00","issns":["0027-8424","1091-6490"],"issue":"22","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1451935714,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2247475","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.87.22.8995"],"pmcid":"PMC55087","pmid":"2247475","pubdate":"1990-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Exon trapping: a genetic screen to identify candidate transcribed sequences in cloned mammalian genomic DNA.","type":"article","volume":"87","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exon-trapping-genetic-screen-identify-candidate-transcribed-sequences-cloned-mammalian-genomic-dna"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8456795,"mean":7.1058899613651,"rank":2175849,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5128465,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8456795,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":315179,"mean":9.137570103243,"rank":91676,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":217093,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":315179,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46912,"mean":24.586052610262,"rank":22608,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":15346,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46912,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":878,"mean":53.240754846066,"rank":571,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":301,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":878,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
