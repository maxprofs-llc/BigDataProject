Several issues have been raised in the hundred years since its discovery and in this article we discuss features of this fascinating fungal pathogen including its biology, eco-epidemiology and aspects of its pathogenicity. We also consider some of its virulence determinants, the most recent advances in the study of its metabolic pathways and the molecular and genetic research tools developed for this research. We also review the animal models used to study host-fungal interactions and how the host defense mechanisms against this pathogen work.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d3c","authors":["Gonzalez, Angel","Hernandez, Orville"],"doi":"10.1002\/yea.3147","endpage":"128","first_seen_on":"2015-12-20T14:12:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1097-0061"],"issue":"4","journal":"Yeast","last_mentioned_on":1456520591,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26683539?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/yea.3147#.VtC9flYCQZE.twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/yea.3147\/pdf","pmid":"26683539","pubdate":"2015-12-20T22:00:46+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Industrial Biotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"113","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"New insights into a complex fungal pathogen: The case of Paracoccidioides spp.","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-insights-complex-fungal-pathogen-case-paracoccidioides-spp"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7289383,"mean":6.3680766857843,"rank":3715313,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2055095,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7289383,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":299244,"mean":8.9493333979406,"rank":154151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":111745,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":299244,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":264,"mean":2.2145171102662,"rank":134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":101,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":264,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":2.8653571428571,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Master":4,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Immunology and Microbiology":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1,"CI":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/yeast_papers\/statuses\/678578662472462336","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4900910],"posted_on":"2015-12-20T14:12:15+00:00","author":{"name":"yeast_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yeast","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/470859351591092225\/S4XxHSFa_normal.jpeg","description":"Get your fresh daily #yeast #papers from #Pubmed, #Arxiv, #BioRxiv and #PeerJ here!
