However, it is not known how or in which cells these effectors function to promote survival. Here, we showed that after infection with ECTV, the\u00a0TLR9-MyD88-IRF7 pathway was necessary in CD11c(+) cells for the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes (iMos) to the draining lymph node (dLN). In the dLN, the major producers of IFN-I were infected iMos, which used the DNA sensor-adaptor STING to activate IRF7 and nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling to induce the expression of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2, respectively. Thus, in\u00a0vivo, two pathways of DNA pathogen sensing act sequentially in two distinct cell types to orchestrate resistance to a viral disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a95","authors":["Xu, Ren-Huan","Wong, Eric B","Rubio, Daniel","Roscoe, Felicia","Ma, Xueying","Nair, Savita","Remakus, Sanda","Schwendener, Reto","John, Shinu","Shlomchik, Mark","Sigal, Luis J"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.immuni.2015.11.015","endpage":"1159","first_seen_on":"2015-12-20T21:05:41+00:00","funders":["niaid","nci","niehs"],"issns":["1097-4180","1074-7613","10747613"],"issue":"6","journal":"Immunity","last_mentioned_on":1462681267,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26682986?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.cell.com\/immunity\/abstract\/S1074-7613%2815%2900493-8?platform=hootsuite"],"pmcid":"PMC4684903","pmid":"26682986","pubdate":"2015-12-20T22:00:57+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"1148","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Sequential Activation of Two Pathogen-Sensing Pathways Required for Type I Interferon Expression and Resistance to an Acute DNA Virus Infection","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sequential-activation-two-pathogensensing-pathways-required-type-i-interferon-expression-resistance"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7667486,"mean":6.5863981409766,"rank":3405111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4186047,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7667486,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":304872,"mean":8.9835013694314,"rank":122560,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":176881,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":304872,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2104,"mean":12.024496433666,"rank":1338,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":738,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2104,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65,"mean":19.11965625,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
