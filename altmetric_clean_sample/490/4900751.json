It is one of the leading causes of irreversible loss of vision worldwide. The most important trigger of glaucomatous damage is elevated eye pressure, and the current standard approach in glaucoma therapy is reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP). However, despite the use of effective medications or surgical treatment leading to lowering of IOP, progression of glaucomatous changes and loss of vision among patients with glaucoma is common. Therefore, it is critical to prevent vision loss through additional treatment. To implement such treatment(s), it is imperative to identify pathophysiological changes in glaucoma and develop therapeutic methods taking into account neuroprotection. Currently, there is no method of neuroprotection with long-term proven effectiveness in the treatment of glaucoma. Among the most promising molecules shown to protect the retina and optic nerve are neurotrophic factors. Thus, the current focus is on the development of safe and non-invasive methods for the long-term elevation of the intraocular level of neurotrophins through advanced gene therapy and topical eye treatment and on the search for selective agonists of neurotrophin receptors affording more efficient neuroprotection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003475","authors":["W\u00f3jcik-Gryciuk, Anna","Skup, Ma\u0142gorzata","Waleszczyk, Wioletta J","Waleszczyk, Wioletta J."],"doi":"10.3233\/rnn-150599","endpage":"123","first_seen_on":"2015-12-20T12:58:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1878-3627","0922-6028","18783627"],"issue":"1","journal":"Restorative Neurology & Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1471010042,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26684267?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26684267?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3233\/rnn-150599"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/content.iospress.com\/download\/restorative-neurology-and-neuroscience\/rnn150599?id=restorative-neurology-and-neuroscience%2Frnn150599","pmid":"26684267","pubdate":"2015-12-20T22:00:30+00:00","publisher":"IOS Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"107","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Glaucoma -state of the art and perspectives on treatment.","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/glaucoma-state-art-perspectives-treatment-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8204367,"mean":6.945700472644,"rank":1936128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6231355,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8204367,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":310796,"mean":9.1260065895523,"rank":83255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":226359,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":310796,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":221,"mean":6.1363272727273,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":171,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":221,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.4,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MltplSclppr\/statuses\/678560015272173568","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4900751],"posted_on":"2015-12-20T12:58:09+00:00","author":{"name":"MS Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/599614030790008833\/7IuEjHC7_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"MltplSclppr","tweeter_id":"3262004991","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":212},"tweet_id":"678560015272173568"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/678612174802051072","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4900751],"posted_on":"2015-12-20T16:25:25+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":981},"tweet_id":"678612174802051072"}],"wikipedia":[{"title":"Flammer syndrome","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=734152145#altmetric_citation_77323fc4-6cb1-4abd-a05a-4f08f3b470b2","license":"public","citation_ids":[4900751],"posted_on":"2016-08-12T13:54:02+00:00","summary":"Flammer syndrome is a recently described clinical entity comprising a complex of clinical features caused mainly by dysregulation of the blood supply which has previously been called vascular dysregulation.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=44350580","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Rjwilmsi","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Rjwilmsi"}}]}}
