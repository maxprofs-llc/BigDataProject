Of them, 88 with AF were divided into cardioembolic stroke (CES) (n=57) and non-CES (n=31) groups, and 95 age- and sex-matched patients with non-CES without AF served as controls. Clinical factors, echocardiographic findings and MDCT parameters were evaluated.\nBrain infarct volume, LAA orifice diameter, and LAA volume were larger in patients with CES with AF than in those with non-CES with AF (p<0.05 in all cases), but no difference was observed between patients with non-CES with AF and those with non-CES without AF. MDCT and echocardiographic parameters of left atrial dysfunction were different depending on the presence of AF but not between patients with CES with AF vs. non-CES with AF. After adjusting for covariates, LAA orifice diameter (odds ratio[OR], 1.19; 95% confidence interval[CI], 1.06-1.33; p=0.004) and LAA volume (OR, 12.20; 95% CI, 2.58-57.79; p=0.002) were independently associated with CES with AF, as was infarct volume.\nIn patients with AF, LAA orifice diameter and LAA volume, but not left atrial dysfunction, were determinants of CES and were useful for stratifying non-cardioembolic risk in patients with AF.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61a3cf058f610007602","authors":["Kyo Jeong, Woo","Choi, Jin-Ho","Pyo Son, Jeong","Lee, Suyeon","Ji Lee, Mi","Hyeon Choe, Yeon","Young Bang, Oh"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.hrthm.2015.12.026","first_seen_on":"2015-12-21T17:21:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1547-5271","1556-3871"],"journal":"Heart Rhythm","last_mentioned_on":1450744501,"links":["http:\/\/www.heartrhythmjournal.com\/article\/S1547-5271(15)01552-0\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.heartrhythmjournal.com\/article\/S1547527115015520\/pdf","pmid":"26707792","pubdate":"2015-12-29T22:01:05+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Volume and Morphology of Left Atrial Appendage as Determinants of Stroke Subtype in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/volume-morphology-left-atrial-appendage-determinants-stroke-subtype-patients-atrial-fibrillation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.45,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6809781,"mean":6.1874639453807,"rank":2461506,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4341314,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6809781,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":294523,"mean":8.8049010532317,"rank":97074,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":196969,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":294523,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":743,"mean":4.8389892183288,"rank":273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":470,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":743,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":5.9301724137931,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
