The lowest effective concentration to inhibit growth (EC90) against drug-susceptible and -resistant parasites, time-kill kinetics, reversibility of inhibition and propensity for P-glycoprotein-mediated exclusion from the blood-brain barrier were determined.\nNitrofuran isoxazolines were potent inhibitors of T. brucei brucei proliferation at nanomolar concentrations, with pentacyclic nitrofurans being 100-fold more potent than nifurtimox. Activity was sustained against nifurtimox-resistant parasites, suggesting the possibility of a unique mechanism of activation and potential for use in the treatment of drug-resistant infections. Exposure of parasites to the maximum concentrations of Compound 15 achieved in vivo with oral dosing yielded >2 logs of irreversible killing in <4 h, indicating rapid trypanocidal activity.\nPentacyclic nitrofuran isoxazolines warrant further development for the treatment of drug-susceptible and nifurtimox-resistant trypanosome infections.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c89","authors":["Bruhn, David F","Wyllie, Susan","Rodr\u00edguez-Cort\u00e9s, Adaris","Carrillo, Angela K","Rakesh, ","Guy, Kiplin","Fairlam, Alan H","Lee, Richard E"],"doi":"10.1093\/jac\/dkv417","first_seen_on":"2015-12-20T20:40:53+00:00","funders":["niehs","wellcome","niaid"],"issns":["1460-2091"],"journal":"Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (JAC)","last_mentioned_on":1450643554,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26682963?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26682963","pubdate":"2015-12-20T22:00:58+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["drugtherapy"],"title":"Pentacyclic nitrofurans that rapidly kill nifurtimox-resistant trypanosomes.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pentacyclic-nitrofurans-rapidly-kill-nifurtimoxresistant-trypanosomes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6797067,"mean":6.1791144149531,"rank":5813071,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6797067,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":293351,"mean":8.7942739730695,"rank":237660,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":293351,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2754,"mean":4.8272669814748,"rank":2410,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2754,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115,"mean":4.2333859649123,"rank":95,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
