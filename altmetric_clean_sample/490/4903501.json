The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Papanicolaou (Pap) smears in detecting endometrial cancers.\nThere were 146 cases of endometrial cancer diagnosed at our institute in 2000-2002 and 271 in 2010-2012. Among them, 57 and 95 relevant reports of Pap smears 6 months prior to the histology diagnosis were retrieved for this study, respectively. In the first time period, new criteria for detecting endometrial lesions had not yet been incorporated into routine screening.\nTwenty cases (21%) of adenocarcinoma, 12 (13%) of atypical glandular cells, 4 (4%) of endometrial debris and 59 (62%) negative reports were found among the more recent 95 relevant Pap smears. The overall efficacy of the Pap smear for detecting endometrial malignancy was 38%, higher than 10 years previously (30%).\nAlthough the Pap smear was originally designed to screen cervical lesions, more effective detection of endometrial lesions could be achieved by adding new criteria to the routine screening.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006838","authors":["Lai, Chiung-Ru","Hsu, Chih-Yi","Hang, Jen-Fan","Li, Anna Fen-Yau"],"doi":"10.1159\/000438975","first_seen_on":"2015-12-21T06:41:52+00:00","issns":["0001-5547"],"journal":"Acta Cytologica","last_mentioned_on":1448226916,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1159\/000438975","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26315394"],"pmid":"26315394","pubdate":"2015-08-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"The Diagnostic Value of Routine Papanicolaou Smears for Detecting Endometrial Cancers: An Update.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diagnostic-value-routine-papanicolaou-smears-detecting-endometrial-cancers-update"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6593220,"mean":6.1186456839977,"rank":5625027,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6593220,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":265502,"mean":9.3446432442815,"rank":210817,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":265502,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120,"mean":1.3306890756303,"rank":77,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":2.1,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"The Diagnostic Value of Routine Papanicolaou Smears for Detecting Endometrial Cancers: An...","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=921945367853039&id=535607813153465","license":"public","citation_ids":[4903501],"posted_on":"2015-11-22T21:15:16+00:00","summary":"Acta Cytol. 2015 Oct;59(4):315-8. doi: 10.1159\/000438975.
