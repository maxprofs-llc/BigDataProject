In complex , two TeMo6 polyoxoanions bridge Zn(II) ions to generate a discrete tetranuclear zinc complex H2[Zn4(3-Hdpyp)2(TeMo6O24)2(H2O)16]. In , the TeMo6 anions connect the metal-organic units [Zn3(3-dpyb)2](6+) to form an Anderson-type TeMo6-based wave-like metal-organic chain. Both the discrete tetranuclear subunits in and 1D wavy chains in were further extended to 2D supramolecular networks through the hydrogen bonding interactions. In complex , the TeMo6 anions link the metal-organic units [Cu2(4-Hdpyp)2](6+) to construct a 2D layer, which is further extended to a 3D supramolecular framework by the hydrogen bonding interactions. In complex , the TeMo6 polyoxoanions bridge the Cu(II) ions to generate a 2D Cu-TeMo6 inorganic layer, which is further linked by the \u03bc2-bridging 3-dpyp ligands to form a 3D metal-organic framework. The effects of various coordination modes of TeMo6 polyanions and the bis-pyridyl-bis-amide ligands, as well as the central metals on the structures of the title complexes have been discussed. Besides, the fluorescence, electrochemical properties and photocatalytic activities of the title complexes have been investigated in detail.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Xiuli Wang","Junjun Sun","Hongyan Lin","Zhihan Chang","Aixiang Tian","Guocheng Liu","Xiang Wang"],"doi":"10.1039\/c5dt04074d","endpage":"2719","first_seen_on":"2015-12-21T12:25:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1477-9234"],"issue":"6","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1452273663,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2015\/DT\/C5DT04074D?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=inorganicnews","http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2016\/DT\/C5DT04074D?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=inorganicnews"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2015\/dt\/c5dt04074d","pmid":"26745725","pubdate":"2015-12-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"2709","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Novel Anderson-type [TeMo6O24]6\u2212-based metal\u2013organic complexes tuned by different species and their coordination modes: assembly, various architectures and properties","type":"article","volume":"45","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-andersontype-temo6o246based-metalorganic-complexes-tuned-different-species-coordination-modes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6920439,"mean":6.2148136513881,"rank":5931788,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6920439,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":296059,"mean":8.8321857203654,"rank":241098,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":296059,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10216,"mean":0.65262437591777,"rank":2845,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10216,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":562,"mean":0.76149732620321,"rank":213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":562,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
