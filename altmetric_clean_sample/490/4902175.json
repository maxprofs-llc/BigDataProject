Insulin resistance and derangement of lipid metabolism, accompanied by activation of the pro-inflammatory response and fibrogenesis, are essential pathways in the development of the more clinically significant form of NAFLD, known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Recent advances in the functional characterization of bile acid receptors, such as farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor (TGR) 5, have provided further insight in the pathophysiology of NASH and have led to the development of potential therapeutic targets for NAFLD and NASH. Beyond maintaining bile acid metabolism, FXR and TGR5 also regulate lipid metabolism, maintain glucose homeostasis, increase energy expenditure, and ameliorate hepatic inflammation. These intriguing features have been exploited to develop bile acid analogues to target pathways in NAFLD and NASH pathogenesis. This review provides a brief overview of the pathogenesis of NAFLD and NASH, and then delves into the biological functions of bile acid receptors, particularly with respect to NASH pathogenesis, with a description of the associated experimental data, and, finally, we discuss the prospects of bile acid analogues in the treatment of NAFLD and NASH.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc95","authors":["Yuan, Liyun","Bambha, Kiran"],"doi":"10.4254\/wjh.v7.i28.2811","first_seen_on":"2015-12-20T22:46:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1948-5182"],"issue":"28","journal":"World Journal of Hepatology","last_mentioned_on":1450677960,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26668692?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC4670952","pmid":"26668692","pubdate":"2015-12-08T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Bile acid receptors and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bile-acid-receptors-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6803403,"mean":6.1842532809271,"rank":2875253,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":3773019,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6803403,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":293584,"mean":8.7929935180166,"rank":122512,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":161453,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":293584,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234,"mean":3.1748841201717,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":173,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":1.2410714285714,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
