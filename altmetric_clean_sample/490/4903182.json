We exploited historically collected herbarium specimens to investigate potential physiological responses of trees in three subtropical forests representing an urban-to-rural gradient, across which N deposition has probably varied over the past six decades. We measured foliar [N] and [P] and stable carbon (\u03b4(13) C), oxygen (\u03b4(18) O) and nitrogen (\u03b4(15) N) isotopic compositions in tissue from herbarium specimens of plant species collected from 1947 to 2014. Foliar [N] and N\u00a0:\u00a0P increased, and \u03b4(15) N and [P] decreased in the two forests close to urban centers. Consistent with recent studies demonstrating that N deposition in the region is (15) N-depleted, these data suggest that the increased foliar [N] and N\u00a0:\u00a0P, and decreased [P], may be attributable to atmospheric deposition and associated enhancement of P limitation. Estimates of intrinsic water use efficiency calculated from foliar \u03b4(13) C decreased by c. 30% from the 1950s to 2014, contrasting with multiple studies investigating similar parameters in N-limited forests. This effect may reflect decreased photosynthesis, as suggested by a conceptual model of foliar \u03b4(13) C and \u03b4(18) O. Long-term N deposition may exacerbate P limitation and mitigate projected increases in carbon stocks driven by elevated CO2 in forests on P-limited soils.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50e3cf058f6100031cc","authors":["Huang, Zhiqun","Liu, Bao","Davis, Murray","Sardans, Jordi","Pe\u00f1uelas, Josep","Billings, Sharon","Zhiqun Huang","Bao Liu","Murray Davis","Jordi Sardans","Josep Pe\u00f1uelas","Sharon Billings"],"doi":"10.1111\/nph.13785","endpage":"442","first_seen_on":"2015-12-21T02:35:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1469-8137","0028646X"],"issue":"2","journal":"New Phytologist","last_mentioned_on":1502432616,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/wol1\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/nph.13785#.VnF78M7Szfc.hootsuite","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/wol1\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/nph.13785#.VnqwWfjxzy4.hootsuite","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/wol1\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111%2Fnph.13785#.VnF78M7Szfc.hootsuite"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/nph.13785\/pdf","pmid":"26661404","pubdate":"2015-12-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"431","subjects":["botany"],"title":"Long\u2010term nitrogen deposition linked to reduced water use efficiency in forests with low phosphorus availability","type":"article","volume":"210","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/longterm-nitrogen-deposition-linked-reduced-water-efficiency-forests-low-phosphorus-availability-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.3,"score_history":{"1y":0.85,"6m":0.85,"3m":0.85,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8355069,"mean":7.046560105308,"rank":1351949,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":6999877,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8355069,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":314360,"mean":9.11953058764,"rank":61659,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":252495,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":314360,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3646,"mean":8.1078611796982,"rank":1149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":2490,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3646,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132,"mean":8.9560305343511,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":69,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
