However, long-term oncologic outcomes have not been reported to date.\nTo report long-term oncologic outcomes of RPN.\nConsecutive patients undergoing RPN from June 2006 to March 2010 were selected from our prospective RPN database. Patients with benign tumors, prior ipsilateral PN, or prior radical nephrectomy and those with follow-up of <1 mo were excluded.\nTransperitoneal RPN.\nDemographic, perioperative, and postoperative data were analyzed. Overall survival (OS), cancer-free survival (CFS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Univariate logistic regression analysis for overall mortality was performed to evaluate the odds ratio (OR) for variables of interest.\nIn total, 115 RPNs for RCC were performed in 110 patients. The mean age was 59.8\u00b111.0 yr and the median age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index (ACCI) was 4 (interquartile range [IQR] 3-5). The median tumor size was 2.6cm (IQR 2.0-3.7) and median RENAL score was 7 (IQR 6-9). Clear cell carcinoma was present in 67.8% of cases, and two cases (1.7%) had positive surgical margins. Glomerular filtration rate preservation was 87.8% (IQR 74.9-98.1), which translates to 19.1% chronic kidney disease upstaging. The median follow-up was 61.9 mo (IQR 50.9-71.4) and the 5-yr OS, CFS, and CSS were 91.1%, 97.8%, and 97.8%, respectively. On univariable logistic regression, ACCI was the only factor associated with a higher risk of overall mortality (OR 1.67, p=0.006). The retrospective design, the high surgical volume at our institution, and the potential selection bias with careful patient selection early in the RPN experience may limit the generalizability of our findings.\nThis is the first study confirming excellent long-term oncologic outcomes after RPN in a selected cohort of patients.\nRobotic partial nephrectomy is a relatively recently developed treatment for renal cell carcinoma. This study confirms its safety and reports excellent long-term cancer control.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002875","authors":["Hiury S. Andrade","Homayoun Zargar","Peter A.
