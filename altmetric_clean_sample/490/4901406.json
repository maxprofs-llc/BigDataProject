Such studies concerning children and youths, which would also take into account the specificity of the developmental age, are still too few. The ability to identify risk factors for children and youths with mood disorders, as well as the possibility to monitor them, is an essential element in preventing suicidal behaviours. Previous studies have clearly indicated that in the group of patients with an early onset of the bipolar disorder the occurrence of suicidal thoughts and intentions were significantly increased. Identifying the risk of suicide is hindered further by the complexity of the phenomenon, which is a compound interaction of various factors: biological, environmental, sociological, psychological and clinical. This is especially true with young adults suffering from mental illness and presenting a number of other psychopathological symptoms. The following paper introduces and reviews the results of current studies, which analysed the risk factors for suicide among children and youths with bipolar spectrum or already diagnosed with bipolar disorder. For this purpose we conducted the overview of recent years literature available in PubMed\/MEDLINE database, including the following search criteria: early onset bipolar disorder, bipolar disorder in children and young people, the spectrum of bipolar disorder, and suicidal ideation, suicidal intent, suicide.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fd3cf058f610006043","authors":["Rajewska-Rager, Aleksandra","Sibilski, Piotr","Lepczy\u0144ska, Natalia"],"doi":"10.12740\/pp\/29415","first_seen_on":"2015-12-20T17:19:46+00:00","issns":["0033-2674"],"issue":"3","journal":"Psychiatria Polska","last_mentioned_on":1450631971,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26276916?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26276916","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Risk factors for suicide among children and youths with bipolar spectrum and early bipolar disorder.","type":"article","volume":"49","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/czynniki-ryzyka-samobjstw-u-dzieci-i-modziey-ze-spektrum-choroby-i-chorob-afektywn-dwubiegunow-o-wcz"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6797067,"mean":6.1791144149531,"rank":5049219,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":984035,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6797067,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":293352,"mean":8.7942412672872,"rank":199083,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":55692,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":293352,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163,"mean":2.7428395061728,"rank":113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.5921052631579,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Psychology":1,"Business, Management and Accounting":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Bipolar_Blogs\/statuses\/678625790112567297","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4901406],"posted_on":"2015-12-20T17:19:31+00:00","author":{"name":"Bipolar Blogs","url":"http:\/\/www.pathsoflight.us\/bipolarwinds","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3605210516\/e9da8d6cabf3994c6ec4ab42483804b9_normal.png","description":"Blogs & news from the minds of people living with bipolar and researchers.
