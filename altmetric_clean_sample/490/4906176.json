EEN did not significantly affect the mortality rate (RR=0.75, 95%CI=[0.41, 1.39], P=0.37>0.05), the rate of sepsis (RR=0.70, 95%CI=[0.45, 1.09], P=0.12>0.05), or the wound infection rate (RR=0.61, 95%CI=[0.27, 1.37], P=0.23>0.05). In addition, three trails examined length of stay and found that EEN significantly increased the length of ventilator days (RR=0.42, 95%CI=[0.02, 0.81], P=0.04<0.05); however, EEN was not significantly associated with a decrease in the duration of antibiotic therapy (RR=-0.04, 95%CI=[-0.43, 0.36], P=0.85). Outcome data that could not be pooled for analyses were described in detail.\nThis study indicated that EEN does not have a profound effect on the prognosis of people with severe thermal injury and further studies are needed to verify its safety. Only the analysis considering the number of ventilator days suggested that EEN had negative effects (i.e., prolonged the ventilation period).This study also highlighted the need for high-level randomized controlled trails comparing EEN and LEN.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000247d","authors":["Guo, Yi-Nan","Li, Hui","Zhang, Pi-Hong"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.burns.2015.10.008","first_seen_on":"2015-12-21T23:21:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["03054179","1879-1409"],"journal":"Burns (03054179)","last_mentioned_on":1451386837,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0305417915003174","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26708272?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26708272","pubdate":"2015-12-29T11:01:59+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Early enteral nutrition versus late enteral nutrition for burns patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/early-enteral-nutrition-versus-late-enteral-nutrition-burns-patients-systematic-review-metaanalysis-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6889784,"mean":6.1841211059894,"rank":4890047,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1753491,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6889784,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":295182,"mean":8.8140854933073,"rank":182884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":94437,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":295182,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":639,"mean":5.3187805642633,"rank":408,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":639,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":1.3042553191489,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"MY":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DrDaleNeedham\/statuses\/679079325069672454","license":"gnip","rt":["ktconsultsglbl"],"citation_ids":[4906176],"posted_on":"2015-12-21T23:21:42+00:00","author":{"name":"Dale  Needham","url":"http:\/\/www.hopkinsmedicine.org\/OACIS","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/905840269010100224\/YHOxj7vh_normal.jpg","description":"#ICURehab - Johns Hopkins University - Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine, and Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation.
