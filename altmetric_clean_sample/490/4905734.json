In this study, the effect of ex vivo treatment with G-CSF on AML primary blasts was studied.\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells from AML patients were treated with G-CSF at increasing doses, alone or in co-culture with HS-5 stromal cells. Cell viability and surface phenotype was determined by flow cytometry 72\u00a0h after treatment. For clonogenicity assays, AML primary samples were treated for 18\u00a0h with G-CSF at increasing concentrations and cultured in methyl-cellulose for 14\u00a0days. Colonies were counted based on cellularity and morphology criteria.\nThe presence of G-CSF reduced the overall viability of AML cells co-cultured with bone marrow stroma; whereas, in absence of stroma, a negligible effect was observed. Moreover, clonogenic capacity of AML cells was significantly reduced upon treatment with G-CSF. Interestingly, reduction in the AML clonogenic capacity correlated with the sensitivity to chemotherapy observed in vivo.\nThese ex vivo results would provide a biological basis to data available from studies showing a clinical benefit with the use of G-CSF as a priming agent in patients with a chemosensitive AML and would support implementation of further studies exploring new strategies of chemotherapy priming in AML.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007ec","authors":["Meritxell Nomdedeu","Meritxell Nomdedeu","Mar\u00eda Carmen Lara-Castillo","Amaia Etxabe","Josep Mar\u00eda Cornet-Masana","Marta Pratcorona","Marina D\u00edaz-Bey\u00e1","Xavier Calvo","Mar\u00eda Rozman","Dolors Costa","Jordi Esteve","Ruth M.
