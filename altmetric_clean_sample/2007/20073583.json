All included subjects were randomly treated with helmet CPAP or HFNC in a 1:1 fashion until their clinical picture, oxygen saturation, and arterial blood gas (ABG) parameters resolved. The efficiencies of helmet CPAP and HFNC were evaluated by breathing frequency, SpO2 , ABG pH, ABG PaCO2 , ABG PaO2 , and PaO2 \/FIO2 , recorded once at baseline and then after 1 and 6 h of treatment. Both noninvasive respiratory support modalities were compared with a control group of subjects with respiratory distress under standard therapeutic pharmaceutical protocols.\nWe found that both helmet CPAP and HFNC were efficient in improving the clinical conditions of subjects with mildto-moderate respiratory distress, although clinical response to helmet CPAP was more efficient and rapid compared with HFNC. Children who received respiratory support had a better clinical course in terms of hospitalization, days of intravenous rehydration therapy, and days of drug administration compared with the control group (P < .001).\nBased on our knowledge, the present study is the first research comparing the effects of CPAP and HFNC in respiratory distress resolution in a pediatric intermediate care setting. It aims to identify the most efficient treatment to avoid pediatric ICU admissions and endotracheal intubation and reduce the administration of drugs and days of hospitalization.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005ca2","authors":["Giovanna Vitaliti","Maria Concetta Vitaliti","Maria Carla Finocchiaro","Vita Antonella Di Stefano","Piero Pavone","Nassim Matin","Nazgol Motamed-Gorji","Riccardo Lubrano","Raffaele Falsaperla"],"doi":"10.4187\/respcare.05384","first_seen_on":"2017-05-12T14:07:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0020-1324","1943-3654"],"journal":"Respiratory Care","last_mentioned_on":1494719754,"links":["http:\/\/rc.rcjournal.com\/content\/early\/2017\/05\/09\/respcare.05384","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28487415?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/rc.rcjournal.com\/content\/early\/2017\/05\/09\/respcare.05384?papetoc"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/rc.rcjournal.com\/content\/respcare\/early\/2017\/05\/09\/respcare.05384.full.pdf","pmid":"28487415","pubdate":"2017-05-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Respiratory Care","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Randomized Comparison of Helmet CPAP Versus High-Flow Nasal Cannula Oxygen in Pediatric Respiratory Distress","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/randomized-comparison-helmet-cpap-versus-highflow-nasal-cannula-oxygen-pediatric-respiratory-distres"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":2.35,"6m":2.35,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8200733,"mean":6.9347145888862,"rank":3396412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4759949,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8200733,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238427,"mean":12.370799375907,"rank":90224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":146163,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238427,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":822,"mean":4.1631400730816,"rank":349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":466,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":822,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":20.93,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
