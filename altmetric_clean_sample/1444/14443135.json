This has opened perspectives for the use of MMPs' overexpression to improve the efficiency of cell therapy in muscular dystrophies and resolve fibrosis. Alternatively, inhibition of individual MMPs in animal models of muscular dystrophies has provided evidence of beneficial, dual or adverse effects on muscle morphology or function. We review here the role played by MMPs\/TIMPs in skeletal muscle inflammation and fibrosis, two major hurdles that limit the success of cell and gene therapy. We report and analyze the consequences of genetic or pharmacological modulation of MMP levels on the inflammation of skeletal muscles and their repair in light of experimental findings. We further discuss how the interplay between MMPs\/TIMPs levels, cytokines\/chemokines, growth factors and permanent low-grade inflammation favor cellular and molecular modifications resulting in fibrosis.","authors":["Alameddine, Hala S","Morgan, Jennifer E"],"doi":"10.3233\/jnd-160183","endpage":"473","first_seen_on":"2016-12-04T15:35:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2214-3599","22143599","22143602"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of neuromuscular diseases","last_mentioned_on":1481049594,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27911334"],"pmid":"27911334","pubdate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"455","title":"Matrix Metalloproteinases and Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases in\u00a0Inflammation and Fibrosis of Skeletal Muscles","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/matrix-metalloproteinases-tissue-inhibitor-metalloproteinases-ininflammation-fibrosis-skeletal-muscl"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":2.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
