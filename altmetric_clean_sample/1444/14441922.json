From the beginning of global reporting, insufficiency of data has been a challenge for monitoring the epidemic response\u00a0among key populations. However, key populations were only indirectly referenced in the 2001 Declaration of Commitment. By the 2006 Political Declaration on HIV\/AIDS, data from key populations were still not required from every country, and were sparsely reported compared to other indicators. The 2011 Political Declaration on HIV\/AIDS referenced key populations by name for the first time. In 2006, fewer than twenty countries (10%) reported HIV prevalence among key populations, whereas in 2012 the number of countries surpassed sixty (30%).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f6100056e0","authors":["Julia Gall","Keith Sabin","Luisa Frescura","Miriam Lewis Sabin","Taavi Erkkola","Igor Toskin"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10461-016-1618-0","first_seen_on":"2016-12-04T13:34:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-3254"],"journal":"AIDS & Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1480858451,"links":["http:\/\/www.readcube.com\/articles\/10.1007\/s10461-016-1618-0?author_access_token=ncS3qlKGYSr3Qne70Oqq7_e4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY5OI06cbjQX6C29hdgh4gS4SOy1tdBgKCBFJHjjZrEKGK02jdmZP_3oXg162fwq4OZL9EfZOzn0PAIxtzXkyfBRCD5qpMbHYOgsOK22prFsVA%3D%3D"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10461-016-1618-0.pdf","pmid":"27896550","pubdate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Health Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome","behavioralsciences"],"title":"Global Trends of Monitoring and Data Collection on the HIV Response among Key Populations Since the 2001 UN Declaration of Commitment on HIV\/AIDS","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/global-trends-monitoring-data-collection-hiv-response-among-key-populations-since-2001-un-declaratio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7847043,"mean":6.6493042501824,"rank":4110412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2186337,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7847043,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251148,"mean":12.269873508343,"rank":138280,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":89128,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251148,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1732,"mean":4.2742530329289,"rank":1217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1732,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":4.376875,"rank":61,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
