We used a modified constant depth film fermentor (CDFF) with pooled saliva as the inoculum and bovine dentin as a substratum. The test compounds were low molecular weight fraction (MLMW) of the shiitake extract and subfractions 4 and 5 (SF4 and SF5) of this fraction. Chlorhexidine (CHX) and water served as a positive and a negative control, respectively. Dentin mineral loss was quantified (TMR), microbial shifts within the microcosms were determined (qPCR), and the acidogenicity of the microcosms was assessed (CIA). From the compounds tested, the SF4 of shiitake showed strong inhibiting effect on dentin demineralization and induced microbial shifts that could be associated with oral health. The acid producing potential was increased, suggesting uncoupling of the glycolysis of the microbiota by the exposure to SF4. In conclusion, the results suggest that SF4 of shiitake has an anticariogenic potential.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cd1","authors":["Zaura E","Buijs MJ","Hoogenkamp MA","Ciric L","Papetti A","Signoretto C","Stauder M","Lingstr\u00f6m P","Pratten J","Spratt DA","Wilson M"],"doi":"10.1155\/2011\/135034","first_seen_on":"2012-01-13T15:47:17+00:00","issns":["1110-7243"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Biomedicine & Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1326468351,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21941428?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC3173737","pmid":"21941428","pubdate":"2011-09-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"HINDAWI PUBLISHING CORPORATION","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","biotechnology"],"title":"The effects of fractions from shiitake mushroom on composition and cariogenicity of dental plaque microcosms in an in vitro caries model.","type":"article","volume":"2011","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-fractions-shiitake-mushroom-composition-cariogenicity-dental-plaque-microcosms-vitro-caries"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506977,"mean":5.1265981649798,"rank":3084162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":969042,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506977,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234503,"mean":4.2702753324068,"rank":146825,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":50214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234503,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":351,"mean":3.1610171428571,"rank":207,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":351,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":139,"mean":3.5074347826087,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":58,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":139,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
