Age, gender, decayed missing and filled teeth (dmft\/DMFT), dental procedures, duration of GA, and posttreatment hospitalization were recorded. Before treatment, dental disease in the primary teeth was significantly higher among the group with SD (p= 0.04). In the permanent teeth, dental disease was higher among the group with DD, though not significantly. More teeth were restored, (p= 0.015) and total dmft (p= 0.043) was significantly higher among subjects with SD. In the permanent teeth, more extracted and more restored teeth and higher DMFT were noted among subjects with DD, though not significantly. Only pulpectomies were significantly more prevalent among those with DD (p= 0.038). Six subjects needed hospitalization due to their diseases after GA.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005faf","doi":"10.1111\/j.1754-4505.2011.00226.x","first_seen_on":"2012-01-11T12:57:48+00:00","issns":["1754-4505"],"issue":"1","journal":"Special Care in Dentistry","last_mentioned_on":1326285730,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22229595?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22229595","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Dental treatment of patients with systemic diseases compared to patients with developmental disabilities under general anesthesia.","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dental-treatment-patients-systemic-diseases-compared-patients-developmental-disabilities-under-gener-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628758,"mean":4.9386506288559,"rank":2902132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":77084,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628758,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231147,"mean":3.9594604968291,"rank":166746,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":675,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231147,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85,"mean":1.9123571428571,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.5625,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/AnestesiaF\/status\/157079854557315073","citation_ids":[555592],"posted_on":"2012-01-11T12:42:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
