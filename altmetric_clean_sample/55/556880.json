Here, we report that a bilayer transparent film containing N-doped CNTs (which are highly catalytic) and normal CNTs (which are highly conductive) as a counter electrode in DSSCs results in efficiencies up to 2.18%, yet still maintains a good transparency with a transmittance of approximately 57% at 550 nm.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e58","authors":["Tantang, Hosea","Kyaw, Aung Ko Ko","Zhao, Yu","Chan\u2010Park, Mary B.","Tok, Alfred Iing Yoong","Hu, Zheng","Li, Lain\u2010Jong","Sun, Xiao Wei","Zhang, Qichun"],"doi":"10.1002\/asia.201100670","endpage":"545","first_seen_on":"2012-01-12T11:05:01+00:00","issns":["1861-471X","1861-4728"],"issue":"3","journal":"Chemistry - An Asian Journal","last_mentioned_on":1326365507,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/asia.201100670"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201100670\/pdf","pmid":"22241687","pubdate":"2012-01-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u00e2\u0080\u0090VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"541","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Nitrogen\u00e2\u0080\u0090Doped Carbon Nanotube\u00e2\u0080\u0090Based Bilayer Thin Film as Transparent Counter Electrode for Dye\u00e2\u0080\u0090Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs)","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nitrogendoped-carbon-nanotubebased-bilayer-thin-film-transparent-counter-electrode-dyesensitized-sol"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6424344,"mean":5.8855119644135,"rank":4746832,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":951254,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6424344,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246188,"mean":4.6227190225318,"rank":155349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":45376,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246188,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1991,"mean":1.2774,"rank":680,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":728,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1991,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":265,"mean":0.94544696969697,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":184,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":265,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
