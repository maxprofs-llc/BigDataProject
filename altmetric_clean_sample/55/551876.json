Children from the general population (n = 658) reported on the level of emotional warmth, rejection, and overprotection of both parents by filling out the child version of the Egna Minnen Betr\u00e4ffande Uppfostran (EMBU-C) and mothers completed the child behavior checklist (CBCL). Intraclass correlations were computed as measures of dissimilarity between parenting styles of mothers and fathers. Children's perceived dissimilarity in parental emotional warmth is associated with internalizing and externalizing problems (\u03b2 = 0.092, p < 0.05; \u03b2 = 0.091, p < 0.05). Perceived dissimilarity between parents' overprotection is associated with externalizing problems (\u03b2 = 0.097, p < 0.05). Perceived dissimilarity between parenting styles is associated with externalizing and internalizing problems, over and above the effects of the level of the parenting styles. The results highlight the negative consequences of perceived dissimilarity between parents. To conclude, children have more internalizing and externalizing problems when they perceive their parents as more dissimilar in parenting styles.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002817","authors":["Myra Berkien","Anneke Louwerse","Frank Verhulst","Jan Ende"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00787-011-0234-9","first_seen_on":"2012-01-08T19:41:30+00:00","issns":["1018-8827","1435-165X"],"journal":"European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1326139207,"links":["http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/content\/t20m566875q506u1\/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22222568?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22222568","pubdate":"2012-01-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychiatry","pediatrics"],"title":"Children\u2019s perceptions of dissimilarity in parenting styles are associated with internalizing and externalizing behavior","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/childrens-perceptions-dissimilarity-parenting-styles-associated-internalizing-externalizing-behavior"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506762,"mean":5.1233691071599,"rank":1688435,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2794706,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506762,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233956,"mean":4.2387546237527,"rank":61569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":170833,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233956,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":489,"mean":3.158631147541,"rank":169,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":318,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":489,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.8343636363636,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
