Technical advancements in the methods of HLA Ab testing have realized rapid, accurate and objective identification, as well as quantification of specific HLA antibodies. Recent clinical studies have suggested that the presence of donor-specific HLA antibodies (DSA) in patients is associated with graft failure in HLA-mismatched SCT when the above-listed stem cell sources are used and results in different impacts. Of note, most of the 'HLA-matched' unrelated SCT actually involve HLA mismatches in HLA-DP and the presence of antibodies against this locus has been reported to be associated with graft failure. Thus, HLA Ab should be examined as a work-up for all patients who undergo SCT from 'alternative donors.' The simplest route for preventing HLA Ab-mediated graft failure in Ab-positive patients is to avoid donors who possess the target Ag of HLA antibodies. If SCT from such donors must be performed, treatment for DSA before SCT may improve the chances of successful donor engraftment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002414","authors":["S Yoshihara","K Taniguchi","H Ogawa","H Saji"],"doi":"10.1038\/bmt.2011.249","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2012-01-14T12:09:39+00:00","issns":["0268-3369"," 1476-5365"],"journal":"Bone Marrow Transplantation","last_mentioned_on":1332661197,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/bmt\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/bmt2011249a.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/bmt\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/abs\/bmt2011249a.html"],"pmid":"22231464","pubdate":"2012-01-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"","title":"The role of HLA antibodies in allogeneic SCT: is the |[lsquo]|type-and-screen|[rsquo]| strategy necessary not only for blood type but also for HLA|[quest]|","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-hla-antibodies-allogeneic-sct-typeandscreen-strategy-necessary-not-only-blood-type-also-hla"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":1989413,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2421952,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234378,"mean":4.2751533469584,"rank":80521,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":146471,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234378,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":871,"mean":4.1486183908046,"rank":476,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":871,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":0.4625,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
