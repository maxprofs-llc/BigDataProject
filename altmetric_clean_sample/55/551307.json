Microvascular free-tissue reconstruction is an important surgical option with the superiority of free muscle and myocutaneous flaps being explored by various publications. Muscle flaps provide good quality vascularized tissue which can be contoured into defects, but their bulk can often lead to the reconstruction having a suboptimal aesthetic outcome. This result is usually most evident in the lower third of the tibia. We present our series of free radial forearm fasciocutaneous flaps for reconstruction of distal third tibial soft-tissue defects following debridement of osteomyelitic foci and bony stabilization.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a2c","authors":["Khan, Muhammad Adil Abbas","Jose, Rajive Mathew","Taylor, Christopher","Ahmed, Waseem","Prinsloo, Daniel"],"doi":"10.1097\/sap.0b013e3182110fb2","first_seen_on":"2012-01-07T18:29:14+00:00","issns":["0148-7043"],"issue":"1","journal":"Annals of Plastic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1348575433,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/annalsplasticsurgery\/Abstract\/2012\/01000\/Free_Radial_Forearm_Fasciocutaneous_Flap_in_the.16.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/annalsplasticsurgery\/2012\/01000\/Free_Radial_Forearm_Fasciocutaneous_Flap_in_the.16.pdf","pmid":"21629109","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"58","subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Free Radial Forearm Fasciocutaneous Flap in the Treatment of Distal Third Tibial Osteomyelitis","type":"article","volume":"68","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/free-radial-forearm-fasciocutaneous-flap-treatment-distal-third-tibial-osteomyelitis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":2007759,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":2992964,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237995,"mean":4.4911963158738,"rank":66959,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":168986,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237995,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1961,"mean":1.0686714285714,"rank":169,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":1785,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1961,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":0.51012658227848,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":78,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":7,"Business, Management and Accounting":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"NI":1,"GB":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/MendietaAesthet\/status\/167998891780882432","citation_ids":[551307],"posted_on":"2012-02-10T15:50:31+00:00","author":{"name":"Mauricio Mendieta,MD","url":"http:\/\/www.mendietaaesthetics.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/793915913091293184\/FjaDHdxt_normal.jpg","description":"Plastic and Reconstructive Microsurgeron.
