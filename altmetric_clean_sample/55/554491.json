Mice were sensitized (allergic group) or not (nonallergic group) with OVA and were fed with OVA diet to induce allergy signals. Mice were fed with regular diet in which 7% of lipid content was provided by soybean (5% of n-3 PUFA) or fish (25% of n-3 PUFA) oil. Allergic group mice had increased serum levels of antiovalbumin IgE and IgG1 and changes in small intestine, characterized by an increased edema, number of rolling leukocytes in microcirculation, eosinophil infiltration, mucus production, and Paneth cell degranulation, in comparison to non-allergic group. All these inflammatory parameters were reduced in mice fed high-n-3-PUFA diet. Our data together suggest that diet supplementation with n-3 PUFA from fish oil may consist of a valid adjuvant in food allergy treatment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002544","authors":["de Matos OG","Amaral SS","Pereira da Silva PE","Perez DA","Alvarenga DM","Ferreira AV","Alvarez-Leite J","Menezes GB","Cara DC"],"doi":"10.1155\/2012\/236564","first_seen_on":"2012-01-10T18:03:30+00:00","issns":["1740-2522"],"issue":"","journal":"Clinical & Developmental Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1326218407,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22162714"],"pmcid":"PMC3227513","pmid":"22162714","pubdate":"2011-12-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Dietary Supplementation with Omega-3-PUFA-Rich Fish Oil Reduces Signs of Food Allergy in Ovalbumin-Sensitized Mice.","type":"article","volume":"2012","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dietary-supplementation-omega3pufarich-fish-oil-reduces-signs-food-allergy-ovalbuminsensitized-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631265,"mean":4.9266893682253,"rank":2740605,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":732886,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631265,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231369,"mean":3.9400850852325,"rank":147813,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":65115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231369,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":274,"mean":2.0460512820513,"rank":191,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":69,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":274,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86,"mean":1.8645882352941,"rank":54,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
