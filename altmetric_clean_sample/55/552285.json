Central within the Global Strategy are the ambitions of \"more money for health\" and \"more health for the money\". These aim to leverage more resources for health financing whilst simultaneously generating more results from existing resources - core tenets of public expenditure management and governance. This paper considers these ambitions from a human resources for health (HRH) perspective.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000830","authors":["James Campbell","Iain Jones","Desmond Whyms"],"doi":"10.1186\/1478-4491-9-18","first_seen_on":"2012-01-09T09:08:14+00:00","issns":["","1478-4491"],"issue":"1","journal":"Human Resources for Health","last_mentioned_on":1326099705,"links":["http:\/\/www.human-resources-health.com\/content\/9\/1\/18","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1478-4491-9-18"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.human-resources-health.com\/content\/pdf\/1478-4491-9-18.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3170569","pmid":"21762511","pubdate":"2011-07-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"18","title":"\"More money for health - more health for the money\": a human resources for health perspective.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/more-money-health-more-health-money-human-resources-health-perspective"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8102415,"mean":6.8892140789079,"rank":4281668,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2250394,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8102415,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250456,"mean":5.1239343115532,"rank":114317,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":99387,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250456,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":533,"mean":7.3493947368421,"rank":489,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":533,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":7.71875,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
