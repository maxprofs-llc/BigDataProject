Because development of TRALI is associated with donor antibodies (Abs) reactive with recipient major histocompatibility complex (MHC), a mouse model has been studied in which TRALI-like disease is caused by injecting mice with anti-MHC class I monoclonal Ab (mAb). Previous publications with this model have concluded that disease is caused by FcR-dependent activation of neutrophils and platelets, with production of reactive oxygen species that damage pulmonary vascular endothelium. In this study, we confirm the role of reactive oxygen species in the pathogenesis of this mouse model of TRALI and show ultrastructural evidence of pulmonary vascular injury within 5 min of anti-MHC class I mAb injection. However, we demonstrate that disease induction in this model involves macrophages rather than neutrophils or platelets, activation of complement and production of C5a rather than activation of Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RIII, or Fc\u03b3RIV, and binding of anti-MHC class I mAb to non-BM-derived cells such as pulmonary vascular endothelium. These observations have important implications for the prevention and treatment of TRALI.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c77","authors":["Strait RT","Hicks W","Barasa N","Mahler A","Khodoun M","K\u00f6hl J","Stringer K","Witte D","Van Rooijen N","Susskind BM","Finkelman FD"],"doi":"10.1084\/jem.20110159","first_seen_on":"2012-01-10T20:05:06+00:00","issns":["0022-1007","1540-9538"],"issue":"12","journal":"The Journal of Experimental Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1327276800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22025304","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1084\/jem.20110159"],"pmid":"22025304","pubdate":"2011-10-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["medicine","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"MHC class I\u2013specific antibody binding to nonhematopoietic cells drives complement activation to induce transfusion-related acute lung injury in mice","type":"article","volume":"208","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mhc-class-ispecific-antibody-binding-nonhematopoietic-cells-drives-complement-activation-induce-tran"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628496,"mean":4.94108381299,"rank":2017144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":936350,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628496,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231350,"mean":3.9625689585866,"rank":100531,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":89533,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231350,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2718,"mean":3.4101729849098,"rank":1418,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":397,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2718,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":151,"mean":3.4484533333333,"rank":128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":151,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
