Management of child sexual abuse is multifaceted and multidisciplinary. Specialized health providers can provide consultation, but this availability does not minimize the role of the referring physician who often has ongoing contact with the family. Physicians are mandated to report cases of suspected or confirmed sexual abuse. In the majority of cases, a child\u2019s statement about sexual abuse is the strongest evidence that abuse has occurred. Physical examination is normal in the majority of sexual abuse victims. Accurate, evidence-based interpretation of physical and laboratory findings is essential. Normal examinations, normal variants, and findings indicative of sexual contact must be differentiated. Forensic evidence collection and prophylactic treatments may be indicated when patients present within 72 hours of an abusive episode, and patients should be triaged accordingly. Potentially negative psychosocial outcomes should be addressed for patients and their families on initial evaluation and follow-up.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f61000848d","doi":"10.1542\/pir.33-1-19","first_seen_on":"2012-01-08T02:06:36+00:00","issns":["\t1526-3347"],"journal":"Pediatrics in Review","last_mentioned_on":1325987655,"links":["http:\/\/pedsinreview.aappublications.org\/content\/33\/1\/19.short"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pedsinreview.aappublications.org\/content\/33\/1\/19.full.pdf","pmid":"22210930","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Sexual Abuse","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sexual-abuse-18"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629591,"mean":4.9337473984712,"rank":2016051,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":939928,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629591,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230544,"mean":3.946255084735,"rank":99952,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":89655,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230544,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":211,"mean":1.9968,"rank":100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":67,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":211,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.3739130434783,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
