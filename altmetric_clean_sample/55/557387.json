Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is a complication observed in patients using oral or intravenous (IV) BPs. It was suggested that all patients undergoing BP therapy who are expected to receive dental implants should be informed of the possible risks of development of ONJ. The aim of this literature review is to assess the osseointegration of dental implants in patients undergoing BP therapy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f7c","authors":["Javed F","Almas K","Fawad Javed","Khalid Almas"],"doi":"10.1902\/jop.2009.090587","first_seen_on":"2012-01-12T16:05:52+00:00","issns":["0022-3492","1943-3670"],"journal":"Journal of Periodontology","last_mentioned_on":1469923200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20367090","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1902\/jop.2009.090587"],"pmid":"20367090","pubdate":"2010-01-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Osseointegration of dental implants in patients undergoing bisphosphonate treatment: a literature review.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.joponline.org\/doi\/10.1902\/jop.2009.090587","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/osseointegration-dental-implants-patients-undergoing-bisphosphonate-treatment-literature-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8156965,"mean":6.8933631772734,"rank":1728110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6416181,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8156965,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250567,"mean":5.1273258622481,"rank":49211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":200754,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250567,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":600,"mean":4.5121469115192,"rank":123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":476,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":600,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.935,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
