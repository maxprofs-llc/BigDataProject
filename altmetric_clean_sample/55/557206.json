These slow oscillations are thought to be involved in NREM sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Although the locus coeruleus (LC) noradrenergic system is known to play a role in off-line memory consolidation (that may occur during NREM sleep), cortico-coerulear interactions during NREM sleep have not yet been studied in detail. Here, we investigated the timing of LC spikes as a function of sleep-associated slow oscillations. Cortical EEG was monitored, along with activity of LC neurons recorded extracellularly, in nonanesthetized naturally sleeping rats. LC spike-triggered averaging of EEG, together with phase-locking analysis, revealed preferential firing of LC neurons along the ascending edge of the EEG slow oscillation, correlating with Down-to-Up state transition. LC neurons were locked best when spikes were shifted forward \u223c50 ms in time with respect to the EEG slow oscillation. These results suggest that during NREM sleep, firing of LC neurons may contribute to the rising phase of the EEG slow wave by providing a neuromodulatory input that increases cortical excitability, thereby promoting plasticity within these circuits.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e36","doi":"10.1093\/cercor\/bhr121","first_seen_on":"2012-01-12T13:39:34+00:00","issns":["1460-2199"],"journal":"Cerebral Cortex","last_mentioned_on":1326374798,"links":["http:\/\/cercor.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/22\/2\/426.abstract?etoc"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/cercor.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/22\/2\/426.full.pdf","pmid":"21670101","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["brain"],"title":"Noradrenergic Neurons of the Locus Coeruleus Are Phase Locked to Cortical Up-Down States during Sleep","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/noradrenergic-neurons-locus-coeruleus-phase-locked-cortical-updown-states-during-sleep"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506977,"mean":5.1265981649798,"rank":3082949,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":965866,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506977,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234584,"mean":4.2564722251828,"rank":146429,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":49369,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234584,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1773,"mean":6.5476218961625,"rank":1333,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":299,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1773,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195,"mean":5.1936907216495,"rank":158,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":5,"Professor > Associate Professor":14,"Researcher":43,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
