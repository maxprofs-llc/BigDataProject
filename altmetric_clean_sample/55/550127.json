Metabolic syndrome includes waist circumference \u2265 90(th) percentile for age, sex and race, higher levels of blood pressure, triglycerides and fasting glucose, and low levels of HDL-cholesterol. Insulin resistance may be present as early as 1 year of age, and obesity and\/or type 2 diabetes are more prevalent in those born SGA than those born AGA. The programming of adaptive responses in children born SGA includes an association with increased blood pressure, changes in endothelial function, arterial properties and coronary disease. Early interventions should be directed to appropriate maternal nutrition, before and during pregnancy, promotion of breast feeding, and prevention of rapid weight gain during infancy, and to promote a healthy lifestyle.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008dce","first_seen_on":"2012-01-06T17:00:25+00:00","issns":["1677-9487"],"issue":"8","journal":"Arquivos Brasileiros de Endocrinologia e Metabologia","last_mentioned_on":1344506953,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22218440?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22218440","pubdate":"2011-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["metabolism","endocrinology"],"title":"Metabolic syndrome in children born small-for-gestational age.","type":"article","volume":"55","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metabolic-syndrome-children-born-smallforgestational-age-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4655094,"mean":5.6505438971925,"rank":3293334,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":760505,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4655094,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234558,"mean":4.4166618604434,"rank":145455,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44008,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234558,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":416,"mean":1.4035421686747,"rank":125,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":62,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":416,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.65625,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
