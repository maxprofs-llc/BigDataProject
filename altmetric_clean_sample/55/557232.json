Cervical subcutaneous and mediastinal emphysemas were observed on CT, and the patient was transferred to the emergency medical center of our hospital on the same day. Esophagography was performed at our department. A ruptured region was identified on the left side of the lower thoracic esophagus, and surgery was emergently performed employing sequential left thoracoabdominal incision. The chest wall was adhered due to inflammation, and large amounts of residual food and sloughing were present in the thoracic cavity and mediastinum. Moreover, necrotic changes were noted in the superior through inferior mediastinum. An about 2-cm rupture site was confirmed on the left side of the lower thoracic esophagus and closed by suture and filling with pediculate omentum. The presence of a tumorous lesion located mainly in the body of the stomach and lymph node enlargement were also diagnosed before surgery, for which gastric and intestinal fistulae were inserted to prepare for the second-stage surgery. The patient was admitted to an ICU after surgery. ARDS and MRSA-induced pneumonia and enteritis concomitantly developed but remitted. Curative surgery for gastric cancer was performed at 40 POD. Spontaneous rupture of the esophagus is relatively rare and that complicated by gastric caner is very rare, with only six cases being reported in Japan. Herein, we report the case.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008b8","authors":["Nobuhisa Matsuhashi","Narutoshi Nagao","Chihiro Tanaka","Takuo Nishina","Masahiko Kawai","Katsuyuki Kunieda","Hitoshi Iwata"],"doi":"10.1186\/1477-7819-9-161","first_seen_on":"2012-01-12T14:03:51+00:00","issns":[""],"issue":"1","journal":"World Journal of Surgical Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1368088038,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3250961\/?tool=pmcentrez"],"pmid":"22145619","pubdate":"2012-01-12T20:11:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"161","subjects":["neoplasms","generalsurgery"],"title":"A patient with spontaneous rupture of the esophagus and concomitant gastric cancer whose life was saved: case of report and review of the literature in Japan","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/patient-spontaneous-rupture-esophagus-concomitant-gastric-cancer-whose-life-saved-case-report-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3684317,"mean":4.9202481350715,"rank":2785918,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":737698,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3684317,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231345,"mean":3.9286940313993,"rank":147793,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":65073,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231345,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":927,"mean":1.6297991360691,"rank":576,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":95,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":927,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":0.96825396825397,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
