Study group subjects were given 45 mg zinc\/p.o.\/day as 200 mg 'zinc sulphate tablets from the day of reporting till term. Body zinc status was clinically assessed by 'zinc taste test'. Blood samples were drawn at the same time and serum zinc levels measured. Zinc taste test scores decreased with advancement of pregnancy (P < 0.05) and increased significantly following zinc administration (P < 0.05). Serum zinc level declined significantly with advancement of pregnancy (P < 0.001). Following zinc administration, serum zinc level increased significantly (P < 0.001). Accuracy of zinc taste test in individual cases ranged between 70 and 100 percent. On the whole, zinc taste test was well correlated with serum zinc level, and provides a fair idea of zinc deficiency.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9153cf058f61000cf06","authors":["Garg, H K","Singal, K C","Arshad, Z"],"first_seen_on":"2012-01-13T08:23:01+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["0019-5499"],"issue":"4","journal":"Indian journal of physiology and pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1502333485,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8112809","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8112809\/"],"pmid":"8112809","pubdate":"1993-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology","pharmacology"],"title":"Zinc taste test in pregnant women and its correlation with serum zinc level.","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/zinc-taste-test-pregnant-women-correlation-serum-zinc-level"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.2,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":3,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8352366,"mean":7.0446264010179,"rank":1362508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":6985599,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8352366,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251982,"mean":5.2181818946669,"rank":39628,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":212225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251982,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147,"mean":5.980301369863,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":2.9,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Chemistry":1,"Social Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":3,"NO":1,"AU":1},"mendeley":{"GT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/robbwolf\/status\/157618032573816833","citation_ids":[558121],"posted_on":"2012-01-13T00:20:42+00:00","author":{"name":"Robb Wolf","url":"http:\/\/robbwolf.com\/wiredtoeat\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2641665487\/f3b893aeb5aba6e626a929078242c6c6_normal.jpeg","description":"Zoe and Sagan's dad.
