These genes could also be enriched into different subgroups based on the analysis of DAVID database, such as \"skeletal system development\", \"forebrain development\", \"limb development\" and \"WNT signaling pathway\". After the analysis from Gene MANIA database, the molecular networks of MSX1, MSX2, HAND2, SIX1, PITX2, OSR2, PAX3 and PRRX1 were built to show that these eight genes exhibited interactions, including co-expression, co-localization, genetic interactions.\nThere are different gene regulating mechanisms between the human mandible- and ilium- derived mesenchymal cells. It implies that genetic modification may be applied to get iliac derived mesenchymal cells to be more suitable for tissue-engineered repair of jaw.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6a13cf058f610009a16","authors":["Yang, Quan-Quan","Wang, Jiao","Li, Zhi-Yong"],"first_seen_on":"2017-08-18T13:09:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1006-7248"],"issue":"2","journal":"Shanghai Journal of Stomatology","last_mentioned_on":1503061745,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28815248?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28815248","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"[Differentially expressed genes between the human mandible- and ilium- derived mesenchymal cells].","type":"article","volume":"26"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8392157,"mean":7.0686031077041,"rank":7254187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8392157,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":165420,"mean":12.802611949051,"rank":135608,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":165420,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":87,"mean":0.65406976744186,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":87,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/WntPublications\/statuses\/898532203872874498","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24028208],"posted_on":"2017-08-18T13:09:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Wnt publications","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/867065609405833216\/3jto4N3b_normal.jpg","description":"Twitterbot on Wnt signaling pathway publications #Wnt #PubMed","id_on_source":"WntPublications","tweeter_id":"866558175335649280","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":23},"tweet_id":"898532203872874498"}]}}
