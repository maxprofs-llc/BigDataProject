The aim of this study was to assess if a preoperative iron-deficiency anaemia management protocol for elective colorectal surgery patients helps improve detection and treatment of iron-deficiency, and improve patient outcomes.\nRetrospective data was collected from 95 consecutive patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery to establish baseline anaemia correction rates and perioperative transfusion rates. A new pathway for early detection of iron-deficiency anaemia, and treatment with intravenous iron replacement, for colorectal cancer patients was then developed and implemented. Data from 81 patients was collected prospectively post-implementation to assess the impact of the pathway.\nPre-intervention data showed anaemic patients were seventeen times more likely to require perioperative transfusion than non-anaemic patients (95% CI 1.9-151.0, p\u00a0=\u00a00.011). Post-intervention, fifteen patients with iron-deficiency were treated with either intravenous (n\u00a0=\u00a08) or oral iron (n\u00a0=\u00a07). Mean Day 3 postoperative haemoglobin levels were significantly lower in patients with uncorrected anaemia (9.5\u00a0g\/dL, p\u00a0=\u00a00.004); those patients whose anaemia was corrected by iron replacement therapy preoperatively had similar postoperative results to non-anaemic patients (10.93\u00a0g\/dL vs 11.4\u00a0g\/dL, p\u00a0=\u00a00.781). Postoperative transfusion rates remained high at 38% in patients with uncorrected anaemia, compared to 0% in corrected anaemia and 3.5% in non-anaemic patients.\nIntroduction of an iron-deficiency anaemia management pathway has resulted in improved perioperative haemoglobin levels, with a reduction in perioperative transfusion, in elective colorectal patients. Implementation of this pathway could result in similar outcomes across other categories of surgical patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079f1","authors":["Edel M.
