The trials searched were evaluated for eligibility. The Cochrane Collaboration's Review Manager software was used to perform meta-analyses.\nEight studies were enrolled, including five randomized controlled trials, one control-matched trial and two retrospective cohort trials. The meta-analysis revealed that MIPO has a longer operating time, longer radiation time and higher incidence rate of soft tissue irritation symptoms than those of CFT. There was no significant difference between the two techniques with regard to union time, the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS), infection rate and various other complications.\nThe present meta-analysis showed that MIPO did not have obvious advantages over CFT in the treatment of distal tibia fracture. However, more rigorous randomized controlled trials are required in the future.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079f1","authors":["Ang Li","Zhijian Wei","Han Ding","Haoshuai Tang","Yang Liu","Jiaxiao Shi","Hengxing Zhou","Shi-Qing Feng"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijsu.2016.12.028","first_seen_on":"2017-08-18T13:40:23+00:00","issns":["17439191"],"journal":"International Journal of Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1481955902,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S1743919116311918&_version=1&md5=999748875214789c121a17d57a6d397f"],"pmid":"27993719","pubdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Minimally invasive percutaneous plates versus conventional fixation techniques for distal tibial fractures: A meta-analysis","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/minimally-invasive-percutaneous-plates-versus-conventional-fixation-techniques-distal-tibial-fractur"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8234883,"mean":6.9712042501575,"rank":6252124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1109548,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8234883,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93148,"mean":11.574394280009,"rank":65466,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":17243,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93148,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1007,"mean":2.1951411530815,"rank":517,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":262,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1007,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":1.7648648648649,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
