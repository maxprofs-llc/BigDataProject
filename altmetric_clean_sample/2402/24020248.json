This text first covers basic aspects of each imaging modality before describing the technical and methodological challenges of combining PET and MRI within a single system. After several years of development, combined and even fully-integrated PET\/MRI systems have become available and made their way into the clinic. This multi-modality imaging system lends itself to the advanced exploration of diseases to support personalized medicine in a long run. To that extent, this paper provides an introduction to PET\/MRI methodology and important technical solutions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002856","authors":["Ivo Rausch","Harald H.
