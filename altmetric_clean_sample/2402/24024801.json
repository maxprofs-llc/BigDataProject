Reliable taxonomic identification to the species-level, however, remains difficult, especially for short-read sequencing platforms, due to incomplete coverage of the 16S rRNA gene. This is especially true for Salmonella enterica, which is often found as a low abundant member of the microbial community, and is often found in combination with several other closely related enteric species. Here, we report on the evaluation and application of Resphera Insight, an ultra-high resolution taxonomic assignment algorithm for 16S rRNA sequences to the species level. The analytical pipeline achieved 99.7% sensitivity to correctly identify S. enterica from WGS datasets extracted from the FDA GenomeTrakr Bioproject, while demonstrating 99.9% specificity over other Enterobacteriaceae members. From low-diversity and low-complexity samples, namely ice cream, the algorithm achieved 100% specificity and sensitivity for Salmonella detection. As demonstrated using cilantro and chili powder, for highly complex and diverse samples, especially those that contain closely related species, the detection threshold will likely have to be adjusted higher to account for misidentifications. We also demonstrate the utility of this approach to detect Salmonella in the clinical setting, in this case, bloodborne infections.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc10","authors":["Grim, Christopher J.","Daquigan, Ninalynn","Lusk Pfefer, Tina S.","Ottesen, Andrea R.","White, James R.","Jarvis, Karen G."],"doi":"10.3389\/fmicb.2017.01587","first_seen_on":"2017-08-18T11:46:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1664-302X"],"journal":"Frontiers in Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1504633061,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fmicb.2017.01587\/full","http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fmicb.2017.01587\/full?utm_source=FRN&utm_medium=EMAIL_IRIS&utm_campaign=EMI_FRN_ARTICLEPUBLISHED_COAUTHORS&utm_content=Twitter_1","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28868052?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28868052?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC5563311","pmid":"28868052","pubdate":"2017-08-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"High-Resolution Microbiome Profiling for Detection and Tracking of Salmonella enterica","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highresolution-microbiome-profiling-detection-tracking-salmonella-enterica"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.08,"score_history":{"1y":10.08,"6m":10.08,"3m":10.08,"1m":10.08,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366342,"mean":7.0541652571821,"rank":852725,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7512624,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366342,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":153858,"mean":12.80285688659,"rank":23567,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":130277,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":153858,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6068,"mean":4.6684123949234,"rank":684,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":5377,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6068,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186,"mean":5.3831351351351,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":156,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Computer Science":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2,"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Resphera\/statuses\/898511311478202368","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24024801],"posted_on":"2017-08-18T11:46:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Resphera Biosciences","url":"http:\/\/respherabio.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/491650535578013697\/Ci_xlw7P_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"Resphera","tweeter_id":"2192656224","geo":{"lt":39.29038,"ln":-76.61219,"country":"US"},"followers":53},"tweet_id":"898511311478202368"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/nur_a_hasan\/statuses\/898586816877441025","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24024801],"posted_on":"2017-08-18T16:46:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Nur A.
