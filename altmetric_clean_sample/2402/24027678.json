BD has clinical overlap with many autoinflammatory diseases (AIDs). The aim of this study was to investigate the role of rare variants in seven genes involved in AIDs: CECR1, MEFV, MVK, NLRP3, NOD2, PSTPIP1 and TNFRSF1A using a next generation sequencing (NGS) approach in 355 BD patients. To check global association of each gene, 4 tests: SKAT, CollapseBt, C(\u03b1) and weighted KBAC were used. Databases: 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3, Infevers, HGMD and ClinVar and algorithms: PolyPhen2 and SIFT were consulted to collect information of the 62 variants found. All the genes resulted associated using SKAT but only 3 (MVK, NOD2 and PSTPIP1) with C(\u03b1) and weighted KBAC. When all the genes are considered, 40 variants were associated to AIDs in clinical databases and 25 were predicted as pathogenic at least by one of the algorithms. Including only MVK, NOD2 and PSTPIP1, the associated to AIDs variants found in BD were 20 and the predicted as pathogenic, 12. The maxima contribution corresponds to NOD2. This study supports influence of rare variants in genes involved in AIDs in the pathogenesis of BD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Sergio Burillo-Sanz","Marco-Antonio Montes-Cano","Jos\u00e9-Ra\u00fal Garc\u00eda-Lozano","Lourdes Ortiz-Fern\u00e1ndez","Norberto Ortego-Centeno","Francisco-Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda-Hern\u00e1ndez","Gerard Espinosa","Genaro Gra\u00f1a-Gil","Juan S\u00e1nchez-Burs\u00f3n","Mar\u00eda Rosa Juli\u00e1","Roser Solans","Ricardo Blanco","Ana-Celia Barnosi-Mar\u00edn","Ricardo G\u00f3mez De la Torre","Patricia Fanlo","M\u00f3nica Rodr\u00edguez-Carballeira","Luis Rodr\u00edguez-Rodr\u00edguez","Teresa Camps","Santos Casta\u00f1eda","Juan-Jose Alegre-Sancho","Javier Mart\u00edn","Mar\u00eda Francisca Gonz\u00e1lez-Escribano"],"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-017-09164-7","first_seen_on":"2017-08-18T12:57:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["2045-2322"],"issue":"1","journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1503066515,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28814775?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28814775?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28814775?dopt=Abstractu0026utm_source=dlvr.itu0026utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28814775","subjects":["science"],"title":"Mutational profile of rare variants in inflammasome-related genes in Beh\u00e7et disease: A Next Generation Sequencing approach","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mutational-profile-rare-variants-inflammasomerelated-genes-beh%C3%A7et-disease-next-generation-sequencing"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8392157,"mean":7.0686031077041,"rank":6368750,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1138161,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8392157,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":165447,"mean":12.800586088512,"rank":117403,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":29825,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":165447,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37279,"mean":14.714110413649,"rank":26878,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":6258,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37279,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3683,"mean":13.186581749049,"rank":2591,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":754,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3683,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CompBiolPapers\/statuses\/898529331651031041","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24027678],"posted_on":"2017-08-18T12:57:41+00:00","author":{"name":"CompBiolPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/848199297611026432\/GiXZ3YhG_normal.jpg","description":"Feed for sequencing papers","id_on_source":"CompBiolPapers","tweeter_id":"2365948482","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":723},"tweet_id":"898529331651031041"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SeqComplete\/statuses\/898552207955636224","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24027678],"posted_on":"2017-08-18T14:28:35+00:00","author":{"name":"SeqComplete","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/432012289185546240\/nESezhJN_normal.jpeg","description":"Latest Buzzz in Cutting-Edge #NGS #Genomics #PersonalizedMedicine #PrecisionMedicine #LiquidBiopsy  #BioIT  #RNASeq #CRISPR #Geneediting #Bigdata","id_on_source":"SeqComplete","tweeter_id":"335246117","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":3090},"tweet_id":"898552207955636224"}]}}
