The wide use of BPA has increased the risk of BPA release into the environment, and it has become a new environmental pollutant. In this work, the ecological deleterious effects of this new pollutant on soybean roots at different growth stages were investigated by determining the contents of mineral elements (P, K, Ca, and Mg) and analyzing root activity and the activities of critical respiratory enzymes (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase). Our results revealed that low dose (1.5mg\/L) of BPA increased the levels of P, K, Mg, and Ca in soybean roots at different growth stages. Whereas, high doses (6.0 and 12.0mg\/L) of BPA decreased the levels of P, K, and Mg contents in a dose-dependent manner. BPA had a promotive effect on the content of Ca in soybean roots. Synchronous observation showed that the aforementioned dual response to BPA were also observed in the root activity and respiratory enzyme activities. The effects of BPA on the mineral element contents, root activity and respiratory enzyme activities in soybean roots at different growth stages followed the order: flowering and podding stage>seed-filling stage>seedling stage (mineral element contents); seedling stage>flowering and podding stage>seed-filling stage (root activity and respiratory enzyme activities). In a word, the response of plant root activity and respiratory enzyme activities to BPA pollution is a pathway of BPA affecting mineral element contents in plant roots.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f6100065db","authors":["Binxin Xia","Lihong Wang","Lijun Nie","Qing Zhou","Xiaohua Huang"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ecoenv.2016.09.028","first_seen_on":"2017-08-18T12:49:38+00:00","issns":["01476513"],"journal":"Ecotoxicology & Environmental Safety","last_mentioned_on":1475887815,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0147651316303815&_version=1&md5=d4e16b8ee551b408c205f932573ad24b"],"pmid":"27723463","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"A pathway of bisphenol A affecting mineral element contents in plant roots at different growth stages","type":"article","volume":"135","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pathway-bisphenol-affecting-mineral-element-contents-plant-roots-different-growth-stages"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8233879,"mean":6.9714785601567,"rank":7124970,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8233879,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93040,"mean":11.555538387128,"rank":75802,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93040,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1490,"mean":2.7203693754197,"rank":996,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1490,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":1.2176119402985,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
