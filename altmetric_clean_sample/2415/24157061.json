Here, on the level of micromagnetics we rigorously show that chiral magnets can not only host skyrmions but also antiskyrmions as least energy configurations over all non-trivial homotopy classes. We derive practical criteria for their occurrence and coexistence with skyrmions that can be fulfilled by (110)-oriented interfaces depending on the electronic structure. Relating the electronic structure to an atomistic spin-lattice model by means of density functional calculations and minimizing the energy on a mesoscopic scale by applying spin-relaxation methods, we propose a double layer of Fe grown on a W(110) substrate as a practical example. We conjecture that ultra-thin magnetic films grown on semiconductor or heavy metal substrates with C 2v symmetry are prototype classes of materials hosting magnetic antiskyrmions.Skyrmions, localized defects in the magnetization, can be stabilised in materials by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). Hoffmann et al. predict that, when the DMI is anisotropic, antiskyrmions can be formed and coexist with skyrmions, enabling studies and exploitation of their interactions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Markus Hoffmann","Bernd Zimmermann","Gideon P.
