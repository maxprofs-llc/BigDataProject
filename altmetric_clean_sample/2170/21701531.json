Subjects consumed either a 4.2-MJ\/d diet (50 g protein, 175 g carbohydrate) or a 2.1-MJ\/d diet (50 g protein, 75 g carbohydrate). Body composition and leucine oxidation and turnover were determined before and after weight loss. Energy deficit was calculated from resting metabolic rates. Subjects fed the 2.1-MJ\/d diet showed a greater weight loss (6.1 +\/- 0.5 vs 4.5 +\/- 0.5 kg; mean +\/- SE, P less than 0.05) and fat loss (3.9 +\/- 0.3 vs 3.0 +\/- 0.3 kg, P less than 0.05). Weight loss-energy deficit ratio was the same with both diets. Nitrogen balance and leucine oxidation and turnover were similar in both groups. We conclude that with feeding of isonitrogenous hypoenergetic diets, severe restriction of energy content (2.1 MJ\/d, 75 g carbohydrate) will enhance weight and fat loss without increasing nitrogen loss compared with mild restriction of energy (4.2 MJ\/d).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005700","authors":["Stanko, R T","Tietze, D L","Arch, J E"],"first_seen_on":"2017-07-10T05:02:19+00:00","issns":["0002-9165"],"issue":"4","journal":"American Journal of Clinical Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1322323200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1414962"],"pmid":"1414962","pubdate":"1992-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Body composition, nitrogen metabolism, and energy utilization with feeding of mildly restricted (4.2 MJ\/d) and severely restricted (2.1 MJ\/d) isonitrogenous diets.","type":"article","volume":"56","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/body-composition-nitrogen-metabolism-energy-utilization-feeding-mildly-restricted-42-mjd-severely-re"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8039257,"mean":6.8266728911201,"rank":903702,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7089960,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8039257,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103240,"mean":10.618640862465,"rank":16202,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":86852,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103240,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5953,"mean":26.481793010753,"rank":2451,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3355,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5953,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":48.937868852459,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"A Brief Response to Taubes&#39;s Food Reward Critique, and a Little Something Extra","url":"http:\/\/wholehealthsource.blogspot.com\/2011\/11\/brief-response-to-taubess-food-rewad.html","license":"public","citation_ids":[21701521,21701522,1418741,21701523,14656519,21701525,21701526,1139273,1392635,2145092,1767385,248295,121233,21701527,21701528,21611611,21611613,21611614,21611619,21611621,1172700,191532,1392636,1487555,3070784,2462278,1678135,4951557,664684,21701530,1544722,21701531,612624,1487705,1323450,1469481],"posted_on":"2011-11-26T16:00:00+00:00","summary":"It appears Gary Taubes has completed his series critiquing the food reward hypothesis of obesity (1).\u00a0 I have to hand it to him, it takes some cojones to critique an entire field of research, particularly when you have no scientific background in it.The fo","author":{"name":"Whole Health Source","url":"http:\/\/wholehealthsource.blogspot.com\/","description":"A blog about health, food, science, and whatever else captures my interest."}}]}}
