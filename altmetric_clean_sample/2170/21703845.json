By varying the precursor concentration, the assembly of graphene aerogel can be easily regulated, yielding different micro-structures and morphologies which accelerate fast electron\/ion transportation. The N-GR\/NF composites demonstrate enhanced capacitance of 250 F g-1 at 5 A g-1, good rate performance (237 F\/g at the current density of 12 A\/g) and cycle stability (90.9% retention after 5000 cycles) in 1 M KOH electrolyte. This study provides a new strategy for microporous engineering of graphene gel, promising be further exploited to various other applications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003146","authors":["Faze Wang","Maojun Zheng","Liguo Ma","Qiang Li","Jingnan Song","Yuxiu You","Li Ma","Wenzhong Shen"],"doi":"10.1088\/1361-6528\/aa79e4","first_seen_on":"2017-07-10T06:39:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0957-4484","1361-6528"],"journal":"Nanotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1503067709,"links":["https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1088\/1361-6528\/aa79e4","http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/article\/10.1088\/1361-6528\/aa79e4\/meta"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/article\/10.1088\/1361-6528\/aa79e4\/pdf","pmid":"28617671","pubdate":"2017-06-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"IOP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Nickel skeleton three-dimensional nitrogen doped graphene nanosheets\/nanoscrolls as promising supercapacitor electrodes","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8392157,"mean":7.0686031077041,"rank":4479977,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2336070,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8392157,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230035,"mean":12.844147134771,"rank":128476,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":79649,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230035,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1619,"mean":5.9257490729295,"rank":828,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":566,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1619,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":2.9039591836735,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"googleplus":[{"title":"PAPER Nickel skeleton three-dimensional nitrogen doped graphene nanosheets\/nanoscrolls as promising ...","url":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/+CharlesRaimbault\/posts\/WXCBeU45XKw","license":"public","citation_ids":[21703845],"posted_on":"2017-08-18T14:48:29+00:00","summary":"PAPER Nickel skeleton three-dimensional nitrogen doped graphene nanosheets\/nanoscrolls as promising ...
