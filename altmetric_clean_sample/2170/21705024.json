Amygdalin MF was given alone and in combination with beta-glucosidase which was administered 1\/2 hour prior to amygdalin MF, starting 24 hours after tumor implantation. No antitumor activity was observed in any of the four tumor systems tested with the drug alone or in combined therapy. The combined therapy showed potentiation of toxicity with doses of amygdalin MF greater than or equal to 100 mg\/kg.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9153cf058f61000cee0","authors":["Wodinsky, I","Swiniarski, J K"],"first_seen_on":"2017-07-10T07:18:09+00:00","issns":["0069-0112"],"issue":"5","journal":"Cancer chemotherapy reports Part 1","last_mentioned_on":1480250341,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1203898?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"1203898","pubdate":"1975-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms","pharmacology"],"title":"Antitumor activity of amygdalin MF (NSC-15780) as a single agent and with beta-glucosidase (NSC-128056) on a spectrum of transplantable rodent tumors.","type":"article","volume":"59"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8040010,"mean":6.8290546008064,"rank":1141882,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6824686,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8040010,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103384,"mean":10.62303051759,"rank":19294,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":83315,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103384,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":2.6944444444444,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Apricot Seeds: Cancer Treatment or Danger to Health?","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=28739451753&p=1pl&v=1&x=1u3ujYOm6FmF8Mrc2zS8_g","license":"public","citation_ids":[985792,1387042,14111117,2394583,14111119,14111120,21705021,3960556,106379,3333445,14111124,14111125,21705024,2394591,1387042],"posted_on":"2016-11-27T12:39:01+00:00","summary":"Abdel-Rahman, M.
