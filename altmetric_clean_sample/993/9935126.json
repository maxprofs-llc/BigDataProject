The study groups were divided into 2 groups as groups A and B. The patients in group A had severe NSD, and 1 of the nasal cavity was obstructed totally or near totally. In group B, the NSD narrowed the nasal passage, and the deviation was not severe. The voice performance was analyzed preoperatively, and 1 month after surgery with both objective and subjective methods. Objective analysis included acoustic voice analysis, and measurement of F0, jitter %, shimmer %. Preoperative and postoperative F0, jitter %, shimmer %, and Voice Handicap Index-30 (VHI-30) were compared in groups A and B.\nF0 showed a statistically significant improvement after surgery in group A (P\u200a<0.001). Jitter %, shimmer %, and VHI-30 scores also improved after surgery, without any statistical significance. In group B, preoperative and postoperative F0, jitter %, and shimmer % were similar. However, VHI-30 scores showed a significant improvement postoperatively (P\u200a=\u200a0.005). Comparison of groups A and B for improvements of the voice parameters revealed that group A showed improvements in all voice parameters, and the improvements of F0 and shimmer % were statistically significant.\nSeptoplasty performed for severe NSD obstructing nasal lumen totally or near totally results in significant improvements in the voice performance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007c24","authors":["Atan, Dogan","\u00d6zcan, K\u00fcrsat Murat","G\u00fcrb\u00fcz, Ayse Bet\u00fcl Topak","Dere, H\u00fcseyin","Do\u011fan Atan","K\u00fcr\u015fat Murat \u00d6zcan","Ay\u015fe Bet\u00fcl Topak G\u00fcrb\u00fcz","H\u00fcseyin Dere"],"doi":"10.1097\/scs.0000000000002794","endpage":"1164","first_seen_on":"2016-07-22T01:14:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1536-3732","1049-2275"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Craniofacial Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1469329540,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jcraniofacialsurgery\/Abstract\/2016\/07000\/The_Effect_of_Septoplasty_on_Voice_Performance_in.12.aspx","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1097\/scs.0000000000002794"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jcraniofacialsurgery\/2016\/07000\/The_Effect_of_Septoplasty_on_Voice_Performance_in.12.pdf","pmid":"27380579","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1162","subjects":["dentistry","generalsurgery"],"title":"The Effect of Septoplasty on Voice Performance in Patients With Severe and Mild Nasal Septal Deviation","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jcraniofacialsurgery\/Fulltext\/2016\/07000\/The_Effect_of_Septoplasty_on_Voice_Performance_in.12.aspx","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-septoplasty-voice-performance-patients-severe-mild-nasal-septal-deviation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8098931,"mean":6.8880547472244,"rank":7011363,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8098931,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257290,"mean":11.94236748559,"rank":217322,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257290,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3358,"mean":0.66261364313375,"rank":1002,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3358,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185,"mean":0.41603260869565,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JCSOnline1\/statuses\/756296132263718912","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9935126],"posted_on":"2016-07-22T01:13:43+00:00","author":{"name":"JCS Online","url":"http:\/\/www.jcraniofacialsurgery.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1397343347\/JCranioSurg_square_normal.jpg","description":"The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery serves as a forum of communication for all those involved in craniofacial and maxillofacial surgery.","id_on_source":"JCSOnline1","tweeter_id":"317871694","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":118},"tweet_id":"756296132263718912"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JCSOnline1\/statuses\/757049081566855168","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9935126],"posted_on":"2016-07-24T03:05:40+00:00","author":{"name":"JCS Online","url":"http:\/\/www.jcraniofacialsurgery.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1397343347\/JCranioSurg_square_normal.jpg","description":"The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery serves as a forum of communication for all those involved in craniofacial and maxillofacial surgery.","id_on_source":"JCSOnline1","tweeter_id":"317871694","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":118},"tweet_id":"757049081566855168"}]}}
