Eighty consecutive patients with squamous cell carcinoma of cervix received (18)FDG PET\/CT scan before treatment. Metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG) and the peak standardized uptake value (SUVpeak) of the cervical tumors were calculated by an iterative adaptive algorithm. The association of these metabolic markers with serum squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-ag), International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, maximum tumor size and depth of cervical stromal invasion of the tumor was determined by the multivariate analysis. MTV and TLG were significantly higher in subjects with serum SCC-ag levels \u22653.95, with FIGO stage 1b2 and with a maximum tumor size of \u22654\u2005cm (p\u22640.009). Higher SUVpeak levels were associated with a maximum tumor size of \u22654\u2005cm and with a cervical stromal invasion depth of \u22651\/2 (p\u22640.003). Multivariate analysis indicated that MTV was independently associated with FIGO stage Ib2 (p=0.041) and depth of cervical stromal invasion (p=0.020). TLG and SUVpeak were independently associated with maximum tumor size (p\u22640.004) and depth of cervical stromal invasion (p\u22640.013). Significant linear correlation was found between SUVpeak and tumor size; the Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.34 (p=0.002). Metabolic parameters such as MTV, TLG and SUVpeak are able to predict clinical and pathological status in preoperative cervical cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cfd","authors":["Xu, Weina","Yu, Shupeng","Xin, Jun","Guo, Qiyong"],"doi":"10.1136\/jim-2016-000166","first_seen_on":"2016-07-21T18:50:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1708-8267","1081-5589"],"journal":"Journal of Investigative Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1469168529,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27436350?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27436350?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27436350","pubdate":"2016-07-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"jim-2016-000166","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"\n              Relationship of\n              18\n              F-FDG PET\/CT metabolic, clinical and pathological characteristics of primary squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix\n            ","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8091619,"mean":6.8840984628706,"rank":4045535,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3839845,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8091619,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258146,"mean":11.985977222103,"rank":130285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":117433,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258146,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":332,"mean":2.9693897280967,"rank":104,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":208,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":332,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":2.78125,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/petctimaging\/statuses\/756373751894122496","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9930250],"posted_on":"2016-07-22T06:22:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Tom","url":"http:\/\/www.usmolecular.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2411402290\/ms2zbkt4yzm2bbe4j7vi_normal.jpeg","description":"PET\/CT imaging.","id_on_source":"petctimaging","tweeter_id":"228235116","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2898},"tweet_id":"756373751894122496"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/molecularimging\/statuses\/756199501430398977","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9930250],"posted_on":"2016-07-21T18:49:45+00:00","author":{"name":"Molecular Imaging","url":"http:\/\/www.medjournal.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1081930767\/fdg_normal.PNG","description":"PET\/CT, MRI, CT, and other molecular imaging news and updates.
