The two types, sporadic and familial differ in the aetiopathogenesis but have a similar neuropathology characterized by oxidative stress, excitotoxicity and inflammation. The disease is also characterized by a non-cell autonomous mechanism with astrocytes playing a central role by affecting synaptic glutamate, the blood-brain barrier, and metabolic and trophic support. Two types of therapeutic approaches focusing on astrocytes are presented: a) emerging molecular targets (potassium inward rectifier channels and aquaporins at the astrocyte endfeet, and IP3 receptor signaling pathway), and b) cell therapy with stem cell - generated and transplanted astrocytes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026ad","authors":["Peri\u0107, Mina  "," Mitre\u010di\u0107, Dinko "," Andjus,  Pavle  R."],"doi":"10.2174\/1381612823666170615110446","first_seen_on":"2017-06-24T05:20:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1381-6128"],"journal":"Current Pharmaceutical Design","last_mentioned_on":1498842849,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28619002"],"pmid":"28619002","pubdate":"2017-06-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Targeting astrocytes for treatment in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/targeting-astrocytes-treatment-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":7,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":1240959,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":7128997,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239563,"mean":12.919149297468,"rank":50822,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":187126,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239563,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1548,"mean":4.6040310277957,"rank":182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":1331,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1548,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":1.9530952380952,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Targeting astrocytes for treatment in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=30999693906&p=1pl&v=1&x=IkUOepzNc3n3nUYBS5hnrA","license":"public","citation_ids":[21316505],"posted_on":"2017-06-24T05:13:42+00:00","summary":".
