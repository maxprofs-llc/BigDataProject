The mid-point potentials for the oxidized-semiquinone and semiquinone-hydroquinone couples of flavodoxins isolated from facultative anaerobe Klebsiella pneumoniae (nifF-gene product, KpFld) and the obligate aerobe Azotobacter chroococcum (AcFld) were determined as a function of pH. The mid-point potentials of the semiquinone-hydroquinone couples of KpFld and AcFld are essentially independent of pH over the range pH 7-9, being -422 mV and -522 mV (normal hydrogen electrode) at pH 7.5 respectively. The mid-point potentials of the quinone-semiquinone couples at pH 7.5 are -200 mV (KpFld) and -133 mV (AcFld) with delta Em\/pH of -65 +\/- 4 mV (KpFld) and -55 +\/- 2 mV (AcFld) over the range pH 7.0-9.5. This indicates that reduction of the quinone is coupled to protonation to yield a neutral semiquinone. The significance of these values with respect to electron transport to nitrogenase is discussed. The amino acid compositions, the N- and C-terminal amino acid sequences and the u.v.-visible spectra of KpFld and AcFld were determined and are compared with published data for flavodoxins isolated from Azotobacter vinelandii.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c1","authors":["Deistung, J","Thorneley, R N"],"first_seen_on":"2016-11-18T04:43:46+00:00","issns":["0264-6021"],"issue":"1","journal":"Biochemical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1479444219,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3541922"],"pmcid":"PMC1147240","pmid":"3541922","pubdate":"1986-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Electron transfer to nitrogenase.
