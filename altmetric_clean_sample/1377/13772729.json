However, fish and seafood are also excellent sources of good quality proteins and emerging documentation show that, upon digestion, these proteins are sources for bioactive peptides with documented favorable physiological effects such as antioxidative, antihypertensive and other cardioprotective effects. This documentation is mainly from in vitro studies, but also animal studies are arising. Evidence from human studies evaluating the positive health effects of marine proteins and peptides are scarce. In one study, a reduction in oxidative stress after intake of cod has been documented and a few human clinical trials have been performed evaluating the effect on blood pressure. The results are, however, inconclusive. The majority of the human clinical trials performed to investigate positive health effects of marine protein and lean fish intake, has focused on blood lipids. While some studies have documented a reduction in triglycerides after intake of lean fish, others have documented no effects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f61000668a","authors":["Ida-Johanne Jensen"],"doi":"10.3390\/md14110211","first_seen_on":"2016-11-18T02:40:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1660-3397"],"issue":"11","journal":"Marine Drugs","last_mentioned_on":1499335200,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-3397\/14\/11\/211?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-3397\/14\/11\/211","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3390\/md14110211","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27869700"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-3397\/14\/11\/211\/pdf","pmid":"27869700","pubdate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"211","subjects":["biology","pharmacology"],"title":"Preclinical and Clinical Studies on Antioxidative, Antihypertensive and Cardioprotective Effect of Marine Proteins and Peptides\u2014A Review","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/preclinical-clinical-studies-antioxidative-antihypertensive-cardioprotective-effect-marine-proteins"},"altmetric_score":{"score":20,"score_history":{"1y":20,"6m":9,"3m":9,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":20},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8170401,"mean":6.9145194585267,"rank":419201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7748367,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8170401,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269524,"mean":12.023336917443,"rank":23761,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":245679,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269524,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1046,"mean":3.5406277511962,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":1021,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1046,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":3.1024242424242,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":98}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"MX":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RamonElizaldeN\/statuses\/799442070192549888","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13772729],"posted_on":"2016-11-18T02:40:17+00:00","author":{"name":"Ramon Humberto","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/879108639642058752\/Z-OQgpTN_normal.jpg","description":"Hay una fuerza motriz m\u00e1s poderosa que el vapor, la electricidad y la energ\u00eda at\u00f3mica: la voluntad.\n@AlbertEinstein","id_on_source":"RamonElizaldeN","tweeter_id":"792248012651102208","geo":{"lt":29.0971,"ln":-110.95749,"country":"MX"},"followers":289},"tweet_id":"799442070192549888"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Marine_Drugs\/statuses\/800864793213038592","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13772729],"posted_on":"2016-11-22T00:53:40+00:00","author":{"name":"Marine Drugs_MDPI","url":"https:\/\/t.co\/qFW8OaUMfh","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/642171701116071936\/zNYS3NbE_normal.png","description":"An open access journal on the research, development, and production of  drugs from the sea, including marine natural product chemistry.","id_on_source":"Marine_Drugs","tweeter_id":"3616087756","followers":183},"tweet_id":"800864793213038592"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/EElvevoll\/statuses\/801425912860381184","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13772729],"posted_on":"2016-11-23T14:03:22+00:00","author":{"name":"Edel O.
