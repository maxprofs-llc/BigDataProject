Due to the claimed anticonvulsant properties of G. elata, it is expected that this herb continues to be a target of research, aiming to deepen the available knowledge on its biological activity and safety.\nThe current review aims to discuss the most recent advances on the elucidation of the phytochemical composition and anticonvulsant potential of G. elata.\nAvailable literature was reviewed from PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge and Science Direct, using combinations of the following keywords: Gastrodia elata, tianma, epilepsy, anticonvulsant and pharmacokinetics. Abstracts and full texts were evaluated for their clarity and scientific merit.\nG. elata rhizome, as well as specific phenolic compounds isolated from this herb, have demonstrated anticonvulsant potential in a variety of in vitro and in vivo models. The pharmacological mechanisms potentially involved in the anticonvulsant activity have been extensively studied, being similar to the known mechanisms claimed for the available antiepileptic drugs. In addition, the pharmacokinetics of the main bioactive component of G. elata (gastrodin) has also been studied.\nDue to its recognised therapeutic properties, G. elata has gained an increasing interest within the scientific community and, therefore, new medicinal preparations containing G. elata rhizome itself or its bioactive components are expected to be developed in the coming years. Moreover, specific phytochemical constituents isolated from G. elata may also be considered to integrate programs of discovery and development of new anticonvulsant drug candidates.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005c39","authors":["Mariana Matias","Samuel Silvestre","Am\u00edlcar Falc\u00e3o","Gilberto Alves"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.phymed.2016.09.001","endpage":"1526","first_seen_on":"2016-11-18T06:42:39+00:00","issns":["1618-095X","0944-7113","09447113"],"issue":"12","journal":"Phytomedicine","last_mentioned_on":1501875635,"links":["https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/307997308_Gastrodia_elata_and_epilepsy_Rationale_and_therapeutic_potential","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27765372?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27765372\/"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Mariana_Matias2\/publication\/307997308_Gastrodia_elata_and_epilepsy_Rationale_and_therapeutic_potential\/links\/5804e20e08aef87fbf3ba401.pdf","pmid":"27765372","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1511","subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"Gastrodia elata and epilepsy: Rationale and therapeutic potential","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gastrodia-elata-epilepsy-rationale-therapeutic-potential"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.9,"score_history":{"1y":4.9,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8320311,"mean":7.0122256031246,"rank":1693615,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6623193,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8320311,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278423,"mean":11.883318056762,"rank":75200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":202989,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278423,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":807,"mean":5.8388263027295,"rank":201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":605,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":807,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":2.49208,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
