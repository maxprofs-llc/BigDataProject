Sampled individuals were grouped as follows: patients with Chagas disease, not vaccinated with BCG, who further developed pulmonary tuberculosis; individuals with Chagas disease BCG-vaccinated; and subjects with Chagas disease, presenting neither BCG scar nor tuberculosis disease. Nonvaccinated individuals or without tuberculosis, presented the highest values of anti-PH (p<0.001), anti-FRA (p<0.001), anti-p2\u03b2 (p = 0.0023) and anti-B13 (p<0.001) antibodies. Present findings constitute the first demonstration on the potential influence of concomitant tuberculosis on Chagas disease.","altmetric_jid":"53222dc82a83ee27268b457a","authors":["Luz Peverengo","Estefan\u00eda Prochetto","Luz Rodeles","Ignacio Valenzuela","Iv\u00e1n Sergio Marcipar","Oscar Bottasso","Miguel Hern\u00e1n Vicco"],"doi":"10.1093\/femspd\/ftw109","first_seen_on":"2016-11-18T04:21:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2049-632X"],"journal":"Pathogens and Disease","last_mentioned_on":1481728328,"links":["http:\/\/femspd.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/11\/03\/femspd.ftw109","http:\/\/femspd.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/74\/9\/ftw109","http:\/\/m.femspd.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/74\/9\/ftw109"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/femspd.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/femspd\/early\/2016\/11\/03\/femspd.ftw109.full.pdf","pmid":"27815312","pubdate":"2016-11-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Oxford University Press","startpage":"ftw109","title":"\n              Antibody profiles induced by\n              T. cruzi\n              in chagasic patients with previous or current exposure to mycobacteria\n            ","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":2.6,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7885400,"mean":6.6781117138083,"rank":3122868,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4738410,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7885400,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254797,"mean":12.092988681141,"rank":95183,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":158214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254797,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":314,"mean":3.2328626198083,"rank":98,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":211,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":314,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":3.0942666666667,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"UG":1,"GB":1,"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IDPractitioner\/statuses\/799467362370076674","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13774153],"posted_on":"2016-11-18T04:20:47+00:00","author":{"name":"ID Practitioner","url":"http:\/\/idpractitioner.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/877596104862425088\/tCbm8usk_normal.jpg","description":"The independent news source for infectious disease specialists","id_on_source":"IDPractitioner","tweeter_id":"4073202853","geo":{"lt":39.084,"ln":-77.15276,"country":"US"},"followers":108},"tweet_id":"799467362370076674"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ahabwe_pharma\/statuses\/799491908942839808","license":"gnip","rt":["IDPractitioner"],"citation_ids":[13774153],"posted_on":"2016-11-18T05:58:19+00:00","author":{"name":"Peter B Ahabwe","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/795536281984004097\/ziRxf26g_normal.jpg","description":"Antimicrobial Security Researcher, Antimicrobial Stewardship (Infectious Diseases) Pharmacist, Critical Thinking Consultant","id_on_source":"ahabwe_pharma","tweeter_id":"794113400754335746","geo":{"lt":0.31628,"ln":32.58219,"country":"UG"},"followers":53},"tweet_id":"799491908942839808"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/FEMSTweets\/statuses\/809017660470128640","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13774153],"posted_on":"2016-12-14T12:50:15+00:00","author":{"name":"FEMS","url":"http:\/\/www.fems-microbiology.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/780772140442349568\/a3IuFMTF_normal.jpg","description":"ADVANCING AND UNIFYING MICROBIOLOGY","id_on_source":"FEMSTweets","tweeter_id":"112386661","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":5177},"tweet_id":"809017660470128640"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Naomi_OUP\/statuses\/809038237855584256","license":"gnip","rt":["FEMSTweets"],"citation_ids":[13774153],"posted_on":"2016-12-14T14:12:01+00:00","author":{"name":"Naomi Reeves","url":"http:\/\/www.oupmediainfo.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/751060304826605568\/OAmCJELX_normal.jpg","description":"Ad Sales Manager for a great list of scientific and medical journals at OUP.
