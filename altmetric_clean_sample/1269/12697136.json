For a long time it has been accepted that the main problem in the anterior knee pain (AKP) patient is in the patella. Currently, literature supports the link between abnormal hip function and AKP. Objective. Our objective is to investigate if Cam femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) resolution is related to the outcome in pain and disability in patients with chronic AKP recalcitrant to conservative treatment associated with Cam FAI. Material and Methods. A retrospective study on 7 patients with chronic AKP associated with FAI type Cam was performed. Knee and hip pain were measured with the visual analogue scale (VAS), knee disability with the Kujala scale, and hip disability with the Nonarthritic Hip Score (NAHS). Results. The VAS knee pain score and VAS hip pain score had a significant improvement postoperatively. At final follow-up, there was significant improvement in all functional scores (Kujala score and NAHS). Conclusion. Our finding supports the link between Cam FAI and AKP in some young patients. Assessment of Cam FAI should be considered as a part of the physical examination of patients with AKP, mainly in cases with pain recalcitrant to conservative treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5303cf058f610004382","authors":["Sanchis-Alfonso, Vicente","Tey, Marc","Monllau, Joan Carles"],"doi":"10.1155\/2015\/937431","endpage":"4","first_seen_on":"2016-10-18T06:24:14+00:00","issns":["2090-1542","2090-1550"],"journal":"Pain Research & Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1476771841,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26451254"],"pmid":"26451254","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"1","title":"A Novel Association between Femoroacetabular Impingement and Anterior Knee Pain","type":"article","volume":"2015","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-association-between-femoroacetabular-impingement-anterior-knee-pain-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7556298,"mean":6.524637537139,"rank":3903496,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2115108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7556298,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236348,"mean":12.5273316945,"rank":129721,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":83432,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236348,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110,"mean":4.4937247706422,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":3.2,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/FisioWhat\/statuses\/788264352327540736","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12697136],"posted_on":"2016-10-18T06:24:01+00:00","author":{"name":"FisioWhat?","url":"https:\/\/fisiowhat.wordpress.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/646342083138031616\/7ChBs3Gi_normal.jpg","description":"Blog de fisioterapia, salud y ejercicio f\u00edsico.
