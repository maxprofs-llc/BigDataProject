Three subgroup-defining LTPA features were identified and were considered as primary exposures in Cox proportional hazard models: frequency of activity, number of activity types (variety), and energy-to-duration ratio (EDR). We considered cardiovascular mortality and non-cardiovascular mortality as outcomes in Cox cause-specific proportional hazard models, and all-cause mortality as outcome in Cox models.\nA high activity frequency was associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio, HR\u2009=\u20090.93, P\u2009=\u20090.03), but demonstrated no effect on non-cardiovascular death. A high EDR was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular death (HR\u2009=\u20091.30, P\u2009=\u20090.01). A high number of activity types was beneficial in reducing all-cause mortality (HR\u2009=\u20090.87, P\u2009=\u20090.01).\nExercise frequency was protective against cardiovascular mortality, and a high variety of activity was protective against all-cause mortality. The performance of frequent and varied non-intense exercise in an elderly population such as ours is achievable and can reduce the risk of death.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c43","authors":["Ying Kuen Cheung","Yeseon P.
