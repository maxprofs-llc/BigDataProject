FC results may be hampered by the scarce viability and low cellularity of the specimens.\nWe developed a single-tube FC assay (STA) that included 10 antibodies cocktailed in 8-color labeling, a cell viability dye, and a logical gating strategy to detect NHL in hypocellular samples. The results were correlated with CM and confirmed by histologic or molecular data when available.\nUsing the STA, we detected B-type NHL in 31 out of 103 hypocellular samples (81 FNA and 22 SCE). Of these, 8 were not confirmed by CM and 2 were considered to be only suspicious. The FC-negative samples had a final diagnosis of benign\/reactive process (42\/72), carcinoma (27\/72), or Hodgkin lymphoma (3\/72).\nThe STA approach allowed obtainment of maximum immunophenotyping data in specimens containing a low number of cells and a large amount of debris. The information obtained by STA can help cytomorphologists not only to recognize but also to exclude malignant lymphomas.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006838","authors":["Stacchini, A.","Demurtas, A.","Aliberti, S.","Barreca, A.","Novero, D.","Pacchioni, D."],"doi":"10.1159\/000448799","endpage":"394","first_seen_on":"2016-10-18T00:56:14+00:00","issns":["1938-2650"],"issue":"4","journal":"Acta Cytologica","last_mentioned_on":1473783186,"links":["http:\/\/www.karger.com\/Article\/Abstract\/448799?utm_content=buffer69f2d&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.karger.com\/Article\/Pdf\/448799","pmid":"27597993","pubdate":"2016-09-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Karger Publishers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"385","subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Single-Tube Flow Cytometry Assay for the Detection of Mature Lymphoid Neoplasms in Paucicellular Samples","type":"article","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/singletube-flow-cytometry-assay-detection-mature-lymphoid-neoplasms-paucicellular-samples"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372629,"mean":7.0578283965246,"rank":4466945,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2330378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372629,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249177,"mean":12.751142397341,"rank":137581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":87875,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249177,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":166,"mean":1.7530424242424,"rank":70,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":79,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":166,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":2.75,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/FlowParadigm\/statuses\/775729023808835584","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12692497],"posted_on":"2016-09-13T16:13:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Flow Paradigm","url":"http:\/\/www.flowparadigm.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000397432394\/ce967e6eb21df2de9f1fea41ccb7ee30_normal.jpeg","description":"Flow Cytometry CRO","id_on_source":"FlowParadigm","tweeter_id":"1720350074","geo":{"lt":32.71533,"ln":-117.15726,"country":"US"},"followers":365},"tweet_id":"775729023808835584"}]}}
