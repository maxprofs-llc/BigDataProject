A lot of effort has already been put into better X-ray optics, scintillators and detectors in order to minimize the appearance of these artefacts. However, additional processing is often required after standard flat-field correction. Several methods exist to suppress artefacts. One group of methods is based on minimization of the Tikhonov functional. An analytical formula for processing of a single sinogram was developed. In this paper a similar approach is used and a formula for processing two-dimensional projections is found. Thus suppression of ring artefacts is organized as a two-dimensional convolution of `averaged' projections with a given filter. Several approaches are discussed in order to find elements of the filter in a faster and accurate way. Examples of experimental datasets processed by the proposed method are considered.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f4b","authors":["Titarenko, V."],"doi":"10.1107\/s160057751601479x","first_seen_on":"2016-10-18T00:00:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1600-5775"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Synchrotron Radiation (International Union of Crystallography - IUCr)","last_mentioned_on":1478064429,"links":["http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?S160057751601479X","http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?yn5008&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?yn5008&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?yn5008"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.iucr.org\/s\/issues\/2016\/06\/00\/yn5008\/yn5008.pdf","pmid":"27787251","pubdate":"2016-10-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"International Union of Crystallography","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Optical Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
