The aim of the study was to examine the associations between intestinal permeability and type 2 diabetes (T2D).\nA total of 130 individuals with T2D (age: 57.5\u00b16.2 years (mean\u00b1SD); BMI: 30.4\u00b13.2; 45% female) and 161 individuals without T2D (age: 37.4\u00b112.5 years; BMI: 25.1\u00b13.9; 65% female) were included in the study. Assessment of intestinal permeability included measurement of circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS), LPS-binding protein (LBP) and intestinal fatty acid binding protein (iFABP) concentrations, which were used for calculation of a derived permeability risk score (PRS). Associations between permeability measures and T2D status were assessed using logistic regression models.\nLBP (\u223c34%, P<0.001), iFABP (\u223c46%, P<0.001) and the PRS (\u223c24% P<0.001) were all significantly higher in the T2D affected individuals. Individuals with a PRS in the upper tertile were 5.07 times more likely (CI: 1.72-14.95; P=0.003) to have T2D when models were adjusted for age, sex and BMI. There was a trend towards improved prediction when including the PRS in models containing age, sex and BMI (AUC: 0.954 versus 0.962; P=0.06).\nThese data demonstrate differences in measures of intestinal permeability between individuals with and without T2D. The utility of using intestinal permeability measures as a tool for predicting T2D risk in at risk individuals should be further investigated.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f6100070fb","authors":["A.J.
