Clinical diagnosis, details and serology were recorded. Primary RP was defined as RP with no features of connective tissue disease (CTD)\/antibody. NFC patterns were determined: normal, non-specific, 'early', 'active' or 'late' SSc patterns. Fulfilment of the VEDOSS or 2013 ACR\/EULAR criteria for SSc was determined following NFC assessment.\nThree hundred forty-seven patients were referred: mean (SD) age 47 (15.2) years. On clinical review, 54 (16\u00a0%) did not have RP, 69 (20\u00a0%) had primary RP, 52 (15\u00a0%) had SSc and 172 (50\u00a0%) had secondary RP. NFC SSc pattern was detected in 80 (23\u00a0%) patients; 37\/52 with SSc, 30\/172 with secondary RP, 9\/69 with primary RP and 4\/54 with no RP. For identifying patients who met either the VEDOSS or 2013 ACR\/EULAR criteria for SSc, detection of a SSc NFC pattern had a sensitivity of 71\u00a0%, specificity 95\u00a0%, positive predictive value 84\u00a0% and negative predictive value 90\u00a0%.\nThe absence of SSc NFC pattern in patients with RP or suspected CTD is very valuable in the exclusion of SSc.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007ca","authors":["Lesley-Anne Bissell","Lesley-Anne Bissell","Giuseppina Abignano","Paul Emery","Francesco Del Galdo","Maya H.
