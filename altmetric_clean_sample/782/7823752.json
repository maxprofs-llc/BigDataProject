Diameters of hepatic veins increased from 4.4 mm \u00b1 0.9 (range, 3.3-7 mm) at a peripheral position to 8.7 mm \u00b1 3.0 (range, 5.0-15.5 mm; P < .001) at a central position, and respective pressures decreased from 10.9 mm Hg \u00b1 3.7 (range, 3-17 mm Hg) to 7.4 mm Hg \u00b1 3.7 (range, 0-14 mm Hg; P < .001). Gradients between wedged hepatic vein pressure and central free hepatic vein, IVC, and right atrium pressures were 17.2 mm Hg \u00b1 5.4 (range, 4-33 mm Hg), 18.0 mm Hg \u00b1 5.8 (range, 4-33 mm Hg), and 20.0 mm Hg \u00b1 5.9 (range, 4-33 mm Hg), respectively. Pearson correlation coefficients were 0.679 between the HVPG and hepatic atrial pressure gradient (HAPG) and 0.889 between the wedged hepatic vein\/IVC pressure gradient (HCPG) and HAPG.\nFVHP measurement depends on catheter tip position and vein morphology. Its use to calculate HVPG is not recommended. The high agreement between the HCPG and the HAPG suggests that both gradients may be used if one considers a systemic difference of 2 mm Hg.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f16","authors":["Martin R\u00f6ssle","Philipp Blanke","Benjamin Fritz","Michael Schultheiss","Dominik Bettinger"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jvir.2016.03.028","first_seen_on":"2016-05-19T23:45:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1535-7732"],"journal":"Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology","last_mentioned_on":1463701480,"links":["http:\/\/www.jvir.org\/article\/S1051-0443(16)00436-X\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jvir.org\/article\/S105104431600436X\/pdf","pmid":"27212121","pubdate":"2016-05-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["radiology"],"title":"Free Hepatic Vein Pressure Is Not Useful to Calculate the Portal Pressure Gradient in Cirrhosis: A Morphologic and Hemodynamic Study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/free-hepatic-vein-pressure-not-useful-calculate-portal-pressure-gradient-cirrhosis-morphologic-hemod"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7719347,"mean":6.622418915792,"rank":5837754,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1041190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7719347,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269212,"mean":11.505454294215,"rank":188318,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":44535,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269212,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1184,"mean":5.4177937447168,"rank":968,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":150,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1184,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73,"mean":4.9604166666667,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/FareedRiyazMD\/statuses\/733443283938988032","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7823752],"posted_on":"2016-05-19T23:44:40+00:00","author":{"name":"Fareed Riyaz","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/647859840337997824\/KyOAf8m6_normal.jpg","description":"Fareed Riyaz, MD.
