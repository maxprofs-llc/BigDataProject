The feasibility and efficacy of valve-in-valve implantation in degenerated surgical aortic bioprostheses have also been described and can currently be considered a valuable treatment option in patients deemed unsuitable for repeat cardiac surgery. However, the clinical use of TAVR devices is not limited to the treatment of the tricuspid stenotic aortic valve. Several additional indications including treatment of the bicuspid stenotic aortic valve, aortic regurgitation, and valve-in-valve or valve-in-ring implantation in the mitral or tricuspid position as well as treatment of pure mitral, tricuspid, or pulmonary regurgitation have been described. The purpose of the present review is to summarize the available evidence concerning the emerging off-label use of TAVR devices in current clinical practice. Case examples have been selected to highlight the main procedural steps of each particular intervention.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007acb","authors":["Fabien Praz","Stephan Windecker","Christoph Huber","Thierry Carrel","Peter Wenaweser"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jcin.2015.08.015","endpage":"1796","first_seen_on":"2016-11-07T20:43:38+00:00","issns":["1876-7605","1936-8798"],"issue":"14","journal":"JACC Cardiovascular Interventions","last_mentioned_on":1451163736,"links":["http:\/\/interventions.onlinejacc.org\/mobile\/article.aspx?articleID=2476582#.VnjiBkIst5Y.twitter","http:\/\/interventions.onlinejacc.org\/mobile\/article.aspx?articleid=2476582"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/Interventions.onlinejacc.org\/data\/Journals\/JCIN\/934779\/08015.pdf","pmid":"26718509","pubdate":"2015-12-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Journal of the American College of Cardiology","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1777","subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Expanding Indications of Transcatheter\u00a0Heart Valve Interventions","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expanding-indications-transcatheter-heart-valve-interventions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6882666,"mean":6.1770215490633,"rank":2951859,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":3775554,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6882666,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":204929,"mean":11.925491889834,"rank":90854,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":108975,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":204929,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":740,"mean":7.7378592692828,"rank":423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":303,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":740,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":11.381081081081,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
