In turn, a large portion of life Science researchers could not communicate and help to develop therapeutic potential laid in these therapeutic approaches. In this study, we began to quantify descriptive classification theory in one of the CAM branches i.e. Iranian traditional medicine (ITM). Using proteomic tools and network analysis, the expressed proteins and their relationships were studied in mitochondrial lysate isolated from PBMCs from two different temperaments i.e. Hot-wet (HW) and Cold-dry (CD). The 82% of the identified proteins are over- or under-represented in distinct temperaments. Also, our result showed the different protein-protein interaction networks (PPIN) represented in these two temperaments using centrality and module finding analysis. Following the gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis, we have found enriched biological terms in each group which are in conformity with the physiologically known evidence in ITM. In conclusion, we argued that the network biology which naturally consider life at the system level along with the different omics data will pave the way toward explicit delineation of the CAM activities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Hassan Rezadoost","Mehrdad Karimi","Mohieddin Jafari"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep30133","first_seen_on":"2016-07-27T01:22:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1502976938,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep30133"],"pmcid":"PMC4959000","pmid":"27452083","pubdate":"2016-07-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Protein\u2013protein interaction networks","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Molecular medicine","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"30133","subjects":["science"],"title":"Proteomics of hot-wet and cold-dry temperaments proposed in Iranian traditional medicine: a Network-based Study","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/proteomics-hotwet-colddry-temperaments-proposed-iranian-traditional-medicine-networkbased-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8389481,"mean":7.0670107241375,"rank":3348057,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":5014149,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8389481,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260470,"mean":12.013083092421,"rank":90980,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":168092,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260470,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37266,"mean":14.711516221656,"rank":13881,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":23142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37266,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3276,"mean":16.220789007634,"rank":1165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2089,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3276,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
