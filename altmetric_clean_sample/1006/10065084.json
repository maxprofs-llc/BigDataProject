The recommended classification scheme is based on the expertise of the committee members, extensive review of the literature and feedback from presentations at national and international meetings. Each category of the classification system is closely defined and link to a known risk for malignancy. The classification contains six categories designated as: 1) Non-diagnostic; 2) Negative for Malignancy; 3) Atypical; 4) Neoplastic (Benign and low grade cancer); 5) Suspicious for Malignancy; and 6) Malignant.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c6","authors":["Layfield, L J","Layfield, L.
