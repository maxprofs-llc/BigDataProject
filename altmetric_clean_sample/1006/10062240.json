Recently, these two technologies have been combined in a range of different applications, demonstrating very significant and occasionally surprising synergetic effects. In this book chapter, the advantages and limitations of the IL\/US combination in different chemical applications are critically reviewed in order to understand how, and in which respects, it could become an essential tool of sustainable chemistry in the future. Fundamental aspects and practical considerations of the combination are discussed to better control and demonstrate the brought synergetic effects.","authors":["Gregory Chatel"],"doi":"10.1007\/s41061-016-0055-x","first_seen_on":"2016-07-27T05:47:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2364-8961","2365-0869"],"issue":"4","journal":"Topics in Current Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1469890337,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s41061-016-0055-x"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs41061-016-0055-x.pdf","pmid":"27573403","pubdate":"2016-07-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","title":"Ultrasound in Combination with Ionic Liquids: Studied Applications and Perspectives","type":"article","volume":"374","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ultrasound-combination-ionic-liquids-studied-applications-perspectives"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.05,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.05},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
