Besides the host genetics and socioeconomic status, several other environmental exposures have been linked with an AA etiology. We aimed to examine the association of various environmental exposures with AA occurrence among Pakistani individuals.\nA case-control study was conducted in Karachi, Pakistan, where cases (diagnosed AA patients) were selected from the National Institute of Blood Disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation (NIBD), while for each case, a single control (who was free of AA and visited the outpatient department of the same hospital for the treatment of minor ailments) was selected matched by age and sex. A total of 428 participants were included in this study with equal proportions of cases and controls. Information related to disease characteristics, sociodemographics and exposure to chemicals was collected through a survey questionnaire, laboratory investigations and medical records. Descriptive results were reported as frequencies and proportions, adjusted odds ratios with 95\u00a0% confidence intervals and population attributable risk (PAR) as percentage.\nAmong study participants (n\u2009=\u2009428), AA was significantly associated with various environmental exposures. Participants residing in rural settings (OR\u2009=\u20092.29, 95\u00a0% CI 1.12-4.67, p-value\u2009<\u20090.01) and those who reported exposure to pesticides (OR\u2009=\u20093.58, 95\u00a0% CI 1.27-10.10, p-value 0.01; PAR\u2009=\u200918.16\u00a0%) were significantly more likely to report AA. Participants with a formal education were significantly less likely to have AA (OR\u2009=\u20090.27, 95\u00a0% CI 0.10-0.71, p-value\u2009<\u20090.01).\nThis study observed a significant association of aplastic anemia with a lower socioeconomic profile, and certain environmental exposures among the Pakistani population. The evidence may be helpful in understanding the pathophysiology of aplastic anemia in the context of environmental exposures.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a98","authors":["Mehwesh Taj","Tayyaba Shah","Syeda Kanwal Aslam","Sidra Zaheer","Faryal Nawab","Sumaira Shaheen","Kashif Shafique","Tahir Sultan Shamsi","Taj, Mehwesh","Shah, Tayyaba","Aslam, Syeda Kanwal","Zaheer, Sidra","Nawab, Faryal","Shaheen, Sumaira","Shafique, Kashif","Shamsi, Tahir Sultan"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10389-016-0743-6","first_seen_on":"2016-07-27T06:03:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2198-1833","1613-2238"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1474644905,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10389-016-0743-6\/fulltext.html?wt_mc=alerts.TOCjournals"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10389-016-0743-6.pdf","pmid":"27695669","pubdate":"2016-06-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Epidemiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Health Promotion and Disease Prevention","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Environmental determinants of aplastic anemia in Pakistan: a case-control study","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s10389-016-0743-6","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/environmental-determinants-aplastic-anemia-pakistan-casecontrol-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8422812,"mean":7.0866213065837,"rank":6391344,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1144336,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8422812,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260737,"mean":12.028181378865,"rank":182676,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":44389,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260737,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1309,"mean":9.4215336391437,"rank":1112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1309,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":5.9731707317073,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
