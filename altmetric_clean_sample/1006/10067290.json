Data was collected from a clinical sample (N\u00a0=\u00a082) of patients with depression and\/or anxiety participating in randomized controlled trial of Internet-based affect-focused treatment, and a university student sample (N\u00a0=\u00a0197). The internal consistency for the total score was satisfactory (Clinical sample \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.88\/Student sample \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.84) as well as for all the affective domains, except Anger\/Assertion (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.44\/0.36), Sadness\/Grief (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.24\/0.46) and Attachment\/Closeness (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.67\/0.69). Test retest reliability was satisfactory (ICC\u00a0>\u00a00.77) for the total score and for all the affective domains except for Sadness\/Grief (ICC\u00a0=\u00a00.04). The exploratory factor analysis resulted in a six-factor solution and did only moderately match the test's original affective domains. An empirical cut-off between the clinical and the university student sample were calculated and yielded a cut-off of 72 points. As expected, the Affect Phobia test showed negative significant correlations in the clinical group with measures on depression (rxy \u00a0=\u00a0-0.229; p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and anxiety (rxy \u00a0=\u00a0-0.315; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The conclusion is that the psychometric properties are satisfactory for the total score of the Affect Phobia Test but not for some of the test's affective domains. Consequently the domains should not be used as subscales. The test can discriminate between individuals who seek help for psychological problems and those who do not.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100034c7","authors":["Frankl, My","Philips, Bj\u00f6rn","Berggraf, Lene","Ulvenes, P\u00e5l","Johansson, Robert","Wennberg, Peter","My Frankl","Bj\u00f6rn Philips","Lene Berggraf","P\u00e5l Ulvenes","Robert Johansson","Peter Wennberg"],"doi":"10.1111\/sjop.12308","endpage":"488","first_seen_on":"2016-07-27T13:13:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1467-9450","00365564"],"issue":"5","journal":"Scandinavian Journal of Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1469625198,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/sjop.12308"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/sjop.12308\/pdf","pmid":"27461917","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"482","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Psychometric properties of the Affect Phobia Test","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/sjop.12308","volume":"57","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/psychometric-properties-affect-phobia-test"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8137857,"mean":6.8794880300098,"rank":7047505,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8137857,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257611,"mean":11.921722301152,"rank":217818,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257611,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":367,"mean":5.6265956284153,"rank":316,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":367,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":5.4676470588235,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
