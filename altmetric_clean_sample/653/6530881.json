Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is a major regulator of the RAS in tissues, as it metabolizes angiotensin (Ang) II to Ang-(1-7). The aim of this study was to determine the effects of ACE2 deficiency on physical performance and physiological adaptations induced by voluntary running. Physical performance, body composition and plasma angiotensin levels, as well as tissue morphology and gene expression of RAS components in the left ventricle (LV) and skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius), were evaluated in ACE2-deficient (ACE2(-\/y)) and wild-type (ACE2(+\/y)) mice after 6 weeks of voluntary wheel running. ACE2(-\/y) mice run less than ACE2(+\/y) mice (19\u00b14.7 vs. 26\u00b112.6 revolutions per day \u00d7 100, P<0.01). The ACE2(+\/y) group presented a lower fat mass (15\u00b11.1%) and higher muscle mass (76.6\u00b11.6%) after 6 weeks of voluntary running compared with the sedentary control group (fat mass: 18.3\u00b12.1%; muscle mass: 72.7\u00b12.2). However, no change in body composition was observed in ACE2(-\/y) mice after exercise. Heart and skeletal muscle hypertrophy was observed only in trained ACE2(+\/y) mice. Besides a small decrease in Ang I in ACE2(-\/y) mice, plasma levels of angiotensin peptides remained unchanged by exercise or ACE2 deficiency. In the LV of trained animals, AT2 gene expression was higher in ACE2(+\/y) compared with ACE2(-\/y) mice. ACE2 deficiency leads to an increase in AT1 gene expression in skeletal muscle. ACE expression in soleus was increased in all exercised groups. ACE2 deficiency affects physical performance and impairs cardiac and skeletal muscle adaptations to exercise.Hypertension Research advance online publication, 7 April 2016; doi:10.1038\/hr.2016.28.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f610007694","authors":["Daisy Motta-Santos","Robson Augusto Souza dos Santos","Marilene Oliveira","Fatimunnisa Qadri","Marko Poglitsch","Valentina Mosienko","Lenice Kappes Becker","Maria Jose Campagnole-Santos","Joseph M Penninger","Natalia Alenina","Michael Bader"],"doi":"10.1038\/hr.2016.28","first_seen_on":"2016-04-07T15:30:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0916-9636","1348-4214"],"issue":"7","journal":"Hypertension Research","last_mentioned_on":1468221389,"links":["http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/hr\/rss\/aop\/~3\/aoGdl-lqX84\/hr.2016.28","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/hr\/journal\/v39\/n7\/abs\/hr201628a.html"],"pmid":"27053009","pubdate":"2016-04-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Effects of ACE2 deficiency on physical performance and physiological adaptations of cardiac and skeletal muscle to exercise","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-ace2-deficiency-physical-performance-physiological-adaptations-cardiac-skeletal-muscle-exerc-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8063512,"mean":6.842512696265,"rank":1125359,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6930536,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8063512,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275353,"mean":11.388624633197,"rank":55452,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":219505,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275353,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":471,"mean":4.3356170212766,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":414,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":471,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":5.8578947368421,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Sports and Recreations":1,"Earth and Planetary Sciences":1,"Computer Science":1}}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Effects of ACE2 deficiency on physical performance and physiological adaptations of cardiac and skeletal muscle to exercise","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=26093476551&p=1pl&v=1&x=WQT_Fk5d3KT4hBIA4SdUTQ","license":"public","citation_ids":[6530881],"posted_on":"2016-04-07T15:26:50+00:00","summary":"Related Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical and Healthcare News Original Article: NEXT ARTICLE More From BioPortfolio on \"Effects of ACE2 deficiency on physical performance and physiological adaptations of cardiac and skeletal muscle to exercise\".","author":{"name":"Bioportfolio","url":"http:\/\/www.bioportfolio.com\/","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/000\/821\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2015-12-11_at_16.36.54.png?1449851849"}}],"facebook":[{"title":"Hypertension Research - Abstract of article: Prenatal hypoxia in rats increased blood pressure...","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1035290093206130&id=330879976980482","license":"public","citation_ids":[6011012,6530881,6431878],"posted_on":"2016-07-11T07:16:29+00:00","summary":"7\u6708\u53f7\u30cf\u30a4\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u8ad6\u6587\uff088\u67084\u65e5\u307e\u3067\u7121\u6599\u3067\u304a\u8aad\u307f\u9802\u3051\u307e\u3059\uff09\nPrenatal hypoxia in rats increased blood pressure and sympathetic drive of the adult offspring\nPavel Svitok, et al\thttp:\/\/www.nature.com\/hr\/journal\/v39\/n7\/abs\/hr201621a.html\nEffects of ACE2 deficiency on physical performance an","author":{"name":"\u65e5\u672c\u9ad8\u8840\u5727\u5b66\u4f1a Japan Society of Hypertension","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/330879976980482","facebook_wall_name":"\u65e5\u672c\u9ad8\u8840\u5727\u5b66\u4f1a Japan Society of Hypertension","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/330879976980482\/picture","id_on_source":"330879976980482"}}]}}
