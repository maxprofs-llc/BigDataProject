Twenty-five primiparous dairy goats (crosses of Toggenburg, French Alpine and Saanen; 45\u00b74 \u00b1 1\u00b70 kg BW) were fed a basal diet (10\u00b710% CP, 6\u00b713 DP and 2\u00b734 Mcal\/kg ME) of corn silage, oat hay, alfalfa hay and concentrate (80% forage, 20% concentrate). After kidding, the treatments, which consisted of four oral doses of ruminally protected methionine (RPM) at 0, 1, 2 and 3 g\/d, were randomly assigned to the goats. The experiment was conducted for 110 d with measurements of milk production and composition, body weight and dry matter intake. No treatment effects were detected in milk production and composition. However, goats with RPM showed a positive live weight changes during lactation which were improved as dose was increased (linear P < 0\u00b701) whereas goats without RPM showed weight loss during the experiment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c31","authors":["Alonso-M\u00e9lendez, Erick","Mendoza, Germ\u00e1n D","Castrej\u00f3n-Pineda, Francisco A","Ducoing-Watty, Andr\u00e9s E"],"doi":"10.1017\/s002202991600011x","endpage":"3","first_seen_on":"2016-04-07T18:17:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1469-7629","0022-0299"],"journal":"Journal of Dairy Research","last_mentioned_on":1460053026,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27048778?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27048778","pubdate":"2016-04-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"1","title":"Milk production in dairy goats supplemented with different levels of ruminally protected methionine","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/milk-production-dairy-goats-supplemented-different-levels-ruminally-protected-methionine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7516464,"mean":6.5017388130518,"rank":5689963,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1005455,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7516464,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270837,"mean":11.237194087935,"rank":190366,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":41942,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270837,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138,"mean":1.8647445255474,"rank":89,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.425,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Environmental Science":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"KE":1,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/goat_papers\/statuses\/718140558913351680","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6536544],"posted_on":"2016-04-07T18:17:06+00:00","author":{"name":"goatpapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/558367908275822592\/MZjFXuZV_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"goat_papers","tweeter_id":"2992530750","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":51},"tweet_id":"718140558913351680"}]}}
