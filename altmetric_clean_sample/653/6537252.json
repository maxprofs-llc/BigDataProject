Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) promote a decreased expression of inflammatory molecules. We aimed to study whether PPAR stimulation by clofibrate decreases inflammation and reduces infarct size in rats with MI. Male Wistar rats were randomized into 3 groups: control, MI + vehicle, and MI + clofibrate (100 mg\/kg). Treatment was administered for 3 consecutive days, previous to 2 h of MI. MI induced an increase in protein expression, mRNA content, and enzymatic activity of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Additionally, MI incited an increased expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, and IL-6. MI also elevated the nuclear content of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and decreased I\u03baB, both in myocyte nuclei and cytosol. Clofibrate treatment prevented MI-induced changes in iNOS, MMP-2 and MMP-9, ICAM-1, IL-6, NF-\u03baB, and I\u03baB. Infarct size was smaller in clofibrate-treated rats compared to MI-vehicle animals. In silico analysis exhibited 3 motifs shared by genes from renin-angiotensin system, PPAR\u03b1, iNOS, MMP-2 and MMP-9, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1, suggesting a cross regulation. In conclusion, PPAR\u03b1-stimulation prevents overexpression of pro-inflammatory molecules and preserves viability in an experimental model of acute MI.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000db0","authors":["Ibarra-Lara, Mar\u00eda de la Luz","S\u00e1nchez-Aguilar, Mar\u00eda","Soria, Elizabeth","Torres-Narv\u00e1ez, Juan Carlos","Del Valle-Mondrag\u00f3n, Leonardo","Cervantes-P\u00e9rez, Luz Graciela","P\u00e9rez-Severiano, Francisca","Ram\u00edrez-Ortega, Margarita Del Carmen","Pastel\u00edn-Hern\u00e1ndez, Gustavo","Oidor-Chan, V\u00edctor Hugo","S\u00e1nchez-Mendoza, Alicia"],"doi":"10.1139\/cjpp-2015-0356","endpage":"9","first_seen_on":"2016-04-07T18:47:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1205-7541","0008-4212"],"journal":"Canadian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1460105279,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27050838?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27050838","pubdate":"2016-01-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["physiology","pharmacology"],"title":"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) downregulate the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules in an experimental model of myocardial infarction","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/peroxisome-proliferatoractivated-receptors-ppar-downregulate-expression-proinflammatory-molecules-ex-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7520778,"mean":6.5030037002784,"rank":3665368,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3665388,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7520778,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270868,"mean":11.238030391299,"rank":135800,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":124829,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270868,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":705,"mean":2.7342471590909,"rank":290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":396,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":705,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":3.7162105263158,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
