The RNFL thickness measured by the SD-OCT (sdRNFL thickness) and SS-OCT (ssRNFL thickness) were compared using the t-test. Bland-Altman analysis was performed to examine their agreement. We compared areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve and examined sdRNFL and ssRNFL thickness for discriminating glaucomatous eyes from healthy eyes, and from glaucoma suspect eyes.\nThe average ssRNFL thickness was significantly greater than sdRNFL thickness in healthy (110.0 \u00b1 7.9 vs. 100.1 \u00b1 6.8 \u00b5m, p < 0.001), glaucoma suspect (96.8 \u00b1 9.3 vs. 89.6 \u00b1 7.9 \u00b5m, p < 0.001), and glaucomatous eyes (74.3 \u00b1 14.2 vs. 69.1 \u00b1 12.4 \u00b5m, p = 0.011). Bland-Altman analysis showed that there was a tendency for the difference between ssRNFL and sdRNFL to increase in eyes with thicker RNFL. The area under the curves of the average sdRNFL and ssRNFL thickness for discriminating glaucomatous eyes from healthy eyes (0.984 vs. 0.986, p = 0.491) and glaucoma suspect eyes (0.936 vs. 0.918, p = 0.132) were comparable.\nThere was a tendency for ssRNFL thickness to increase, compared with sdRNFL thickness, in eyes with thicker RNFL. The ssRNFL thickness had comparable diagnostic capability compared with sdRNFL thickness for discriminating glaucomatous eyes from healthy eyes and glaucoma suspect eyes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f9d","authors":["Ha, Ahnul","Lee, Seung Hyen","Lee, Eun Ji","Kim, Tae-Woo"],"doi":"10.3341\/kjo.2016.30.2.140","first_seen_on":"2016-04-07T16:06:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1011-8942","2092-9382"],"issue":"2","journal":"Korean Journal of Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1460045195,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27051263?dopt=Abstract#pubmed"],"pmid":"27051263","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"140","subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer Thickness Measurement Comparison Using Spectral Domain and Swept Source Optical Coherence Tomography","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/retinal-nerve-fiber-layer-thickness-measurement-comparison-using-spectral-domain-swept-source-optica-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7516464,"mean":6.5017388130518,"rank":6511211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7516464,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270838,"mean":11.237179920025,"rank":228896,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270838,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177,"mean":0.73948863636364,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.875,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OCTMD\/statuses\/718107713624997889","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6532419],"posted_on":"2016-04-07T16:06:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Brandon Lujan, MD","url":"http:\/\/OCTMD.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/459117248297189376\/n_gr2d1r_normal.jpeg","description":"Medical Retina and Imaging Specialist with Expertise in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT).","id_on_source":"OCTMD","tweeter_id":"244660420","geo":{"lt":37.77493,"ln":-122.41942,"country":"US"},"followers":1320},"tweet_id":"718107713624997889"}]}}
