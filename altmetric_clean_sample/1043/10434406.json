Although rheumatic diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) differ in their pathogenesis and clinical presentation, the treatment of these inflammatory disorders overlaps. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs are used to reduce pain and inflammation. Additional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs are prescribed to slowdown disease progression, and is in RA more frequently and effectively applied than in AS. Biologicals are a relatively new class of treatments that specifically target cytokines or cells of the immune system, like tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors or B-cell blockers. A new kid on the block is the interleukin-17 (IL-17) inhibitor secukinumab, which has been recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and AS. IL-17 is a proinflammatory cytokine that has an important role in host defense, but its proinflammatory and destructive effects have also been linked to pathogenic processes in autoimmune diseases like RA and psoriasis. Animal models have greatly contributed to further insights in the potential of IL-17 blockade in autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases, and have resulted in the development of various potential drugs targeting the IL-17 pathway. Secukinumab (AIN457) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to IL-17A and recently entered the market under the brand name Cosentyx(\u00ae). By binding to IL-17A, secukinumab prevents it from binding to its receptor and inhibits its ability to trigger inflammatory responses that play a role in the development of various autoimmune diseases. With secukinumab being the first in class to receive Food and Drug Administration approval, this article will further focus on this new biologic agent and review the milestones in its development and marketing.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bbff","authors":["Marije Koenders","Wim van den Berg","Marije I Koenders","Wim B van den Berg"],"doi":"10.2147\/dddt.s105263","endpage":"2080","first_seen_on":"2016-08-12T08:39:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1177-8881"],"journal":"Drug Design, Development and Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1494935197,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/secukinumab-for-rheumatology-development-and-its-potential-place-in-th-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-DDDT","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4928657\/figure\/f1-dddt-10-2069\/?utm_content=buffer34118&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4928657\/figure\/f1-dddt-10-2069\/?utm_content=buffer7dfb6&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27445458\/"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=31062","pmcid":"PMC4928657","pmid":"27445458","pubdate":"2016-06-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"2069","subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Secukinumab for rheumatology: development and its potential place in therapy","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/secukinumab-rheumatology-development-potential-place-therapy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.1,"score_history":{"1y":4.1,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8213437,"mean":6.9553152651275,"rank":1781816,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6421441,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8213437,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257290,"mean":12.003204451026,"rank":71601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":185113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257290,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1041,"mean":3.7918269230769,"rank":125,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":913,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1041,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71,"mean":10.247857142857,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":61,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
