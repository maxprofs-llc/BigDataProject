Alterations of the SATB2 gene can result from a variety of different mechanisms that include contiguous deletions, intragenic deletions and duplications, translocations with secondary gene disruption, and point mutations. The multisystemic nature of this syndrome demands a multisystemic approach and we propose evaluation and management guidelines. The SATB2-associated syndrome registry has now been started and that will allow gathering further clinical information and refining the provided surveillance recommendations. \u00a9 2016 The Authors.
