Limitation of deflection (functional metric) was tested by measuring the difference in maximal upward and downward angle of deflection of a ureteroscope with and without a basket in place.\nThe Sacred Heart Halo 1.5F basket had the highest mean force required to perforate the foil at 0.676N +\/- 0.117 (p<0.0001). The Sacred Heart Halo 1.5F basket also had the highest mean radial dilation force at 3.04 g +\/- 0.15 (p<0.0001). The Cook NCircle 2.2F had the most linear pattern of opening, while the Coloplast No-Tip Dormia 2.2F and the Sacred Heart Halo 1.5F exhibited exponential opening dynamics. The Cook NCircle 2.2F limited scope deflection the most with a decrease in 4\u00b0 downward and 10\u00b0 upward. The Sacred Heart Halo 1.5F had the least influence on deflection with a decrease in 3\u00b0 downward and 5\u00b0 upward.\nThe penetration force, radial dilation force, opening dynamics and resistance to deflection varied between 5 commonly available tipless nitinol stone baskets. A small diameter 1.5F basket is capable of providing optimal performance, while sacrificing linear opening.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036e4","authors":["Nishant Patel","Arash Akhavein","Bryan Hinck","Rajat Jain","Manoj Monga"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.urology.2017.01.010","first_seen_on":"2017-01-17T02:16:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1527-9995","00904295"],"journal":"Urology","last_mentioned_on":1484698713,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.goldjournal.net%2Farticle%2FS0090-4295%2817%2930037-7%2Ffulltext%3Frss%3Dyes&code=url-site","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=1&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.goldjournal.net%2Farticle%2FS0090-4295%2817%2930037-7%2Ffulltext%3Frss%3Dyes&code=url-site","http:\/\/www.goldjournal.net\/article\/S0090-4295(17)30037-7\/fulltext?rss=yes"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.goldjournal.net\/article\/S0090429517300377\/pdf","pmid":"28104422","pubdate":"2017-01-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Tipless Nitinol Stone Baskets: Comparison of Penetration Force, Radial Dilation Force, Opening Dynamics, and Deflection","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":1.35,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082727,"mean":6.8629605662661,"rank":3978405,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4041961,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082727,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258119,"mean":12.8589474039,"rank":132344,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":122983,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258119,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3242,"mean":4.148480098735,"rank":1669,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":1520,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3242,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180,"mean":4.9259776536313,"rank":84,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":90,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"IT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/UrologyMatch\/statuses\/821179371557941249","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15530009],"posted_on":"2017-01-17T02:16:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Urology Match","url":"http:\/\/www.urologymatch.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/670243589750935552\/vkJCRb_7_normal.jpg","description":"Premier Internet portal to keep abreast of the exciting field of Urology.
