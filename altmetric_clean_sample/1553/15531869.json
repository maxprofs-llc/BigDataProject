Here we analyze the Euclidean version of the problem, i.e., the optimal matching problem between points randomly distributed on a d-dimensional Euclidean space, where the cost to minimize depends on the points' pairwise distances. Using Mayer's cluster expansion we write a formal expression for the replicated action that is suitable for a saddle point computation. We give the diagrammatic rules for each term of the expansion, and we analyze in detail the one-loop diagrams. A characteristic feature of the theory, when diagrams are perturbatively computed around the mean field part of the action, is the vanishing of the mass at zero momentum. In the non-Euclidean case of uncorrelated costs instead, we predict and numerically verify an anomalous scaling for the sub-sub-leading correction to the asymptotic average cost.","authors":["Carlo Lucibello","Giorgio Parisi","Gabriele Sicuro"],"doi":"10.1103\/physreve.95.012302","first_seen_on":"2017-01-17T05:53:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2470-0045","2470-0053"],"issue":"1","journal":"Physical Review E","last_mentioned_on":1493962770,"links":["http:\/\/journals.aps.org\/pre\/abstract\/10.1103\/PhysRevE.95.012302","https:\/\/journals.aps.org\/pre\/abstract\/10.1103\/PhysRevE.95.012302"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.aps.org\/pdf\/10.1103\/PhysRevE.95.012302","pmid":"28208325","pubdate":"2017-01-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Physical Society","title":"One-loop diagrams in the random Euclidean matching problem","type":"article","volume":"95","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/oneloop-diagrams-random-euclidean-matching-problem"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
