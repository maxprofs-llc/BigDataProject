Methods: The clinical data of 200 cases with adult-onset primary hypoparathyroidism in Peking Union Medical College Hospital during December 1987 to December 2015 were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Among them, 128 cases were followed up for a median period of 3 years. Results: The major manifestations at their first visits were tetany and numbness in the distal extremities(81.5%, 163\/200 and 62.0%, 124\/200). Thirty-two percent of the cases (62 cases) had history of seizures, and 60.9%(98\/161) and 74.4%(96\/129) of them were with intracerebral calcifications and cataracts, respectively.Most of subjects(155\/200)had more than one year delay in diagnosis. Hypercalciuria occurred in 67.2%(86\/128) of the cases during the follow-up. No significant differences in the clinical characteristics and biochemical markers between the hypercalciuria subjects and the non-hypercalciuria subjects. Renal nephrocalcinosis or stones were found in 6.5%(5\/77) of the cases, and kidney function decreased in 6.6%(6\/91) of the patients. Kidney function was negatively associated with age and duration of disease. Conclusions: The predominant manifestations of primary hypoparathyroidism in adults included tetany and numbness in the distal extremities and seizures. It is often misdiagnosed. Calcium supplement combined with vitamin D or its metabolites effectively relieve clinical symptoms and signs. The serum and urinary calcium levels should be monitored frequently to reduce renal complications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9233cf058f61000da92","authors":["Quan, T T","Li, Y P","Wang, O","Jiang, Y","Xia, W B","Li, M","Cheng, X Q","Meng, X W","Xing, X P"],"first_seen_on":"2017-01-17T08:23:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0578-1426"],"issue":"1","journal":"Zhonghua nei ke za zhi [Chinese journal of internal medicine]","last_mentioned_on":1484641425,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28056318"],"pmid":"28056318","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["internalmedicine"],"title":"[Clinical characteristics of adult-onset primary hypoparathyroidism: a retrospective analysis of 200 cases].","type":"article","volume":"56"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8078414,"mean":6.8578859978971,"rank":6993282,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8078414,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257826,"mean":12.858943539222,"rank":212982,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257826,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116,"mean":1.0645391304348,"rank":70,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"NL":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Osteoporosis_NL\/statuses\/821271780992106497","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15533781],"posted_on":"2017-01-17T08:23:45+00:00","author":{"name":"Osteoporosis NL","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2728406935\/efab446976f8d9558a2dd15208f7a5a6_normal.jpeg","description":"For public & professionals scientific news about osteoporosis and calcium & bone metabolism by Coen Netelenbos","id_on_source":"Osteoporosis_NL","tweeter_id":"213788861","geo":{"lt":52.5,"ln":5.75,"country":"NL"},"followers":1564},"tweet_id":"821271780992106497"}]}}
