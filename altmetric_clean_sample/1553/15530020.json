However, over decades little has been fundamentally understood regarding how the intramolecular conformation of biphenyl dynamically affects its transport properties at the single-molecule level. Here, we establish the stereoelectronic effect of biphenyl on its electrical conductance based on the platform of graphene-molecule single-molecule junctions, where a specifically-designed hexaphenyl aromatic chain molecule is covalently sandwiched between nanogapped graphene point contacts to create stable single-molecule junctions. Both theoretical and temperature-dependent experimental results consistently demonstrate that phenyl twisting in the aromatic chain molecule produces different microstates with different degrees of conjugation, thus leading to stochastic switching between high- and low-conductance states. These investigations offer new molecular design insights into building functional single-molecule electrical devices.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003145","authors":["Na Xin","Jinying Wang","Chuancheng Jia","Zitong Liu","Xisha Zhang","Chenmin Yu","Mingliang Li","Shuopei Wang","Yao Gong","Hantao Sun","Guanxin Zhang","Zhirong Liu","Guangyu Zhang","Jianhui Liao","Deqing Zhang","Xuefeng Guo"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.nanolett.6b04139","first_seen_on":"2017-01-17T02:17:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1530-6992","1530-6984"],"journal":"Nano Letters","last_mentioned_on":1484732174,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.nanolett.6b04139"],"pmid":"28071918","pubdate":"2017-01-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Stereoelectronic Effect-Induced Conductance Switching in Aromatic Chain Single-Molecule Junctions","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/stereoelectronic-effectinduced-conductance-switching-aromatic-chain-singlemolecule-junctions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082727,"mean":6.8629605662661,"rank":3799014,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4104319,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082727,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258119,"mean":12.858957089393,"rank":125321,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":125767,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258119,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4230,"mean":12.3291444786,"rank":2605,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":1524,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4230,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90,"mean":16.707775280899,"rank":57,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
