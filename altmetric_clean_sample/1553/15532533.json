Here we report that limiting the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is sufficient to reduce DNA lesions and delay tumorigenesis in a murine model of BRCA1-deficient breast cancer. We documented a large amount of endogenous estrogen oxidative metabolites in the mammary gland of the model, which induced DNA adducts and apurinic\/apyrimidinic sites associated with DNA double-strand breaks and genomic instability. Repressing estrogen oxidation via antioxidant treatments reduced oxidative DNA lesions and delayed the onset of mammary tumors. Overall our work suggests an answer to the long-standing question of why germline BRCA1 mutations cause tissue-specific tumors, in showing how tissue-specific, ROS-induced DNA lesions create a non-genetic force to promote mammary tumors in BRCA1-deficient mice. Our findings create a rationale for evaluating suitable antioxidant modalities as a chemopreventive strategy for familial breast cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dd4","authors":["Mo Li","Qian Chen","Xiaochun Yu"],"doi":"10.1158\/0008-5472.can-16-2350","endpage":"458","first_seen_on":"2017-01-17T06:56:26+00:00","funders":["nci","nigms"],"issns":["1538-7445"],"issue":"2","journal":"Cancer Research","last_mentioned_on":1484639853,"links":["http:\/\/cancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/77\/2\/448.short?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/cancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/canres\/77\/2\/448.full.pdf","pmid":"27815389","pubdate":"2017-01-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Association for Cancer Research","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"448","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Chemopreventive Effects of ROS Targeting in a Murine Model of BRCA1-Deficient Breast Cancer","type":"article","volume":"77","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chemopreventive-effects-ros-targeting-murine-model-brca1deficient-breast-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8078414,"mean":6.8578859978971,"rank":4038156,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3834545,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8078414,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257826,"mean":12.858938109182,"rank":134970,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":112918,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257826,"percentile":43},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7363,"mean":7.0331157294214,"rank":4614,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":2461,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7363,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":199,"mean":10.208585858586,"rank":113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":199,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TrueDiagnostics\/statuses\/821249615064350720","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15532533],"posted_on":"2017-01-17T06:55:40+00:00","author":{"name":"Jerry Lee","url":"http:\/\/www.truediag.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/567483990097936384\/6uKJglvi_normal.jpeg","description":"We specialize in providing quick & simple quantitative test systems designed for point-of-care monitoring.
