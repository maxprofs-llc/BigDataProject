We hypothesised that swear word generation would be increased with raised emotional arousal. The emotional arousal of 60 participants was manipulated by having them play a first-person shooter video game or, as a control, a golf video game, in a randomised order. A behavioural measure of swearing fluency based on the Controlled Oral Word Association Test was employed. Successful experimental manipulation was indicated by raised State Hostility Questionnaire scores after playing the shooter game. Swearing fluency was significantly greater after playing the shooter game compared with the golf game. Validity of the swearing fluency task was demonstrated via positive correlations with self-reported swearing fluency and daily swearing frequency. In certain instances swearing may represent a form of emotional expression. This finding will inform debates around the acceptability of using taboo language.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e13","authors":["Richard Stephens","Amy Zile"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10936-016-9473-8","first_seen_on":"2017-01-17T11:04:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-6555","0090-6905"],"journal":"Journal of Psycholinguistic Research","last_mentioned_on":1502716229,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10936-016-9473-8","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s10936-016-9473-8","https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10936-016-9473-8"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10936-016-9473-8.pdf","pmid":"28091853","pubdate":"2017-01-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cognitive Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psycholinguistics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychology, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Linguistics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology","Arts and Humanities"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Does Emotional Arousal Influence Swearing Fluency?","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s10936-016-9473-8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/emotional-arousal-influence-swearing-fluency"},"altmetric_score":{"score":127.722,"score_history":{"1y":127.722,"6m":20.5,"3m":10,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":127.722},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372629,"mean":7.0578283965246,"rank":63199,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":8309727,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372629,"percentile":99},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":277139,"mean":12.545491978725,"rank":4782,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":272357,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":277139,"percentile":98},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161,"mean":2.726875,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":160,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.2166666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Ph.
