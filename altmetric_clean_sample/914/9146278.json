Animals were imaged at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post cardiac irradiation using a hybrid PET-MRI system (Biograph mMR, Siemens Healthcare). The imaging protocol was designed to assess changes in cardiac inflammation using (18) F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18) F-FDG) PET tracer. In order to image cardiac inflammation, the normal myocardial uptake of glucose was suppressed prior to the injection of (18) F-FDG. The suppression of glycolysis was achieved through; fasting (16-21 hours prior to the start of imaging) and an intravenous injection of heparin immediately followed by a 20% lipid infusion 20 min prior to the injection of (18) F-FDG. The standard uptake value (SUV) obtained from 17 myocardial regions were used to compare FDG scans. All animals received a simulation CT scan (GE Medical Systems) for radiation treatment planning. Radiation treatment plans were created using the Pinncale3 treatment planning system (Philips Radiation Oncology Systems) and designed to resemble the typical cardiac exposure during left-sided breast cancer radiotherapy. Cardiac irradiations were performed in a single fraction using a TrueBeam linear accelerator (Varian Medical Systems).\nThe delivered dose (mean \u00b1 standard error) to heart, left ventricle, and left anterior descending artery were 1.7\u00b10.1 Gy, 2.7\u00b10.1 Gy, and 5.5\u00b10.3 Gy respectively. At these doses, a significant increase in (18) F-FDG uptake within the entire heart relative to baseline (1.1\u00b10.02 g\/ml) uptake was observed. (18) F-FDG uptake at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post irradiation were 1.8\u00b10.03 g\/ml, 2.4\u00b10.06 g\/ml, and 2.6\u00b10.11 g\/ml respectively.\nLow doses of limited cardiac irradiation show evidence of a persistent global inflammatory response that can be detected using (18) F-FDG PET imaging. This work was supported through the Translational Breast Cancer Studentship award, funded in part by the Breast Cancer Society of Canada. Additional financial support is provided by the London Regional Cancer Program Catalyst Grant and the Thames Valley Veterinary Services.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5023cf058f61000309b","authors":["O El-Sherif","I Xhaferllari","J Sykes","J Butler","J Battista","G Wisenberg","F Prato","S Gaede"],"doi":"10.1118\/1.4957918","first_seen_on":"2016-06-30T21:55:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0094-2405"],"issue":"6","journal":"Medical Physics","last_mentioned_on":1467321126,"links":["http:\/\/scitation.aip.org\/content\/aapm\/journal\/medphys\/43\/6\/10.1118\/1.4957918?TRACK=RSS&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/scitation.aip.org\/content\/aapm\/journal\/medphys\/43\/6\/10.1118\/1.4957918?TRACK=RSS"],"pmid":"28046380","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Association of Physicists in Medicine","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics"],"title":"WE-FG-202-06: The Use of Hybrid PET MRI for Identifying the Presence of Cardiac Inflammation Following External Beam Irradiation","type":"article","volume":"43"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7971101,"mean":6.7313029448827,"rank":1433851,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6529946,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7971101,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260847,"mean":11.544472186654,"rank":62531,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":198070,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260847,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2940,"mean":1.9589091527731,"rank":102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":2837,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2940,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":313,"mean":3.0550641025641,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":295,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":313,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":5,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/aapmHQ\/statuses\/748599966457749504","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9146278],"posted_on":"2016-06-30T19:31:54+00:00","author":{"name":"AAPM HQ","url":"http:\/\/www.aapm.org\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/414133041435394048\/bkyi2OEJ_normal.jpeg","description":"Official Twitter account for the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM).","id_on_source":"aapmHQ","tweeter_id":"34271917","geo":{"lt":38.80484,"ln":-77.04692,"country":"US"},"followers":6149},"tweet_id":"748599966457749504"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Riverside_Rad\/statuses\/748625180189147137","license":"gnip","rt":["aapmHQ"],"citation_ids":[9146278],"posted_on":"2016-06-30T21:12:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Riverside Radiology","url":"http:\/\/www.riversiderad.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/558658200082194432\/v-zVttkN_normal.jpeg","description":"World class diagnostic & interventional radiology interpretation & consultation services across the state of Ohio.","id_on_source":"Riverside_Rad","tweeter_id":"2994344861","geo":{"lt":39.96118,"ln":-82.99879,"country":"US"},"followers":414},"tweet_id":"748625180189147137"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JeffRadiology\/statuses\/748625180084277249","license":"gnip","rt":["aapmHQ"],"citation_ids":[9146278],"posted_on":"2016-06-30T21:12:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Jefferson Radiology","url":"http:\/\/jeffersonradiology.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/793825439659728896\/juBNnAp-_normal.jpg","description":"We strive to provide world class radiological care in a warm, friendly environment.","id_on_source":"JeffRadiology","tweeter_id":"301632031","geo":{"lt":41.66704,"ln":-72.66648,"country":"US"},"followers":1307},"tweet_id":"748625180084277249"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/StrategicRad\/statuses\/748625180289863685","license":"gnip","rt":["aapmHQ"],"citation_ids":[9146278],"posted_on":"2016-06-30T21:12:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Strategic Radiology","url":"http:\/\/strategicradiology.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/706870749328498688\/EaV3sxN0_normal.jpg","description":"Forward thinking.
