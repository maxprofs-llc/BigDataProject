We evaluated associations between 25-hydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, and hemoglobin A1c levels after adjusting for other covariates, including log transformed 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and log transformed parathyroid hormone levels, in Korean patients with type 2 diabetes. In total, 1,175 patients with type 2 diabetes were selected from 8,857 individuals who completed the baseline survey of the Dong-gu study, conducted in Korea from 2007 to 2010. After adjusting for other covariates, we found that the mean hemoglobin A1c level was inversely associated with the 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (Q1: 7.47% [7.30-7.63], Q2: 7.25% [7.09-7.40], Q3: 7.17% [7.02-7.32], Q4: 7.19% [7.02-7.35]; p for trend = 0.021, p for between groups = 0.050) and the parathyroid hormone level (Q1: 7.35% [7.19-7.51], Q2: 7.34% [7.19-7.50], Q3: 7.28% [7.13-7.43], Q4: 7.09% [6.94-7.24]; p for trend = 0.022, p for between groups = 0.048). However, the mean fasting glucose level was not associated with either the 25-hydroxyvitamin D or parathyroid hormone level. In conclusion, inverse associations were evident between hemoglobin A1c, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and parathyroid hormone levels in Korean patients with type 2 diabetes. The associations remained significant after adjusting for other covariates, including the log transformed 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and log transformed parathyroid hormone levels.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Seong-Woo Choi","Sun-Seog Kweon","Young-Hoon Lee","So-Yeon Ryu","Jin-Su Choi","Jung-Ae Rhee","Hae-Sung Nam","Seul-Ki Jeong","Kyeong-Soo Park","Hee Nam Kim","Min-Ho Shin"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0158764","first_seen_on":"2016-06-30T19:47:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"6","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1467308714,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0158764","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0158764"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0158764.PDF","pmcid":"PMC4928954","pmid":"27362844","pubdate":"2016-06-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0158764","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"25-Hydroxyvitamin D and Parathyroid Hormone Levels Are Independently Associated with the Hemoglobin A 1c Level of Korean Type 2 Diabetic Patients: The Dong-Gu Study","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/25hydroxyvitamin-d-parathyroid-hormone-levels-independently-associated-hemoglobin-a1c-level-korean-t"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7971101,"mean":6.7313029448827,"rank":3953654,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3814040,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7971101,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260847,"mean":11.544440367113,"rank":129915,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":120343,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260847,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111985,"mean":10.341981943849,"rank":58800,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":47741,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111985,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4515,"mean":11.567976074435,"rank":2507,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":1706,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4515,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"reddit":[{"title":"25-Hydroxyvitamin D and Parathyroid Hormone Levels Are Independently Associated with the Hemoglobin A1c Level of Korean Type 2 Diabetic Patients: The Dong-Gu Study","url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/citral\/comments\/4qmyfg\/25hydroxyvitamin_d_and_parathyroid_hormone_levels\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[9144552],"posted_on":"2016-06-30T17:43:17+00:00","author":{"name":"officialcitral","url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/citral","image":"http:\/\/a.thumbs.redditmedia.com\/gq9561mrzeY9TrVx.png","id_on_source":"citral","followers":21,"subreddit":"Centre for Investigative Research and Learning"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TestAllPLoSRSS\/statuses\/748573119879622656","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9144552],"posted_on":"2016-06-30T17:45:14+00:00","author":{"name":"TestAllPLoSRSS","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_0_normal.png","id_on_source":"TestAllPLoSRSS","tweeter_id":"39325734","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":29},"tweet_id":"748573119879622656"}]}}
