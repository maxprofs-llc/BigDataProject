Standard Giemsa staining, C-banding, NOR banding, fluorochromes CMA3\/DAPI, Hsc-FA technique and Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) using 18S rDNA probe were conducted on a population from Aracruz, state of Esp\u00edrito Santo, Brazil, allowing for comparisons with data available on Atta and other fungus-growing ant species. The diploid chromosome number observed for A.\u00a0robusta was 2n=22, and the karyotypic formula was 18m+2sm+2st. Heterochromatic blocks were observed in the centromeric region of most chromosomes, where one pair of metacentric chromosomes is characterized by a GC-rich heterochromatic band in the interstitial region of its long arm. The detection of 18S rDNA using FISH confirmed the presence of single NOR for A.\u00a0robusta. This is the first report of rDNA 18S detection using FISH for leafcutter ants. The cytogenetic results of this study confirm the information available for Atta and allow us to confirm the conserved chromosome number, morphology and banding pattern within the genus for the taxa studied to date, which included species from three out of the four groups of Atta indicated by molecular data. The accumulation of cytogenetic data on fungus-growing ants enhances the understanding of the genomic evolutionary patterns of Atta, since it belongs to a group of recent origin between the most well studied ants. Cytogenetic data does not indicate restrictions in relocation or reintroduction in areas where populations were extinct due to the conserved karyotype. This study allows for cytogenetic comparison of A.\u00a0robusta with other ants of Atta, emphasizing the importance of chromosomal information for species conservation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100025c3","authors":["Barros, Lu\u00edsa Ant\u00f4nia Campos","Aguiar, Hilton Jeferson Alves Cardoso de","Teixeira, Gisele Amaro","Mariano, Cl\u00e9a Dos Santos Ferreira","Teixeira, Marcos da Cunha","Delabie, Jacques Hubert Charles","Pompolo, Silvia das Gra\u00e7as","Lu\u00edsa Ant\u00f4nia Campos Barros","Hilton Jeferson Alves Cardoso de Aguiar","Gisele Amaro Teixeira","Cl\u00e9a dos Santos Ferreira Mariano","Marcos da Cunha Teixeira","Jacques Hubert Charles Delabie","Silvia das Gra\u00e7as Pompolo"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.crvi.2015.07.006","endpage":"665","first_seen_on":"2016-06-30T17:52:48+00:00","issns":["1768-3238","16310691"],"issue":"10","journal":"Comptes Rendus Biologies","last_mentioned_on":1499906625,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26315727?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26315727"],"pmid":"26315727","pubdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"660","subjects":["biology"],"title":"Cytogenetic data on the threatened leafcutter ant Atta robusta Borgmeier, 1939 (Formicidae: Myrmicinae: Attini)","type":"article","volume":"338","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cytogenetic-data-threatened-leafcutter-ant-atta-robusta-borgmeier-1939-formicidae-myrmicinae-attini"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8204367,"mean":6.945700472644,"rank":6229756,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1104631,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8204367,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262531,"mean":11.674518630251,"rank":182483,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":45081,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262531,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":288,"mean":5.0694216027875,"rank":202,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":288,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":3.8022857142857,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
