We have developed an explicit, generic MLC sequencing model to serve as a tool for future investigations of fluence map optimization, fluence delivery optimization, and rotational collimator delivery methods.\nWe have developed a novel, comprehensive model to effectively account for a variety of transmission and penumbra effects previously treated on an ad hoc basis in the literature. As the model is capable of quantifying a variety of effects, we utilize the asymmetric leakage intensity across each leaf to deliver fluence maps with pixel size smaller than the narrowest leaf width. Developed using linear programming and mixed integer programming formulations, the model is implemented using state of the art open-source solvers. To demonstrate the versatility of the algorithm, a graphical user interface (GUI) was developed in MATLAB capable of accepting custom leaf specifications and transmission parameters. As a preliminary proof-ofconcept, we have sequenced the leaves of a Varian 120 Leaf Millennium MLC for five prostate cancer patient fields and one head and neck field. Predetermined fluence maps have been processed by data smoothing methods to obtain pixel sizes of 2.5 cm(2) . The quality of output was analyzed using computer simulations.\nFor the prostate fields, an average root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.82 and gamma (0.5mm\/0.5%) of 91.4% were observed compared to RMSE and gamma (0.5mm\/0.5%) values of 7.04 and 34.0% when the leakage considerations were omitted. Similar results were observed for the head and neck case.\nA model to sequence MLC leaves to optimality has been proposed. Future work will involve extensive testing and evaluation of the method on clinical MLCs and comparison with black-box leaf sequencing algorithms currently used by commercial treatment planning systems.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5023cf058f61000309b","authors":["S Weppler","S Weppler","P McGeachy","J Villarreal-Barajas","R Khan"],"doi":"10.1118\/1.4956725","first_seen_on":"2016-06-30T19:26:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0094-2405"],"issue":"6","journal":"Medical Physics","last_mentioned_on":1467307720,"links":["http:\/\/scitation.aip.org\/content\/aapm\/journal\/medphys\/43\/6\/10.1118\/1.4956725?TRACK=RSS"],"pmid":"28048428","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Association of Physicists in Medicine","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics"],"title":"SU-F-T-540: Comprehensive Fluence Delivery Optimization with Multileaf Collimation","type":"article","volume":"43"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7971101,"mean":6.7313029448827,"rank":6042620,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1073157,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7971101,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260847,"mean":11.544433466489,"rank":182930,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":41988,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260847,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2940,"mean":1.9589091527731,"rank":1911,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":652,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2940,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":313,"mean":2.9733333333333,"rank":185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":70,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":313,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/medphyspapers\/statuses\/748568949923659776","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9144261],"posted_on":"2016-06-30T17:28:40+00:00","author":{"name":"Med Phys Papers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","description":"New publications in Medical Physics and Radiotherapy.","id_on_source":"medphyspapers","tweeter_id":"2879791906","geo":{"lt":54.75844,"ln":-2.69531,"country":"GB"},"followers":137},"tweet_id":"748568949923659776"}]}}
