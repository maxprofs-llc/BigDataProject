It has been used to perform both forward and reverse genetics to identify plant genes involved in several plant processes. However, this technology has not yet been used to its full potential. This can be attributed to several of its limitations such as inability to silence genes during seed germination and the non-stable nature of silencing. However, several recent studies have shown that these limitations can now be overcome. In this review, we will discuss the limitations of VIGS and suitable solutions. In addition, we also describe the recent improvements and future prospects of using VIGS in plant biology.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036b5","authors":["Muthappa Senthil-Kumar","Kirankumar S.
