Traditional imaging modalities, such as radiography, echocardiography, and angiography, are inherently limited by the difficulties of a 2-dimensional approach to a 3-dimensional object. We postulated that accurate characterization of malformations of the aorta would benefit from 3-dimensional assessment. Therefore, multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) was chosen as a 3-dimensional, new, and noninvasive imaging technique. The purpose of this study was to evaluate patients with 2 common diseases of the intrathoracic aorta, either patent ductus arteriosus or vascular ring anomaly, by contrast-enhanced 64-row computed tomography.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4cc3cf058f6100004b5","authors":["Christiane R Henjes","Christiane R Henjes","Ingo Nolte","Patrick Wefstaedt"],"doi":"10.1186\/1746-6148-7-57","first_seen_on":"2011-09-23T15:50:06+00:00","issns":["","1746-6148"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Veterinary Research","last_mentioned_on":1318123796,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1746-6148\/7\/57\/abstract","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1746-6148\/7\/57","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1746-6148-7-57.pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1746-6148-7-57.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3186751","pmid":"21943366","pubdate":"2011-09-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"startpage":"57","title":"Multidetector-row computed tomography of thoracic aortic anomalies in dogs and cats: Patent ductus arteriosus and vascular rings","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multidetectorrow-computed-tomography-thoracic-aortic-anomalies-dogs-cats-patent-ductus-arteriosus-va"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4729227,"mean":5.5465942099605,"rank":1907708,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2743665,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4729227,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65481,"mean":4.8562317654245,"rank":20664,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":43043,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65481,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":823,"mean":2.1078442822384,"rank":221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":588,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":823,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.6888888888889,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
