Certain health conditions and impairments have been shown to contribute independently to the risk of falling or experiencing a fall injury, suggesting that individuals with these conditions or impairments should be the focus of falls prevention. Since older people commonly have multiple conditions\/impairments, knowledge about which conditions\/impairments coexist in at-risk individuals would be valuable in the implementation of a targeted prevention approach. The objective of this study was therefore to examine the prevalence and patterns of comorbidity in this population group.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007ba","authors":["Trang Vu","Caroline F Finch","Lesley Day","Vu T","Finch CF","Day L"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2318-11-45","first_seen_on":"2011-09-19T18:20:45+00:00","issns":["1471-2318",""],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Geriatrics","last_mentioned_on":1316464138,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2318\/11\/45"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2318-11-45.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3171714","pmid":"21851627","pubdate":"2011-08-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"45","subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Patterns of comorbidity in community-dwelling older people hospitalised for fall-related injury: A cluster analysis","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2318-11-45","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/patterns-comorbidity-communitydwelling-older-people-hospitalised-fallrelated-injury-cluster-analysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505992,"mean":5.1115236646191,"rank":1994107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2419463,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505992,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64559,"mean":4.5770003407788,"rank":21941,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":40752,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64559,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":493,"mean":3.8128699186992,"rank":293,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":179,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":493,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":2.8691666666667,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
