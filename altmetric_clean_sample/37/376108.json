Moreover, several receptor ligands with differential efficacies toward these distinct signaling pathways have been identified. However, the structural basis and mechanism underlying this 'biased agonism' remains largely unknown. Here, we develop a quantitative mass spectrometry strategy that measures specific reactivities of individual side chains to investigate dynamic conformational changes in the \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptor occupied by nine functionally distinct ligands. Unexpectedly, only a minority of residues showed reactivity patterns consistent with classical agonism, whereas the majority showed distinct patterns of reactivity even between functionally similar ligands. These findings demonstrate, contrary to two-state models for receptor activity, that there is significant variability in receptor conformations induced by different ligands, which has significant implications for the design of new therapeutic agents.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f610004264","authors":["Alem W Kahsai","Kunhong Xiao","Sudarshan Rajagopal","Seungkirl Ahn","Arun K Shukla","Jinpeng Sun","Terrence G Oas","Robert J Lefkowitz","Kahsai AW","Xiao K","Rajagopal S","Ahn S","Shukla AK","Sun J","Oas TG","Lefkowitz RJ"],"doi":"10.1038\/nchembio.634","endpage":"700","first_seen_on":"2011-09-19T21:27:50+00:00","funders":["nigms","nhlbi"],"issns":["1552-4450","1552-4469"],"issue":"10","journal":"Nature Chemical Biology","last_mentioned_on":1367205677,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nchembio\/journal\/v7\/n10\/full\/nchembio.634.html#\/author-information","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21857662"],"pmid":"21857662","pubdate":"2011-08-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"692","subjects":["chemistry","biology"],"title":"Multiple ligand-specific conformations of the \u00ce\u00b22-adrenergic receptor","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/nchembio.634","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multiple-ligandspecific-conformations-%CE%B22adrenergic-receptor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4870132,"mean":5.7973432989817,"rank":1867198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":2963149,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4870132,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65903,"mean":5.014106157628,"rank":19783,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":45298,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65903,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1307,"mean":12.062702909648,"rank":833,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":466,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1307,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":5.9017948717949,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":32,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
