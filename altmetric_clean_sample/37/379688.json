In breast cancer, high levels of TGF-\u03b2 are associated with poor outcome, whereas inhibition of TGF-\u03b2-signaling reduces metastasis. In contrast, BMP-7 inhibits bone metastasis of breast cancer cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024cc","authors":["Hildegonda P. H.
