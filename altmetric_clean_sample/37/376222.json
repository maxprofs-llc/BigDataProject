A soy snack bar with 39.88 g\/100 g dietary fibre, 34.25 g\/100 g protein, 100.39 mg\/100 g isoflavones and 245.47 kcal\/100 g was produced. The shelf life of the product was tested over a period of 6 months. The hardness, water activity and darkness of the snack bars increased with storage time. Clinical trial was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the soy snack bar on the lipid profiles of 22 dyslipidaemic subjects for a period of 45 days. There was a decrease in levels of triglycerides (TGs) (- 20%) and an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) (+8%) comparing with baseline values. Therefore, relatively high intakes of soy protein and isoflavones in moderately hypercholesterolaemic subjects (>200 mg\/dl) may have a moderately beneficial effect on plasma lipid profiles, as TG and HDL-c levels, without additional diet restrictions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e3f","authors":["Luciana Pereira Lobato","Alissana Ester Iakmiu Camargo PEREIRA","Marcela Marta Lazaretti","D\u00e9cio Sabattini Barbosa","Clisia Mara Carreira","Jos\u00e9 Marcos Gontijo Mandarino","Maria Victoria Eiras Grossmann"],"doi":"10.3109\/09637486.2011.596148","first_seen_on":"2011-09-20T01:09:01+00:00","issns":["0963-7486","1465-3478"],"journal":"International Journal of Food Sciences & Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1328036574,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/09637486.2011.596148"],"pmid":"21728920","pubdate":"2011-07-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"110706030501006","subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Snack bars with high soy protein and isoflavone content for use in diets to control dyslipidaemia.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/snack-bars-high-soy-protein-isoflavone-content-diets-control-dyslipidaemia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506762,"mean":5.1233691071599,"rank":1651701,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2823279,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506762,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64446,"mean":4.6617334781596,"rank":17867,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":46005,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64446,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":432,"mean":3.0636844547564,"rank":130,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":301,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":432,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":1.5216129032258,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
