The as-prepared ZnO\/SiO(2) core\/shell particles were coated on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) textiles, followed by hydrophobization with hexadecyltrimethoxysilane, to fabricate superhydrophobic surfaces with UV-shielding properties. Transmission electron microscopy and \u03b6 potential analysis were employed to evidence the fabrication of ZnO\/SiO(2) core\/shell particles. Scanning electron microscopy and thermal gravimetric analysis were conducted to investigate the surface morphologies of the textile and the coating of the fibers. Ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry and contact angle measurement indicated that the incorporation of ZnO onto fibers imparted UV-blocking properties to the textile surface, while the coating of SiO(2) shell on ZnO prohibited the photocatalytic degradation of hexadecyltrimethoxysilane by ZnO, making the as-treated PET textile surface show stable superhydrophobicity with good UV-shielding properties.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2011Nanot..22O5603X","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003146","authors":["Xue, Chao-Hua","Yin, Wei","Jia, Shun-Tian","Ma, Jian-Zhong","Chao-Hua Xue","Wei Yin","Shun-Tian Jia","Jian-Zhong Ma"],"doi":"10.1088\/0957-4484\/22\/41\/415603","first_seen_on":"2011-09-21T15:37:13+00:00","issns":["0957-4484","1361-6528"],"issue":"41","journal":"Nanotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1316619013,"links":["http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/0957-4484\/22\/41\/415603"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/0957-4484\/22\/41\/415603\/pdf\/0957-4484_22_41_415603.pdf","pmid":"21914937","pubdate":"2011-10-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"IOP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"415603","subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"UV-durable superhydrophobic textiles with UV-shielding properties by coating fibers with ZnO\/SiO2 core\/shell particles","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/uvdurable-superhydrophobic-textiles-uvshielding-properties-coating-fibers-znosio-sub2sub-coreshell-p"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":3557993,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":831004,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66685,"mean":5.0879937316298,"rank":45099,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":9835,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66685,"percentile":14},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1099,"mean":5.444985428051,"rank":756,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1099,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":5.7167164179104,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
