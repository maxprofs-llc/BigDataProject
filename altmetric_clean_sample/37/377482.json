Provision of contraception has been demonstrated to be a particularly cost-effective healthcare intervention as, besides preventing a significant number of unintended pregnancies, it also results in great cost-savings to society. Male and female sterilization and long-acting reversible methods (such as the copper-T intra-uterine device and the subdermal implant) constitute the most cost-effective contraceptive options, followed by other hormonal methods (such as oral contraceptives); barrier and behavioural methods (such as the male condom and withdrawal, respectively) are least cost-effective compared with other contraceptive options. Nevertheless, when compared with no method, they still prevent a large number of unintended pregnancies, thus leading to important cost-savings. Improvements in compliance and continuation rates are expected to further enhance the contraceptive benefits and cost-savings associated with contraceptive use.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c11","authors":["Mavranezouli I","Ifigeneia Mavranezouli"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bpobgyn.2008.11.007","endpage":"198","first_seen_on":"2011-09-21T04:04:31+00:00","issns":["1532-1932","1521-6934","15216934"],"issue":"2","journal":"Best Practice & Research Clinical Obstetrics & Gynaecology","last_mentioned_on":1316605567,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19147410"],"pmid":"19147410","pubdate":"2009-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"187","subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Health economics of contraception.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1521693408001570","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/health-economics-contraception"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8085298,"mean":6.8673445643291,"rank":3797037,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4108536,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8085298,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80155,"mean":5.7770108790578,"rank":35635,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":42153,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80155,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":322,"mean":4.0430529595016,"rank":153,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":164,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":322,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":3,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
