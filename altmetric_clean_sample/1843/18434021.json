The demographic characteristics and vital signs of the patients were recorded. Prior to taking blood samples, the transcutaneous Hb level, heart rate, oxygen saturation (SO2 ), and perfusion index (PI) were measured using a probe connected to thesubject'sthumb. To determine the reliability of the transcutaneous measurements versus venous blood measurements performed via an autoanalyzerdevice, theinterclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated. The correlation between the results of both measurements was evaluated by Bland-Altman analysis.\nIn the study, 59.4% of the patients were boys. The average age was 53\u2009months (range, 6-132). The average body weight was 16\u2009kg (range, 10-25\u2009kg). The mean venous Hb level, hematocrit level, and transcutaneous Hb level were11.94\u2009\u00b1\u20091.15\u2009g\/dL, 35.8%\u2009\u00b1\u20093.2, and 12.42\u2009\u00b1\u20091.24\u2009g\/dL, respectively. The ICC for the reliability of the transcutaneous measurements versusvenous blood measurements was r\u2009=\u20090.67 (95% CI\u2009=\u20090.5776-0.7526). The correlation between the twosets of measurements was good, as evaluated by the Bland-Altman analysis.\nThe results point to a good correlation between transcutaneous and venous blood measurements of the Hb level. In the future, transcutaneous measurements, as non-invasive method, may be an alternative method for the detection of Hb levels in childhood. This article is protected by copyright.
