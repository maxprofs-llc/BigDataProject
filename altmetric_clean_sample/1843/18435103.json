Despite cultural association of this apparel, it is part of numerous injury episodes of varying enormity. Entanglement of loose scarf in spoke wheels of bike, tricycle, belt driven machines like sugarcane juice machine, thresher, grinding machines, etc is observed both in social and industrial milieu. This study aims to investigate the scarf-related injuries at a major trauma center in northern India.\nFrom June 2013 to May 2015, a hospital-based prospective observational study was done in patients who presented to a level 1 trauma center in northern India with the mode of injury involving scarf around the neck. Demographic profile, mode of trauma, contributing factors, injury pattern, and the early management as well as early complications were recorded.\nThere were 76 injuries directly related from scarf with the mean age of patients being 32.4 years. The most common primary factor involved was rotating wheel of motorbike\/tricycle (46.1%), followed by belt driven machines (28.9%). The spectrum of injuries was diverse, including minor abrasions or lacerations (53.9%), large lacerations (15.8%), fractures and spine trauma (18.4%), mangled extremity and amputations (7.9%) and death (3.9%). More severe injury patterns were noted with belt driven machines.\nScarf-related injuries constitute a sizable proportion of trauma, with varying degrees of severity. Devastating consequences in significant proportion of cases dictate the call for a prevention plan comprising both educational and legislative measures. Urgent preventive measures targeting scarf-related injuries will help reduce mortality and morbidity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e9a","authors":["Pritish Singh","Ashok Kumar","Vishal Shekhawat"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cjtee.2016.03.009","first_seen_on":"2017-04-02T16:20:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["10081275"],"journal":"Chinese Journal of Traumatology","last_mentioned_on":1491004800,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28336419"],"pmid":"28336419","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Scarf-related injuries at a major trauma center in northern India","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/scarfrelated-injuries-major-trauma-center-northern-india"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8440126,"mean":7.0979478654558,"rank":7293020,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8440126,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249680,"mean":13.14991828708,"rank":206462,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249680,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":3.5161111111111,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":3.16,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Timeline Photos","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=10155171103598252&id=191900433251","license":"public","citation_ids":[18435103],"posted_on":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","summary":"Are you a fan of wearing a scarf?
