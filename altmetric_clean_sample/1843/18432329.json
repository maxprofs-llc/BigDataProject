Laboratory analysis agreed with clinical impression in only 17.4% of cases. Age and sex correlated with the detection of specific drugs. But for benzodiazepines, no consistent temporal pattern was present regarding either type or number of drugs detected. Certain days of the week demonstrated a statistically significant effect upon the number of toxicology requests received, while seasons, holidays, and lunar phases had no influence. Inappropriate requests comprised 9% of the total annual toxicology caseload.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9183cf058f61000d236","authors":["Schwartz, J G","Stuckey, J H","Prihoda, T J","Kazen, C M","Carnahan, J J"],"first_seen_on":"2017-04-02T13:35:13+00:00","issns":["0040-4470"],"issue":"6","journal":"Texas medicine","last_mentioned_on":1491114524,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2371700?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"2371700","pubdate":"1990-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Hospital-based toxicology: patterns of use and abuse.","type":"article","volume":"86","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hospitalbased-toxicology-patterns-abuse"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451184,"mean":7.1040239874029,"rank":7302221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451184,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250144,"mean":13.148222056983,"rank":206877,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250144,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":10.407450980392,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"video":[{"title":"Luna e Fasi Lunari Non Influenzano Agricoltura | AstroCaffe Ep.92","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=haCLYiVqzsY","image":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/haCLYiVqzsY\/hqdefault.jpg","license":"public","citation_ids":[3218772,18432322,3859135,12955847,18432323,3000979,8738539,18432325,1770173,18432326,18432329],"posted_on":"2017-04-02T06:28:44+00:00","summary":"Secondo secoli di tradizione popolare, la Luna e le fasi lunari sono fondamentali per determinare quando inseminare, o raccogliere o preparare il vino o persino cose di vita quotidiana come tagliarsi i capelli o le unghie o avere bambini. \nMa c'\u00e8 una base","embed":{"type":"youtube","youtube_id":"haCLYiVqzsY"},"author":{"name":"link4universe","id_on_source":"UCHRTziAevLPgAE9Y5VhSs5g"}}]}}
