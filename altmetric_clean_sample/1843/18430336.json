This problem is connected not only with morbidity, but also with treatment, specifically with the effectiveness of the therapy as well as the concomitant side effects of available antidepressants. Major depressive disorder is a complex clinical entity, including different molecular mechanisms and neurological processes. This complexity is a challenge for scientists seeking to discover an innovatory antidepressant drug with multiple and complementary mechanisms of action. In this review, we discuss the role of melatonin, neurokinin, neurotrophic tyrosine kinase and glucocorticoid receptors in depression and antidepressant-like effects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f6100084db","authors":["Karolina Pytka","Katarzyna M\u0142yniec","Karolina Podkowa","Adrian Podkowa","Magdalena Jakubczyk","El\u017cbieta \u017bmudzka","Klaudia Lustyk","Jacek Sapa","Barbara Filipek"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pharep.2017.01.026","first_seen_on":"2017-04-02T11:40:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["17341140","1734-1140"],"issue":"3","journal":"Pharmacological Reports","last_mentioned_on":1491133215,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28364694?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28364694","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"The role of melatonin, neurokinin, neurotrophic tyrosine kinase and glucocorticoid receptors in antidepressant-like effect","type":"article","volume":"69","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-melatonin-neurokinin-neurotrophic-tyrosine-kinase-glucocorticoid-receptors-antidepressantlike-e"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451184,"mean":7.1040239874029,"rank":7302241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451184,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250144,"mean":13.148218658927,"rank":206892,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250144,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":434,"mean":1.890143187067,"rank":286,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":434,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":2.0222222222222,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
