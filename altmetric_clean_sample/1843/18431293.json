For clinical diagnosis, it is hoped that the MGMT expression level could be determined by a noninvasive method to understand the detailed biological properties of MGMT-specific tumors. We synthesized (11)C-labeled O(6)-[(3-methyl)benzyl]guanine ([(11)C]mMeBG) as a positron emission tomography probe. Thus, a mixed amine-protected stannyl precursor, N(9)-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-O(6)-[3-(tributylstannyl)benzyl]-N(2)-(trifluoroacetyl)guanine, was subjected to rapid C-[(11)C]methylation under [(11)C]CH3I\/[Pd2(dba)3]\/P(o-CH3C6H4)3\/CuCl\/K2CO3 in NMP, followed by quick deprotection with LiOH\/H2O, giving [(11)C]mMeBG with total radioactivity of 1.34GBq and \u226599% radiochemical and chemical purities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f2","authors":["Hiroko Koyama","Hiroshi Ikenuma","Hiroshi Toda","Goro Kondo","Masaki Hirano","Masaya Kato","Junichiro Abe","Takashi Yamada","Toshihiko Wakabayashi","Kengo Ito","Atsushi Natsume","Masaaki Suzuki"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bmcl.2017.03.045","first_seen_on":"2017-04-02T12:56:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0960894X","1464-3405"],"journal":"Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters","last_mentioned_on":1491137769,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28363750?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28363750","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"title":"Synthesis of PET probe O 6 -[(3-[ 11 C]methyl)benzyl]guanine by Pd 0 -mediated rapid C -[ 11 C]methylation toward imaging DNA repair protein O 6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase in glioblastoma","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-pet-probe-o6311cmethylbenzylguanine-pd0mediated-rapid-c11cmethylation-toward-imaging-dna-r"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451184,"mean":7.1040239874029,"rank":7302241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451184,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250143,"mean":13.148263226487,"rank":206892,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250143,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2160,"mean":2.5517415470125,"rank":1612,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2160,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":1.4715,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
