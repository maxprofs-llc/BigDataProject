Here we report the isolation and complete genome sequence of the thermophilic starch-degrading Geobacillus sp. 12AMOR1. The strain 12AMOR1 was isolated from deep-sea hot sediment at the Jan Mayen hydrothermal Vent Site. Geobacillus sp. 12AMOR1 consists of a 3,410,035 bp circular chromosome and a 32,689 bp plasmid with a G\u2009+\u2009C content of 52 % and 47 %, respectively. The genome comprises 3323 protein-coding genes, 88 tRNA species and 10 rRNA operons. The isolate grows on a suite of sugars, complex polysaccharides and proteinous carbon sources. Accordingly, a versatility of genes encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy) and peptidases were identified in the genome. Expression, purification and characterization of an enzyme of the glycoside hydrolase family 13 revealed a starch-degrading capacity and high thermal stability with a melting temperature of 76.4 \u00b0C. Altogether, the data obtained point to a new isolate from a marine hydrothermal vent with a large bioprospecting potential.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc83","authors":["Juliane Wissuwa","Juliane Wissuwa","Runar Stokke","Anita-Elin Fed\u00f8y","Kjersti Lian","Arne Oskar Smal\u00e5s","Ida Helene Steen"],"doi":"10.1186\/s40793-016-0137-y","first_seen_on":"2016-10-30T13:57:35+00:00","issns":["1944-3277"],"issue":"1","journal":"Standards in Genomic Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1477835841,"links":["http:\/\/standardsingenomics.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s40793-016-0137-y"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/standardsingenomics.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s40793-016-0137-y?site=standardsingenomics.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"26913091","pubdate":"2016-02-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Genetics & Genomics","scheme":"springer"}],"startpage":"16","title":"Isolation and complete genome sequence of the thermophilic Geobacillus sp. 12AMOR1 from an Arctic deep-sea hydrothermal vent site","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/isolation-complete-genome-sequence-thermophilic-geobacillus-sp-12amor1-arctic-deepsea-hydrothermal-v"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7621460,"mean":6.5607387299425,"rank":3941952,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2137896,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7621460,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234317,"mean":12.737190776558,"rank":128403,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":83656,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234317,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":422,"mean":2.0334489311164,"rank":178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":194,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":422,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":2.59,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
