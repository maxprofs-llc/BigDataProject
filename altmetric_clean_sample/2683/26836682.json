Linezolid resistance can be mutational (23S rRNA or L-protein) or, less commonly, acquired [predominantly cfr , conferring resistance to phenicols, lincosamides, oxazolidinones, pleuromutilins and streptogramin A compounds (PhLOPS A ) or optrA , encoding oxazolidinone and phenicol resistance].\nTo investigate the clonality and genetic basis of linezolid resistance in 13 linezolid-resistant (LZDR) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) isolates recovered during a 2013\/14 outbreak in an ICU in an Irish hospital and an LZDR vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) isolate from an LZDR-MRSE-positive patient.\nAll isolates underwent PhLOPS A susceptibility testing, 23S rRNA sequencing, DNA microarray profiling and WGS.\nAll isolates exhibited the PhLOPS A phenotype. The VRE harboured cfr and optrA on a novel 73\u2009kb plasmid (pEF12-0805) also encoding erm (A), erm (B), lnu (B), lnu (E), aphA3 and aadE . One MRSE (M13\/0451, from the same patient as the VRE) harboured cfr on a novel 8.5\u2009kb plasmid (pSEM13-0451). The remaining 12 MRSE lacked cfr but exhibited linezolid resistance-associated mutations and were closely related to (1-52 SNPs) but distinct from M13\/0451 (202-223 SNPs).\nUsing WGS, novel and distinct cfr and cfr \/ optrA plasmids were identified in an MRSE and VRE isolate, respectively, as well as a cfr -negative LZDR-MRSE ICU outbreak and a distinct cfr -positive LZDR-MRSE from the same ICU. To our knowledge, this is the first report of cfr and optrA on a single VRE plasmid. Ongoing surveillance of linezolid resistance is essential to maintain its therapeutic efficacy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c89","authors":["Alexandros Lazaris","David C.
