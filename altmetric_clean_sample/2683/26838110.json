BrdU was used as a lineage tracer to label proliferating neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) on BrdU indicated that the total number of BrdU positive (+) cells was increased in NCT cKO mice. IHC on doublecortin (DCX) showed that the total number of DCX+ cells was also increased in NCT cKO mice. NCT cKO mice displayed significant astrogliosis as well. However, NCT cKO mice at 3\u00a0months did not show significant neuronal death or synaptic loss.\nNCT-dependent \u03b3-secretase activity plays an important role in cell proliferation and immature neuron generation. Enhanced neurogenesis and astrogliosis may be early cellular events prior to the occurrence of neuronal death in neurodegenerative disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5213cf058f610003aa9","authors":["Ting-Ting Liu","Xiao-Lian Ye","Jin-Ping Zhang","Ting-Ting Yu","Shan-Shan Cheng","Xiao-Chuan Zou","Yun Xu","Gui-Quan Chen","Zhen-Yu Yin"],"doi":"10.1111\/cns.12763","first_seen_on":"2017-09-30T10:45:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["17555930","1755-5949"],"journal":"CNS Neuroscience & Therapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1506768305,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28960838?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28960838","pubdate":"2017-09-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Increased adult neurogenesis associated with reactive astrocytosis occurs prior to neuron loss in a mouse model of neurodegenerative disease","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0.25,"6d":0.25,"5d":0.25,"4d":0.25,"3d":0.25,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462498,"mean":7.1083922572655,"rank":7311948,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462498,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109269,"mean":11.341046802358,"rank":88640,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109269,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":499,"mean":6.885124497992,"rank":359,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":499,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":9.6875,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SynapsePapers\/statuses\/914078641083969536","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26838110],"posted_on":"2017-09-30T10:45:05+00:00","author":{"name":"SynapsePapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/566055028952018944\/nOqlF7Cg_normal.png","description":"Twitterbot bringing you new papers on neuronal synapses.
