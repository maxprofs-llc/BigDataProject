It has been shown that lysine residues play a key role in the formation of these aggregates. Thus the ability to disrupt aggregate formation by covalently modifying lysine residues could lead to the discovery of therapeutically relevant anti-amyloidogenesis compounds. Herein, we demonstrate that an ortho-iminoquinone (IQ) can be utilized to inhibit amyloid aggregation. Using alpha-synuclein and A\u03b21-40 as model systems, we observed that IQ was able to react with lysine residues and reduce amyloid aggregation. We also observed that IQ reacts with free amines within the amyloid fibrils preventing their dissociation and seeding capacity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006812","authors":["Luiza Fernandes","Nath\u00e1lia Moraes","Fernanda Savacini Sagrillo","Augusto V.
