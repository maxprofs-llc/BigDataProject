However, it is unclear whether these memory-related transcription factors actually interact in the native environment in neurons. To clarify this question, we have developed an Aplysia two-hybrid system and found, consistent with previous studies that ApCREB2 interacts with ApCREB1a and ApC\/EBP, and that ApC\/EBP forms homodimers. We have also found that ApCREB1a and ApC\/EBP do not interact. Therefore, our study shows that formerly described interactions between the proteins actually occur in the Aplysia neurons and that interactions between these transcription factors are specific.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610008013","authors":["Jung-Hwan Choi","Jin-A Lee","Seok-Won Yim","Chae-Seok Lim","Chi-Hoon Lee","Young-Don Lee","Dusan Bartsch","Eric R.
