It can occur in all production stages; thus, it is essential to perform a detailed analysis for protein aggregates. Several methods such as size exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC), light scattering, turbidity, light obscuration, and microscopy-based approaches are used to analyze aggregates. None of these methods allows determination of all types of higher molecular weight (HMW) species due to a limited size range. Furthermore, quantification and specification of different HMW species are often not possible. Moreover, automation is a perspective challenge coming up with automated robotic laboratory systems. Hence, there is a need for a fast, high-throughput-compatible method, which can detect a broad size range and enable quantification and classification. We describe a novel approach for the detection of aggregates in the size range 1 to 1000\u00a0\u03bcm combining fluorescent dyes for protein aggregate labelling and automated fluorescence microscope imaging (aFMI). After appropriate selection of the dye and method optimization, our method enabled us to detect various types of HMW species of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Using 10\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L(-1) 4,4'-dianilino-1,1'-binaphthyl-5,5'-disulfonate (Bis-ANS) in combination with aFMI allowed the analysis of mAb aggregates induced by different stresses occurring during downstream processing, storage, and administration. Validation of our results was performed by SE-HPLC, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering. With this new approach, we could not only reliably detect different HMW species but also quantify and classify them in an automated approach. Our method achieves high-throughput requirements and the selection of various fluorescent dyes enables a broad range of applications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224a","authors":["Albert Jesuran Paul","Fabian Bickel","Martina R\u00f6hm","Lisa Hospach","Bettina Halder","Nina Rettich","Ren\u00e9 Handrick","Eva Maria Herold","Hans Kiefer","Friedemann Hesse"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00216-017-0362-2","first_seen_on":"2017-06-16T11:32:41+00:00","issns":["1618-2642","1618-2650"],"journal":"Analytical & Bioanalytical Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1497614207,"links":["https:\/\/link.springer.com\/epdf\/10.1007\/s00216-017-0362-2?shared_access_token=b8Ncom6meh9uMp1jLfaI9fe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY58TpQdACihwMkcwYmSsf4gZL3V528lDQwX7nmRJDp9BLZWEAhQR1-elZNCwa0jb8HFOiSygdhlnu4jQv4aAIdmplFFl6JYu1pNBzaVJF9cMdaYPExW86I43hwmiMXGgEw%3D"],"pmid":"28447132","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Characterization and Evaluation of Materials","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Food Science","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Laboratory Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Monitoring\/Environmental Analysis","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"High-throughput analysis of sub-visible mAb aggregate particles using automated fluorescence microscopy imaging","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highthroughput-analysis-subvisible-mab-aggregate-particles-using-automated-fluorescence-microscopy-i"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8380241,"mean":7.0622268827546,"rank":6060307,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2020302,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8380241,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":219741,"mean":13.128548921452,"rank":143541,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":62830,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":219741,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2710,"mean":2.0180295311923,"rank":1220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":1350,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2710,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":1.1886666666667,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
