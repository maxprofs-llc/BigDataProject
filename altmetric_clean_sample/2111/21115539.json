In particular, this pathway has been implicated in cell fate determination, proliferation and cell polarity establishment. In the brain, it contributes to synapse formation, axonal remodeling, dendrite outgrowth, synaptic activity, neurogenesis and behavioral plasticity. The expression and distribution of Wnt components in different organs vary with age, which may have important implications for preserving tissue homeostasis. The dysregulation of Wnt signaling has been implicated in age-associated diseases, such as cancer and some neurodegenerative conditions. This is a relevant research topic, as an important research avenue for therapeutic targeting of the Wnt pathway in regenerative medicine has recently been opened. In this review, we discuss the recent findings on the regulation of Wnt components during aging, particularly in brain functioning, and the implications of Wnt signaling in age-related diseases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f6100021a8","authors":["Garc\u00eda-Vel\u00e1zquez, Lizbeth","Arias, Clorinda"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.arr.2017.06.001","first_seen_on":"2017-06-16T12:02:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1568-1637","1872-9649"],"journal":"Ageing Research Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1497867964,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S1568163717300909&_version=1&md5=4ae0d99272280712b573d35e1bb49c1b","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28624530?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28624530","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"The emerging role of Wnt signaling dysregulation in the understanding and modification of age-associated diseases","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/emerging-role-wnt-signaling-dysregulation-understanding-modification-ageassociated-diseases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8392157,"mean":7.0686031077041,"rank":4479998,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2335871,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8392157,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":220267,"mean":13.157678388857,"rank":123186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":76627,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":220267,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":482,"mean":8.8788399168399,"rank":351,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":95,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":482,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":15.342,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
