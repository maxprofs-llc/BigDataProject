Physical and ultrasonographical examination revealed large fluctuating fluid filled bladder with distinct dimensions. The cysts were successfully removed along with its membrane and parasitological examination revealed it as a Coenurus gaigeri, the intermediate stage of T. multiceps gaigeri. The present report describes the retro-bulbar cyst of Coenurus gaigeri in two Barbari goats. This is the first report of retro-bulbar cyst of Coenurus gaigeri in goats.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dc1","authors":["Nitika Sharma","Ashok Kumar","Vinay Chaturvedi","Shivsharanappa Nayakwadi","A.
