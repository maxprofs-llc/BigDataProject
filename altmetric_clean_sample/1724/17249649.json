Here, we review the strategies for systems metabolic engineering and particularly its applications in Escherichia coli. First, we cover the various tools developed for genetic manipulation in E. coli to increase the production titers of desired chemicals. Next, we detail the strategies for systems metabolic engineering in E. coli, covering the engineering of the native metabolism, the expansion of metabolism with synthetic pathways, and the process engineering aspects undertaken to achieve higher production titers of desired chemicals. Finally, we examine a couple of notable products as case studies produced in E. coli strains developed by systems metabolic engineering. The large portfolio of chemical products successfully produced by engineered E. coli listed here demonstrates the sheer capacity of what can be envisioned and achieved with respect to microbial production of chemicals. Systems metabolic engineering is no longer in its infancy; it is now widely employed and is also positioned to further embrace next-generation interdisciplinary principles and innovation for its upgrade. Systems metabolic engineering will play increasingly important roles in developing industrial strains including E. coli that are capable of efficiently producing natural and nonnatural chemicals and materials from renewable nonfood biomass.","authors":["Choi, Kyeong Rok","Shin, Jae Ho","Cho, Jae Sung","Yang, Dongsoo","Lee, Sang Yup"],"doi":"10.1128\/ecosalplus.esp-0088-2015","first_seen_on":"2017-03-11T13:28:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2324-6200"],"issue":"2","journal":"EcoSal Plus","last_mentioned_on":1489238916,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28281437"],"pmid":"28281437","pubdate":"2017-03-11T22:03:27+00:00","title":"Systems Metabolic Engineering of Escherichia coli.","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/systems-metabolic-engineering-escherichia-coli-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
