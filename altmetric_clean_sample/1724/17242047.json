The Aedes albopictus mosquito as the vector of dengue fever surged exponentially in the last decade, raising ecological and epistemological concerns of how climate change altered its growth rate and population dynamics. As the global warming pattern is considerably uneven across four seasons, with a confirmed stronger effect in winter, an emerging need arises as to exploring how the seasonal warming effects influence the annual development of Ae. albopictus.\nThe model consolidates a 35-year climate dataset and designs fifteen warming patterns that increase the temperature of selected seasons. Based on a recently developed mechanistic population model of Ae. albopictus, the model simulates the thermal reaction of blood-fed adults by systematically increasing the temperature from 0.5 to 5\u00a0\u00b0C at an interval of 0.5\u00a0\u00b0C in each warming pattern.\nThe results show the warming effects are different across seasons. The warming effects in spring and winter facilitate the development of the species by shortening the diapause period. The warming effect in summer is primarily negative by inhibiting mosquito development. The warming effect in autumn is considerably mixed. However, these warming effects cannot carry over to the following year, possibly due to the fact that under the extreme weather in winter the mosquito fully ceases from development and survives in terms of diapause eggs.\nAs the historical pattern of global warming manifests seasonal fluctuations, this study provides corroborating and previously ignored evidence of how such seasonality affects the mosquito development. Understanding this short-term temperature-driven mechanism as one chain of the transmission events is critical to refining the thermal reaction norms of the epidemic vector under global warming as well as developing effective mosquito prevention and control strategies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000883","authors":["Pengfei Jia","Xiang Chen","Jin Chen","Liang Lu","Qiyong Liu","Xiaoyue Tan"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13071-017-2071-2","first_seen_on":"2017-03-11T08:28:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1756-3305"],"issue":"1","journal":"Parasites & Vectors","last_mentioned_on":1494931805,"links":["http:\/\/parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s13071-017-2071-2?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28284225?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s13071-017-2071-2?site=parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"28284225","pubdate":"2017-03-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"140","subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"How does the dengue vector mosquito Aedes albopictus respond to global warming?","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dengue-vector-mosquito-aedes-albopictus-respond-global-warming-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":2.25,"6m":2.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8213437,"mean":6.9553152651275,"rank":3452314,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4709113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8213437,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236352,"mean":13.758140832913,"rank":97748,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":136278,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236352,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2288,"mean":3.7129768255356,"rank":778,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":1477,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2288,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":162,"mean":2.8544844720497,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":162,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
