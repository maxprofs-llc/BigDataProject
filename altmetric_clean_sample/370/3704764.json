Here, the authors call attention to a growing trend of measuring the sociocultural environment. They present a quantitative review of studies that measure cultural differences in \"cultural products\": tangible, public representations of culture such as advertising or popular texts. They found that cultural products that come from Western cultures (mostly the United States) are more individualistic, and less collectivistic, than cultural products that come from collectivistic cultures (including Korea, Japan, China, and Mexico). The effect sizes for cultural products were larger than self-report effect sizes for this dimension (reported in Oyserman, Coon, & Kemmelmeier, 2002). In addition to presenting this evidence, the authors highlight the importance of studying the dynamic relationships between sociocultural environments and psyches.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032cb","authors":["Beth Morling","Marika Lamoreaux","Morling B","Lamoreaux M"],"doi":"10.1177\/1088868308318260","endpage":"221","first_seen_on":"2015-02-17T01:58:56+00:00","issns":["1532-7957","1088-8683"],"issue":"3","journal":"Personality & Social Psychology Review (Sage Publications Inc.)","last_mentioned_on":1446948478,"links":["http:\/\/psr.sagepub.com\/content\/12\/3\/199","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1177\/1088868308318260","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18544712"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/psr.sagepub.com\/content\/12\/3\/199.full.pdf","pmid":"18544712","pubdate":"2008-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"199","subjects":["socialsciences","psychology"],"title":"Measuring culture outside the head: a meta-analysis of individualism-collectivism in cultural products.","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/measuring-culture-outside-head-metaanalysis-individualismcollectivism-cultural-products"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.976,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.976},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6535340,"mean":6.0620751486637,"rank":508155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":6027147,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6535340,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":183094,"mean":9.5071363405485,"rank":22722,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":160371,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":183094,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246,"mean":21.253387755102,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":170,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":13.415428571429,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":19,"Student  > Doctoral Student":21,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Ph.
