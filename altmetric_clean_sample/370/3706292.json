NTM are ubiquitous and can be found in numerous environments, including households and water plants. However, NTM have not been reported to be associated with the healthy human oral microbiome. Since the oral cavity and upper respiratory track are the main ports of entry of microorganisms into the human body, elucidating NTM diversity and prevalence will assist in the assessment of the potential risks of infection elicited by these opportunistic pathogens. Here, we report the identification of a 'non-tuberculous mycobacteriome' in healthy individuals. We employed a modified DNA extraction procedure in conjunction with mycobacterial-specific primers to screen niches in the oral cavity (buccal mucosa and dental plaque) and upper respiratory tract (nostrils and oropharynx) of 10 healthy subjects. A total of 50 prevalent operational taxonomic units sequenced on MiSeq (Illumina) using 16S rRNA V3-V4 region were detected across all screened niches, showing the presence of diverse NTM communities. NTM DNA was detected in the nostrils of all 10 subjects, in buccal mucosa of 8 subjects, in the oropharynx of 7 subjects, and in the dental plaques of 5 subjects. Results from quantitative PCR showed each individual harbored 10(3)-10(4) predicted NTM per each screened niche. The modification of standard DNA isolation methods to increase sensitivity toward mycobacterial species represents an important step to advance the knowledge of the oral as well as the overall human microbiome. These findings clearly reveal for the first time that healthy individuals harbor a 'non-tuberculous mycobacteriome' in their oral cavity and upper respiratory tract and may have important implications in our understanding of infections caused by NTM.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f610004089","authors":["Lilia Macovei","Jon McCafferty","Tsute Chen","Flavia Teles","Hatice Hasturk","Bruce J Paster","Antonio Campos-Neto"],"doi":"10.3402\/jom.v7.26094","first_seen_on":"2015-02-17T11:30:01+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid"],"issns":["2000-2297"],"journal":"Journal of Oral Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1425622588,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25683180?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25683180?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.journaloforalmicrobiology.net\/index.php\/jom\/article\/view\/26094"],"pmid":"25683180","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"The hidden \u2018mycobacteriome\u2019 of the human healthy oral cavity and upper respiratory tract","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hidden-mycobacteriome-human-healthy-oral-cavity-upper-respiratory-tract"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8350816,"mean":7.043663844779,"rank":1186235,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":7162206,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8350816,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":214513,"mean":9.1552623442978,"rank":38793,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":175620,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":214513,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":166,"mean":5.1832363636364,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":166,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":3,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
