Since the function of vitamin D receptor (VDR) represents the effect of vitamin D on the body and genetic variations in VDR gene may affect its function, we aim to highlight the association of two VDR gene polymorphisms with MS susceptibility. In current study, we recruited 113 MS patients and 122 healthy controls. TaqI (rs731236) and ApaI (rs7975232) genetic variations in these two groups were evaluated using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique. All genotype and allele frequencies in both variations showed association with the disease status. However, to find the definite connection between genetic variations in VDR gene and MS disease in a population of South East of Iran, more researches on gene structure and its function with regard to patients' conditions are required.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef852a83ee09648b548f","authors":["Mehrnaz Narooie-Nejad","Maryam Moossavi","Adam Torkamanzehi","Ali Moghtaderi"],"doi":"10.1155\/2015\/427519","first_seen_on":"2015-02-17T12:59:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2314-6141"],"journal":"BioMed Research International","last_mentioned_on":1447278935,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25685788?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4320885\/"],"pmid":"25685788","title":"Positive Association of Vitamin D Receptor Gene Variations with Multiple Sclerosis in South East Iranian Population","type":"article","volume":"2015","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/positive-association-vitamin-d-receptor-gene-variations-multiple-sclerosis-south-east-iranian-popula-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6559289,"mean":6.0768461753774,"rank":2256459,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4253507,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6559289,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":183268,"mean":9.5105754773093,"rank":65112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":116338,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":183268,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3777,"mean":2.6596583686441,"rank":632,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":3117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3777,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82,"mean":2.8901234567901,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":55,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
