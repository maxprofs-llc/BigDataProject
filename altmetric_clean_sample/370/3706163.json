Here, we evaluated the anti-obesity impact of unfermented (URAM) versus fermented RAM (FRAM) using both in vitro and in vivo models. Both URAM and FRAM exhibited marked anti-inflammatory, anti-adipogenic, and anti-obesity activities, and modulation of the gut microbial distribution. However, FRAM, compared to URAM, resulted in more efficient suppression of NO production and normalization of transepithelial electrical resistance in LPS-treated RAW 264.7 and HCT 116 cells, respectively. Compared to URAM, FRAM more effectively reduced the adipose tissue weight; ameliorated the serum triglyceride and aspartate transaminase levels; restored the serum HDL level and intestinal epithelial barrier function in the LPS control group. The relative abundance of Bifidobacterium and Akkermansia as well as Bacteriodetes\/Firmicutes ratio in the gut of the LPS control group was significantly enhanced by both URAM and FRAM. However, FRAM, but not URAM, resulted in a significant increase in the distribution of Bacteriodetes and Lactobacillus in the gut of the HFD + LPS group. Our results suggest that FRAM with probiotics can exert a greater anti-obesity effect than URAM, which is probably mediated at least in part via regulation of the intestinal microbiota and gut permeability.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Jing-Hua Wang","Shambhunath Bose","Hyung-Gu Kim","Kyung-Sun Han","Hojun Kim"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep08391","first_seen_on":"2015-02-17T11:17:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322","xxxx-xxxx"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1455019749,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25684573?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/srep\/2015\/150216\/srep08391\/full\/srep08391.html"],"pmid":"25684573","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Preclinical research","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Fermented Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae alleviates high fat diet-induced obesity in association with regulation of intestinal permeability and microbiota in rats","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fermented-rhizoma-atractylodis-macrocephalae-alleviates-high-fat-dietinduced-obesity-association-reg"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7156405,"mean":6.3086437613049,"rank":1563981,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":5562460,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7156405,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208670,"mean":8.7934689005076,"rank":56605,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":151173,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208670,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26036,"mean":14.51653566353,"rank":8474,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":17428,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26036,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1015,"mean":15.685360946746,"rank":373,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":634,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1015,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
