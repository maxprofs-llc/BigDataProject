The secondary injury results from the biological cascade after the primary injury and affects previous uninjured, healthy tissue. Therefore, the mitigation of such a cascade would benefit patients suffering a primary injury and allow the body to recover more quickly. Unfortunately, the delivery of effective therapeutics is quite limited. Due to the inefficient delivery of therapeutic drugs, nanoparticles have become a major field of exploration for medical applications. Based on their material properties, they can help treat disease by delivering drugs to specific tissues, enhancing detection methods, or a mixture of both. Incorporating nanomedicine into the treatment of neuronal injury and disease would likely push nanomedicine into a new light. This review highlights the various pathological issues involved in secondary spinal cord injury, current treatment options, and the improvements that could be made using a nanomedical approach.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f610007966","authors":["D\u00e9sir\u00e9e White-Schenk","Riyi Shi","James F Leary"],"doi":"10.2147\/ijn.s75686","first_seen_on":"2015-02-17T19:25:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":[],"journal":"International Journal of Nanomedicine","last_mentioned_on":1424276985,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4321603\/"],"pmid":"25673988","pubdate":"2015-02-17T20:15:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"923","title":"Nanomedicine strategies for treatment of secondary spinal cord injury","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nanomedicine-strategies-treatment-secondary-spinal-cord-injury-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4777873,"mean":5.7255729211695,"rank":1953337,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2800665,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4777873,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":152595,"mean":9.7230901870325,"rank":59571,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":91766,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":152595,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1254,"mean":1.6892976855547,"rank":223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":1027,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1254,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.5172857142857,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
