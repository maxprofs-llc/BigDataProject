Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) participates in the pathology of injury and protection of myocardium but whether or not electrical stimulation modulates endogenous CGRP is not clear. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups: 1) control group, without any treatment. 2) I\/R group, animals were subjected to 30min of myocardial ischemia followed by 60min reperfusion. 3) NES+I\/R group, non-excitatory electrical stimulation (NES) was commenced from 15min before coronary artery occlusion till the end of reperfusion. 4) I\/R+CGRP8-37 group, animals were given with CGRP8-37 (an antagonist of CGRP receptor, 10(-7)mol\/L, 0.3ml, i.v.) at 5min before reperfusion without any electrical stimulation. The hemodynamics and electrocardiogram were monitored and recorded. Infarct size and troponin I were examined and CGRP expression in the myocardium and serum was analyzed. It was found that the infarct size and TnI were significantly reduced in NES+I\/R group, by 45% and 58% respectively, accompanied by an obvious fall back of CGRP in myocardium, compared to I\/R group (all p<0.05). Treatment with CGRP8-37 resulted in the same protection on myocardium as NES did. No significant difference in hemodynamics or ventricular tachycardia was detected among the groups (all p>0.05). It can be concluded that NES reduced the infarction size after acute myocardial ischemia and reperfusion, for which the underlying mechanism may be associated with modulation of endogenous CGRP in myocardium.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032be","authors":["Zhi-Jia Guo","Zheng Guo"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.peptides.2015.01.010","first_seen_on":"2015-02-18T11:15:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-5169"],"journal":"Peptides","last_mentioned_on":1450868495,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25687546?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25687546","pubdate":"2015-02-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Non-excitatory electrical stimulation attenuates myocardial infarction via homeostasis of calcitonin gene-related peptide in myocardium.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nonexcitatory-electrical-stimulation-attenuates-myocardial-infarction-via-homeostasis-calcitonin-gen"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6818838,"mean":6.1901666501164,"rank":5832433,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6818838,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":206671,"mean":8.7663446944405,"rank":168329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":206671,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":663,"mean":2.4440060422961,"rank":536,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":663,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.6,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
