Even if a burned hand does not play a major role for the survival of a patient, its function and aesthetic appearance are of utmost importance for the re-integration into society and professional life. Adequate treatment demands a number of major decisions: necessity of an escharotomy in the early post-traumatic phase, the timing of surgery and the type of wound coverage, as well as immobilization and rehabilitation. Rapid wound closure is of utmost importance, but infection control and the preservation of active and passive motion are also essential for optimal recovery of the injured hand. The treatment of hand burns requires the interdisciplinary teamwork of surgeons, physio- and occupational therapists, psychologists, motivated health care personnel and consequent treatment strategies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000247d","authors":["Kamolz, Lars-Peter","Kitzinger, Hugo B","Karle, Birgit","Frey, Manfred"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.burns.2008.08.004","first_seen_on":"2015-02-16T22:36:47+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["03054179","1879-1409"],"issue":"3","journal":"Burns (03054179)","last_mentioned_on":1424126147,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0305417908002659"],"pmid":"18952379","pubdate":"2009-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"The treatment of hand burns ","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/treatment-hand-burns"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4766922,"mean":5.7154393676794,"rank":3988657,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4766922,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":153112,"mean":9.7115543494591,"rank":126123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":153112,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":485,"mean":2.6422975206612,"rank":378,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":485,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":1.2517857142857,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
