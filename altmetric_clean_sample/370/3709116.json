Here we report that mice lacking the essential mTORC2 component rictor in liver (Lrictor(KO)) are unable to respond normally to insulin. In response to insulin, Lrictor(KO) mice failed to inhibit hepatic glucose output. Lrictor(KO) mice also fail to develop hepatic steatosis on a high fat diet and manifest half-normal serum cholesterol levels. This is accompanied by lower levels of expression of SREBP-1c and SREBP-2 and genes of fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis. Lrictor(KO) mice had defects in insulin-stimulated Akt Ser-473 and Thr-308 phosphorylation, leading to decreased phosphorylation of Akt substrates FoxO, GSK-3\u03b2, PRAS40, AS160, and Tsc2. Lrictor(KO) mice also manifest defects in insulin-activated mTORC1 activity, evidenced by decreased S6 kinase and Lipin1 phosphorylation. Glucose intolerance and insulin resistance of Lrictor(KO) mice could be fully rescued by hepatic expression of activated Akt2 or dominant negative FoxO1. However, in the absence of mTORC2, forced Akt2 activation was unable to drive hepatic lipogenesis. Thus, we have identified an Akt-independent relay from mTORC2 to hepatic lipogenesis that separates the effects of insulin on glucose and lipid metabolism.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Minsheng Yuan","Elizabeth Pino","Lianfeng Wu","Michael Kacergis","Alexander A.
