Such bacteriocin inhibits wide range of food-borne pathogens such as pathogenic Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Yersinia enterocolitica and a strain of Corynebacterium sp. In the present study, plg-1 gene expressing propionicin PLG-1 was isolated, sequenced for the first time and the resulting sequence was analysed using several web-based bioinformatics programs. The PCR product containing plg-1 gene was transferred to different lactic acid bacterial (LAB) strains using pLEB590 as a cloning vector to give the modified vector pLEBPLG-1. LAB transformants showed an antimicrobial activity against Esch. coli DH5\u03b1 (most affected strain), Listeria monocytogenes 18116, and Salmonella enterica 25566 as model pathogenic strains. Such LAB transformants can be used in dairy industry to control the food-borne pathogens that are largely distributed worldwide and to feed schoolchildren in the poor countries where dangerous epidemic diseases and diarrhoea prevail.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c31","authors":["Sameh E Mohamed","Mahmoud K Tahoun"],"doi":"10.1017\/s0022029915000011","first_seen_on":"2015-02-17T14:36:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1469-7629"],"journal":"Journal of Dairy Research","last_mentioned_on":1424525313,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25684078?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/action\/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=9560565&fileId=S0022029915000011"],"pmid":"25684078","pubdate":"2015-02-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"The expression of propionicin PLG-1 gene (plg-1) by lactic starters","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expression-propionicin-plg1-gene-plg1-lactic-starters"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4786878,"mean":5.7306131433941,"rank":1980135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2725366,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4786878,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":152963,"mean":9.7209388083317,"rank":60970,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":88714,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":152963,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102,"mean":1.7453861386139,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/pseudo_papers\/status\/567693983493545987","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3706880],"posted_on":"2015-02-17T14:36:07+00:00","author":{"name":"pseudomonaspapers","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/?term=pseudomonas","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/570219565901029376\/j3RfXxUz_normal.jpeg","description":"PubMed search bot for pseudomonas.
