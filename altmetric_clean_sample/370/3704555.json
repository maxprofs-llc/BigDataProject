By determining the electric current in the LC resonant circuit, a maximum intensity of magnetic field around of 15 mT is calculated, with a frequency around of 206 kHz. This ac magnetic field is able to heat powdered magnetic materials embedded in biological systems to be used in biomedical applications. Indeed, in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the device we also present the measurements of the specific absorption rate in phantoms performed with commercially prepared Fe(3)O(4) and distilled water at different concentrations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2011RScI...82k4904C","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003488","authors":["M.
