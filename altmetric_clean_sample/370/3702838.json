Clotting time tests essentially measure the onset of clot formation which results from the formation of fibrin fibers in the blood sample. However, such assays are inherently imprecise due to the highly variable nature of the clot formation process and the sample matrix. This work describes a clotting time measurement assay which uses a fluorescent probe to very precisely detect the onset of fibrin clot formation. It uses a microstructured surface which enhances the formation of multiple localized clot loci and which results in the abrupt redistribution of the fluorescent label at the onset of clot formation in both whole blood and plasma. This methodology was applied to the development of an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) test in a lateral flow microfluidic platform and used to monitor the effect of heparin dosage where it showed linearity from 0 to 2 U\/mL in spiked plasma samples (R(2)=0.996, n = 3), correlation against gold standard coagulometry of 0.9986, and correlation against standard hospital aPTT in 32 patient samples of 0.78.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224e","authors":["Magdalena M Dudek","Nigel Kent","Kerstin M Gustafsson","Tomas L Lindahl","Anthony J Killard"],"doi":"10.1021\/ac102436v","first_seen_on":"2015-02-16T11:38:23+00:00","issns":["1520-6882"],"journal":"Analytical Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1424086673,"links":["http:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/49648977_Fluorescence-based_blood_coagulation_assay_device_for_measuring_activated_partial_thromboplastin_time"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Tomas_Lindahl\/publication\/49648977_Fluorescence-based_blood_coagulation_assay_device_for_measuring_activated_partial_thromboplastin_time\/links\/0a85e52eb709e8f281000000.pdf","pmid":"21121686","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Fluorescence-based blood coagulation assay device for measuring activated partial thromboplastin time.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fluorescencebased-blood-coagulation-assay-device-measuring-activated-partial-thromboplastin-time"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4766611,"mean":5.7161277746686,"rank":3375773,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":778274,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4766611,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":153109,"mean":9.7114530135593,"rank":109758,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":26989,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":153109,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5223,"mean":2.7970716200689,"rank":3150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":267,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5223,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279,"mean":2.5621870503597,"rank":201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
