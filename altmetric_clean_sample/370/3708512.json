In this work, we present experimental strategies using tandem-MS fragmentation to increase the spatial resolution of the technique to the single residue level to provide a high precision tool for molecular biophysics research. Overall, in this study we demonstrated an eight-fold increase in structural resolution compared to peptide level assessments. In addition, to provide a quantitative analysis of residue based solvent accessibility and protein topography as a basis for high-resolution structure prediction; we illustrate strategies of data transformation using the relative reactivity of side chains as a normalization strategy and predict side-chain surface area from the footprinting data. We tested the methods by examination of Ca+2-calmodulin showing highly significant correlations between surface area and side-chain contact predictions for individual side chains and the crystal structure. Tandem ion based HRF-MS provides quantitative high-resolution protein topology information in solution that can fill existing gaps in structure determination for large proteins and macromolecular complexes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081d9","authors":["Parminder Kaur","Janna Kiselar","Sichun Yang","Mark R Chance"],"doi":"10.1074\/mcp.o114.044362","first_seen_on":"2015-02-18T11:22:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1535-9484"],"journal":"Molecular and Cellular Proteomics","last_mentioned_on":1450782213,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25687570?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25687570","http:\/\/www.mcponline.org\/content\/early\/2015\/02\/16\/mcp.O114.044362.short?rss=1"],"pmid":"25687570","pubdate":"2015-02-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Quantitative protein topography analysis and high-resolution structure prediction using hydroxyl radical labeling and tandem-ion mass spectrometry","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quantitative-protein-topography-analysis-highresolution-structure-prediction-using-hydroxyl-radical"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7915726,"mean":6.6963151872954,"rank":3571300,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4265615,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7915726,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":211600,"mean":8.9867044740287,"rank":87441,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":120597,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":211600,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1556,"mean":3.6376617363344,"rank":691,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":815,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1556,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":2.8584905660377,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
