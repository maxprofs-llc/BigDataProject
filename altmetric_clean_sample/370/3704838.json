Objective weight and height were collected, and weight status was defined according to the International Obesity Task Force body mass index growth curve centiles.\nIn all, 29.5% (95% CI\u00a0= 26.7, 32.5) of males and 22.8% (95% CI\u00a0= 20.5, 25.2) of females were overweight or obese. A total of 2.2% (95% CI\u00a0= 1.5, 3.2) of males and 4.5% (95% CI\u00a0= 4.4, 4.5) of females met DSM-5 criteria for an ED; in addition, 1.1% (95% CI\u00a0= 0.7, 1.9) of males and 5.1% (95% CI\u00a0= 4.0, 6.5) of females were identified with a subthreshold ED. Both full- and subthreshold EDs were significantly associated with markedly impaired psychosocial functioning. There was a significant relationship between prevalence of EDs and weight status, with an increased risk for a bulimic disorder in obese relative to normal-weight males (odds ratio [OR]\u00a0= 7.86) and females (OR\u00a0= 3.27).\nThis study provides estimates for the prevalence of DSM-5 EDs in adolescents, further support for their impact on mental health, and new evidence for an association between bulimic disorders and obesity. Results call for an integrated approach in research and prevention regarding the whole spectrum of eating- and weight-related disorders.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f53","authors":["Flament, Martine F","Henderson, Katherine","Buchholz, Annick","Obeid, Nicole","Nguyen, Hien N T","Birmingham, Meagan","Goldfield, Gary"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jaac.2015.01.020","first_seen_on":"2015-02-17T02:10:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0890-8567","1527-5418"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1439422511,"links":["http:\/\/www.jaacap.com\/article\/S0890-8567(15)00076-3\/abstract?rss=yes","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=3&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jaacap.com%2Farticle%2FS0890-8567%2815%2900076-3%2Fabstract%3Frss%3Dyes&code=jaac-site&fb_ref=Default&fb_source=message","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=3&redirect=http:\/\/www.jaacap.com\/article\/S0890-8567(15)00076-3\/abstract?rss=yes&code=jaac-site","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25901777","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0890856715000763","http:\/\/www.jaacap.com\/article\/S0890-8567(15)00076-3\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jaacap.com\/article\/S0890856715000763\/pdf","pmid":"25901777","pubdate":"2015-04-23T22:01:08+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry","pediatrics"],"title":"Weight Status and DSM-5 Diagnoses of Eating Disorders in Adolescents From the Community","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/weight-status-dsm5-diagnoses-eating-disorders-adolescents-community"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5476876,"mean":6.3619433143891,"rank":2244850,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":3203580,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5476876,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169403,"mean":9.7762515318592,"rank":66888,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":101180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169403,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1295,"mean":10.907476043277,"rank":687,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":602,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1295,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":135,"mean":9.4987014925373,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":135,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
