It poses the question of whether selective procreation should be considered as a moral obligation of prospective parents. To answer this question, a number of different ethical approaches to the problem are presented and critically analysed: the utilitarian; Julian Savulescu's principle of procreative beneficence; the rights-based. The main thesis of the article is that these approaches fail to provide any appealing principles on which reproductive decisions should be based. They constitute failures of imagination which may result in counter-intuitive moral judgments about both life with disability and genetic selection. A full appreciation of the ethical significance of recognition in procreative decisions leads to a more nuanced and morally satisfying view than other leading alternatives presented in the article.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023cc","authors":["Soniewicka, Marta"],"doi":"10.1111\/bioe.12153","endpage":"563","first_seen_on":"2015-02-17T08:23:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1467-8519","0269-9702"],"issue":"8","journal":"Bioethics","last_mentioned_on":1424709661,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/bioe.12153\/abstract;jsessionid=06C143E455DCC6F814597B3080777F65.f02t01","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111%2Fbioe.12153&fb_ref=Default&fb_source=message","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/bioe.12153\/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/bioe.12153\/abstract;jsessionid=74327ECE226624BF533784DF019D20EF.f01t04","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/bioe.12153"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/bioe.12153\/pdf","pmid":"25689344","pubdate":"2015-02-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Ethics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Philosophy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"557","subjects":["ethics"],"title":"Failures of Imagination: Disability and the Ethics of Selective Reproduction","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/failures-imagination-disability-ethics-selective-reproduction"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.45,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6395526,"mean":5.982299586664,"rank":1367439,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":5021030,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6395526,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":181626,"mean":9.4340594191329,"rank":53080,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":128098,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":181626,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":419,"mean":4.7950574162679,"rank":138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":280,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":419,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":6.6411428571429,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":4,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":3,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Unspecified":1,"Philosophy":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"GB":1},"mendeley":{"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/futuramiah\/status\/567600262643081218","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3705604],"posted_on":"2015-02-17T08:23:42+00:00","author":{"name":"Andy Android","url":"http:\/\/www.andymiah.net","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/744865841599160320\/yTTwVJ4C_normal.jpg","description":"I am an experimental dreamspace dedicated to Prof Andy Miah.
