These plaques appear as map-like areas of thickened, roughened, and wrinkled part of the endocardium in the left atrium. Perhaps they are caused by regurgitant jets of blood flow, due to incompetence of the mitral valve. Although MacCallum plaques are one of the characteristic features in rheumatic heart disease, they are very uncommon in recent times. We hereby report a case of an adolescent female with RHD, who was working as a housemaid in a doctor's house for a few months, and suddenly developed respiratory tract infection and cardiac failure. She died on the fourth day of admission. A medicolegal autopsy was conducted, as her relatives accused her master of sexual assault. On autopsy it was seen that the mitral valves were narrowed, showing multiple vegetations. MacCallum plaque was seen in the dilated left atrium. Hence, it is presented here for educative purposes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5253cf058f610003d1e","authors":["Shivakumarswamy"],"doi":"10.4103\/1995-705x.73220","first_seen_on":"2015-02-16T05:15:19+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Heart Views","last_mentioned_on":1400305345,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.4103\/1995-705X.73220","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21188002","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3000917"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.heartviews.org\/article.asp?issn=1995-705X;year=2010;volume=11;issue=2;spage=71;epage=73;aulast=Shivakumarswamy;type=2","pmid":"21188002","publisher":"Medknow Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"title":"\u201cMacCallum Plaque of the Heart\u201d: A Medicolegal Case","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/maccallum-plaque-heart-medicolegal-case"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3753535,"mean":4.9902431756349,"rank":854829,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2374554,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3753535,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109592,"mean":9.3686507286183,"rank":33283,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":75115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109592,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":2.456,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"JP":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"William George MacCallum","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=608923503#altmetric_citation_18","license":"public","citation_ids":[3700924],"posted_on":"2014-05-17T05:42:25+00:00","summary":"William George MacCallum (18 April 1874 \u2013 3 February 1944) was a Canadian-American physician and pathologist.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=42753296","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Chhandama","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Chhandama"}}]}}
