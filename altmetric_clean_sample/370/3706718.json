The objective was to provide patients with basic information on the contribution of stressors in the occurrence of temporomandibular joint dysfunction and educate on methods for coping with stress most commonly used in psychology. In the course of three meetings, patients are familiarised with the issue of experienced stress as a potential source of psychosomatic illnesses (in particular, temporomandibular joint dysfunction). Preliminary patients' opinions, expressed through self-report methods, indicate significant usefulness of the developed psychoeducational program for the process of treatment and the quality of patients' lives.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef852a83ee09648b548f","authors":["Biega&#x144;ska, Joanna","Biega\u0144ska J","Pihut M"],"doi":"10.1155\/2014\/678169","first_seen_on":"2015-02-17T13:48:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2314-6133"],"journal":"BioMed Research International","last_mentioned_on":1455119352,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/bmri\/2014\/678169\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25610871"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/bmri\/2014\/678169.pdf","pmid":"25610871","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","title":"Psychoeducation Program on Strategies for Coping with Stress in Patients with Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction","type":"article","volume":"2014","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/psychoeducation-program-strategies-coping-stress-patients-temporomandibular-joint-dysfunction"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.55,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7168681,"mean":6.3131530881527,"rank":1559080,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":5600755,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7168681,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208808,"mean":8.795393688909,"rank":56358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":152141,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208808,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3916,"mean":2.7514901660281,"rank":504,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":3410,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3916,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":3.0487804878049,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":60,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
