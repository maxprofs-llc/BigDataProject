The advances in medical informatics and human factors engineering have provided possibility for novel and user-friendly clinical decision support tools that can be applied in a complex and busy hospital setting. To facilitate timely and accurate best-practice delivery in critically ill patients international group of intensive care unit (ICU) physicians and researchers developed a simple decision support tool: Checklist for Early Recognition and Treatment of Acute Illness (CERTAIN). The tool has been refined and tested in high fidelity simulated clinical environment and has been shown to improve performance of clinical providers faced with simulated emergencies. The aim of this international educational intervention is to implement CERTAIN into clinical practice in hospital settings with variable resources (included those in low income countries) and evaluate the impact of the tool on the care processes and patient outcomes. To accomplish our aims, CERTAIN will be uniformly available on either mobile or fixed computing devices (as well as a backup paper version) and applied in a standardized manner in the ICUs of diverse hospitals. To ensure the effectiveness of the proposed intervention, access to CERTAIN is coupled with structured training of bedside ICU providers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","authors":["Marija Vukoja","Rahul Kashyap","Srdjan Gavrilovic","Yue Dong","Oguz Kilickaya","Ognjen Gajic"],"doi":"10.5492\/wjccm.v4.i1.55","first_seen_on":"2015-02-17T11:10:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2220-3141"],"issue":"1","journal":"International Journal of Food Contamination","last_mentioned_on":1428065150,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25685723?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25685723"],"pmcid":"PMC4326764","pmid":"25685723","pubdate":"2015-02-04T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Checklist for early recognition and treatment of acute illness: International collaboration to improve critical care practice.","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/checklist-early-recognition-treatment-acute-illness-international-collaboration-improve-critical-car-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
