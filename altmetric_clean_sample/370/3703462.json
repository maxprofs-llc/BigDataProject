They outline psychoanalytic concepts that were employed to develop a psychodynamic approach to panic disorder, including the idea of unconscious mental life and the existence of defense mechanisms, compromise formations, the pleasure principle, and the transference. The authors then describe a panic-focused psychodynamic treatment based on a psychodynamic formulation of panic. Clinical techniques used in this approach, such as working with transference and working through, are described. Finally, a case vignette is employed to illustrate the relevance of these factors to panic disorder and the use of this treatment.(The Journal of Psychotherapy Practice and Research 1999; 8:234-242)","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e19","authors":["Fredric N.
