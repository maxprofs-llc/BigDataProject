Herein, large-scale aligned DNA nanowires were crafted by flow-enabled self-assembly (FESA). The highly oriented and continuous DNA nanowires were then capitalized on either as a template to form metallic nanowires by exposing DNA nanowires that had been preloaded with metal salts to an oxygen plasma or as a scaffold to direct the positioning and alignment of metal nanoparticles and nanorods. The FESA strategy is simple and easy to implement and thus a promising new method for the low-cost synthesis of large-scale one-dimensional nanostructures for nanodevices.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Li, Bo","Zhang, Chuchu","Jiang, Beibei","Han, Wei","Lin, Zhiqun"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201412388","endpage":"4254","first_seen_on":"2015-02-16T22:07:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1521-3773","1433-7851"],"issue":"14","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
