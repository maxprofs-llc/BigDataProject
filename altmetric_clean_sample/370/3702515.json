In addition, polygynous societies reportedly have lower 2D:4D (higher PAE) than more monogamous populations. This evidence suggests that PAE may be implicated in the development of sexually selected behaviors in humans. To place 2D:4D research into a broader context, we test the relationship between digit ratios and behavior across nonhuman anthropoids; polygynous species, with higher levels of intrasexual competition, should have more pronounced markers of PAE (lower 2D:4D) than pair-bonded species. Our results accord with those found in humans: 2D:4D is lower in polygynous species and higher (lower PAE) in pair-bonded species. Old World monkeys have low, and relatively invariant 2D:4D (high PAE), which is coupled with high levels of intrasexual competition. This contrasts with higher and more variable ratios in both great apes and New World monkeys. In addition, both male and female ratios decrease with increasing levels of intrasexual competition. Human ratios are intermediate between pair-bonded and more promiscuous hominoids. We propose that PAE may be involved in promoting species characteristic social behavior in anthropoids.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e03cf058f6100020f1","authors":["Nelson E","Shultz S","Nelson, Emma","Shultz, Susanne","Emma Nelson","Susanne Shultz"],"doi":"10.1002\/ajpa.21157","endpage":"405","first_seen_on":"2015-02-16T09:42:24+00:00","issns":["1096-8644","0002-9483","00029483","10968644"],"issue":"3","journal":"American Journal of Physical Anthropology","last_mentioned_on":1446890820,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ajpa.21157\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19862809"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ajpa.21157\/pdf","pmid":"19862809","pubdate":"2010-03-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Anthropology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Archaeology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"395","subjects":["anthropology"],"title":"Finger length ratios (2D:4D) in anthropoids implicate reduced prenatal androgens in social bonding.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/ajpa.21157","volume":"141","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/finger-length-ratios-2d4d-anthropoids-implicate-reduced-prenatal-androgens-social-bonding"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.08,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451417,"mean":7.1044089350157,"rank":1112093,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":7333633,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451417,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":215879,"mean":9.1726956429095,"rank":36745,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":179066,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":215879,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2059,"mean":9.7589018464529,"rank":464,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":1594,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2059,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":5.860862745098,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Ph.
