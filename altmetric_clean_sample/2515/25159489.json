Four percent chlorhexidine soap was used for patient daily hygiene. All patients are subjected to contact precautions. An in-depth cleaning of the ICU was performed with a chlorine solution, followed by decontamination with VHP. Environmental samples were taken before and after the decontamination.\nFrom July-October 2015, 13 patients were colonized or infected by OXA-48-PE and 18 by MRAB in the ICU. The cumulative incidence of OXA-48-PE and MRAB was 3.48% and 4.81%, respectively. In the period after the intervention, they were 0.8% and 0%, respectively (P\u2009<\u2009.001). Before the VHP biodecontamination, 4.5% of environmental samples were positive for OXA-48-PE and none for MRAB. After biodecontamination, 1.4% of samples were positive for OXA-48-PE.\nThis study emphasizes the importance of environmental hygiene in the control of outbreaks caused by microorganisms of high environmental impact. The rapid effect after the VHP treatment suggests an influence of this measure in eradication.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005709","authors":["A. Robustillo-Rodela","V.
