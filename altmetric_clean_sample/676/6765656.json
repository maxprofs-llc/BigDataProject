The complex accepts electrons from cytochrome c and passes these to molecular oxygen. This process contributes to energy capture in the form of a membrane potential across the inner membrane. The enzyme complex assembles in a stepwise process from the three mitochondria-encoded core subunits Cox1, Cox2 and Cox3, which associate with nuclear-encoded subunits and cofactors. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the cytochrome c oxidase associates with the bc1-complex into supercomplexes, allowing efficient energy transduction. Here we report on Cox26 as a protein found in respiratory chain supercomplexes containing cytochrome c oxidase. Our analyses reveal Cox26 as a novel stoichiometric structural subunit of the cytochrome c oxidase. A loss of Cox26 affects cytochrome c oxidase activity and respirasome organization.","authors":["Levchenko, Maria","Wuttke, Jan-Moritz","R\u00f6mpler, Katharina","Schmidt, Bernhard","Neifer, Klaus","Juris, Lisa","Wissel, Mirjam","Rehling, Peter","Deckers, Markus"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbamcr.2016.04.007","first_seen_on":"2016-04-17T10:27:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0006-3002","01674889"],"journal":"Biochimica et biophysica acta","last_mentioned_on":1460900766,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27083394?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27083394","pubdate":"2016-04-12T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Cox26 is a novel stoichiometric subunit of the yeast cytochrome c oxidase","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cox26-novel-stoichiometric-subunit-yeast-cytochrome-c-oxidase"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
