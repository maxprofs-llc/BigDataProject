Out of 152 patients considered, 58 were still on treatment and 94 discontinued treatment after a median time of 3years. According to an intention-to-treat approach, 52 (34%) patients maintained the NEDA status at the end of follow-up. The proportion of patients with NEDA increases to 41% after excluding from the analysis 64 patients who discontinued natalizumab due to concerns about progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Our findings suggest that natalizumab may ensure higher proportion of patients achieving sustained long-term disease remission than that previously reported with self-injectable treatments (<10%).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f6e","authors":["Prosperini, Luca","Fanelli, Fulvia","Pozzilli, Carlo"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jns.2016.03.025","endpage":"147","first_seen_on":"2016-04-17T10:46:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1878-5883","0022510X"],"journal":"Journal of the Neurological Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1461391200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27084235\/?i=1&from=multiple%20sclerosis","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27084235?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27084235"],"pmid":"27084235","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"145","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Long-term assessment of No Evidence of Disease Activity with natalizumab in relapsing multiple sclerosis","type":"article","volume":"364","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/longterm-assessment-evidence-disease-activity-natalizumab-relapsing-multiple-sclerosis-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.154,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.154},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7591700,"mean":6.5431604635494,"rank":717098,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":6874587,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7591700,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267634,"mean":11.355720453008,"rank":38577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":229055,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267634,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1977,"mean":4.0238562753036,"rank":129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":1848,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1977,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132,"mean":3.3307786259542,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
