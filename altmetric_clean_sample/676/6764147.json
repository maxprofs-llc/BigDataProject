But this is not always the case, giving rise to ethical issues.\n'How do correctional nurses describe their working experience in prisons? What issues emerged?'\nThis is a qualitative descriptive study. Following purposive sampling, we conducted five focus groups. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data.\nOur sample included 31 correctional nurses in seven prisons in Northern Italy.\nThe scientific merit of this study was recognized by the Academic Board of the University of Genoa. Approval to conduct the study was obtained from the Liguria Regional Government that funded this study and from the Local Health Authority that was the prison nurses' employer. Formal consent was obtained from all the nurses who volunteered to participate in this study.\nFive themes emerged from the focus groups: (1) prisoners' healthcare needs, (2) negotiation between custody and care, (3) satisfaction of working in prisons, (4) obstacles to quality care and (5) safety. 'Manipulation' was a transversal theme that emerged from all the focus groups.\nThe problems generated by the clash between prison security and nursing care priorities did not enable nurses to practice autonomously and provide the best possible to care prisoners, giving rise to ethical issues and moral distress. This in turn causes high nursing turnover rates that negatively impact continuum of care.\nIn Italy, correctional nurses urgently require specific education interventions with the participation of all those who work in prisons. Interventions based on the post-modern concept of restorative nursing could offer prison nurses the opportunity to both resolve ethical issues and reduce moral distress.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5103cf058f610003208","authors":["Loredana Sasso","Barbara Delogu","Roberto Carrozzino","Giuseppe Aleo","Annamaria Bagnasco"],"doi":"10.1177\/0969733016639760","first_seen_on":"2016-04-17T08:20:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1477-0989"],"journal":"Nursing Ethics","last_mentioned_on":1463601845,"links":["http:\/\/nej.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2016\/04\/11\/0969733016639760.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/nej.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2016\/04\/11\/0969733016639760.full.pdf","pmid":"27072992","pubdate":"2016-04-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Ethics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing","ethics"],"title":"Ethical issues of prison nursing: A qualitative study in Northern Italy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ethical-issues-prison-nursing-qualitative-study-northern-italy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7715105,"mean":6.6184650148513,"rank":2999728,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4691584,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7715105,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268934,"mean":11.367741415147,"rank":95413,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":172042,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268934,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":298,"mean":2.48167003367,"rank":97,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":201,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":298,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.3388888888889,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Social Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":3},"mendeley":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Prison_Health\/statuses\/721610425717157888","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6764147],"posted_on":"2016-04-17T08:05:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Prison_Health","url":"http:\/\/hiv-insight.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/492953414\/Prison_normal.jpg","description":"Jail, Prison, Criminology, Corrections, et al Also @Hlth_Literacy @HIV_Insight, @Sex_Worker_Hlth","id_on_source":"Prison_Health","tweeter_id":"85601740","geo":{"lt":21.30694,"ln":-157.85833,"country":"US"},"followers":13672},"tweet_id":"721610425717157888"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Hlth_Literacy\/statuses\/721884753411063809","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6764147],"posted_on":"2016-04-18T02:15:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Health Literacy","url":"http:\/\/hiv-insight.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/731064960\/LiteracyII_normal.jpg","description":"Eclectic health info, Health Literacy  Also @HIV_Insight @Prison_Health, @Why_We_Do_That, @Sex_Worker_Hlth","id_on_source":"Hlth_Literacy","tweeter_id":"77314206","geo":{"lt":21.30694,"ln":-157.85833,"country":"US"},"followers":6043},"tweet_id":"721884753411063809"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DrCBurton\/statuses\/721886628365475841","license":"gnip","rt":["Hlth_Literacy"],"citation_ids":[6764147],"posted_on":"2016-04-18T02:22:38+00:00","author":{"name":"no ban, no wall.","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Candace_Burton2","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/672941927273115648\/L4bUJFSa_normal.png","description":"PhD, RN, AFN-BC, AGN-BC, FNAP #nurse #reprojustice #ipv #science #epigenetics #healthdisparities #consent #gender Board member at-large, @NNVAWI Tweets mine","id_on_source":"DrCBurton","tweeter_id":"1134879895","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":547},"tweet_id":"721886628365475841"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HIV_Insight\/statuses\/721922497067790337","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6764147],"posted_on":"2016-04-18T04:45:10+00:00","author":{"name":"HIV Insight","url":"http:\/\/hiv-insight.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/587408973\/INSIGHT_ICON_normal.gif","description":"HIV, AIDS, STI, STD, HPV, Sexuality, LGBT, et al.
