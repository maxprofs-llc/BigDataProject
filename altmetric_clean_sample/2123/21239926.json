In this study, nine SSONs ((ACT)10, (ACT)19, Knob-1 ~ 3, CentC69-1, MR68-3, K10-72-1 and TR1-357-2) were developed and used for chromosome identification in 16 maize (Zea mays L., 2n = 20) inbred lines and hybrids by non-denaturing fluorescence in situ hybridization (ND-FISH). Each SSON produced clear signals on 2 ~ 10 chromosomes of inbred lines B73 and Mo17. A multiplex probe set containing four SSONs ((ACT)10, Knob-2, CentC69-1 and MR68-3) clearly characterized all maize chromosomes in the 16 lines by a single round of ND-FISH and revealed genetic variation at a chromosome level. For example, unique signals on chromosome 6 clearly distinguished all 16 genotypes. The SSONs and multiplex probe developed in this research will facilitate genotype identification and chromosome research in maize.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000c44","authors":[" Minqiu Zhu"," Pei Du"," Lifang Zhuang"," Chenggen Chu"," Han Zhao"," Zengjun Qi"],"doi":"10.1139\/gen-2016-0167","first_seen_on":"2017-06-21T19:22:41+00:00","issns":["0831-2796","1480-3321"],"journal":"Genome","last_mentioned_on":1498046342,"links":["http:\/\/www.nrcresearchpress.com\/doi\/full\/10.1139\/gen-2016-0167?src=recsys#.WUpe1O0rJaQ"],"pmid":"28472606","publisher":" NRC Research Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural Biotechnology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"A simple and efficient non-denaturing FISH method for maize chromosome differentiation using single-strand oligonucleotide probes","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/simple-efficient-nondenaturing-fish-method-maize-chromosome-differentiation-using-singlestrand-oligo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8403724,"mean":7.0757025513494,"rank":7263537,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8403724,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237168,"mean":12.9308059047,"rank":194033,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237168,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":550,"mean":2.7729726775956,"rank":373,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":550,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":2.6561538461538,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
