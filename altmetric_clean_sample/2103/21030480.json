However, their high error rate significantly complicates assembly and requires expensive correction steps to layout the reads using standard assembly engines.\nWe present an original and efficient spectral algorithm to layout the uncorrected nanopore reads, and its seamless integration into a straightforward overlap\/layout\/consensus (OLC) assembly scheme. The method is shown to assemble Oxford Nanopore reads from several bacterial genomes into good quality (~99% identity to the reference) genome-sized contigs, while yielding more fragmented assemblies from the eukaryotic microbe Sacharomyces cerevisiae .\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/antrec\/spectrassembler.\nantoine.recanati@inria.fr.\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023d2","authors":["Antoine Recanati","Thomas Br\u00fcls","Alexandre d'Aspremont"],"doi":"10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btx370","first_seen_on":"2017-06-13T10:01:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1367-4803","1460-2059","1367-4811"],"journal":"Bioinformatics","last_mentioned_on":1497348070,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28605450?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28605450","pubdate":"2017-06-13T22:01:08+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Mathematics","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["computationalbiology"],"title":"A spectral algorithm for fast de novo layout of uncorrected long nanopore reads","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/spectral-algorithm-fast-novo-layout-uncorrected-long-nanopore-reads"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8360145,"mean":7.0505745135414,"rank":6344239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1133266,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8360145,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241800,"mean":12.626700598431,"rank":171213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241800,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5749,"mean":6.8173928322895,"rank":5152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5749,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146,"mean":7.0100551724138,"rank":121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
