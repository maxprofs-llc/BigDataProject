These eleven metal ions are arranged in a peculiar structural motif, where Zn4 is located at the peripheral shell wrapping Ln7 in the inner core. The Zn ions are penta-coordinate in all cases, linked to the NO2 donor atoms from the L(2-) ligand and to a hydroxyl group, and the apical position is occupied by a chloride anion. All Ln(III) ions in these systems are octa-coordinate with LnO8 and LnNO7 coordination spheres. Magnetocaloric effect (MCE) behavior has been found in the Gd analogue due to multiple low lying excited states arising from antiferromagnetic Gd-Gd exchange interactions. The Dy derivative shows frequency dependent out-of-phase signals indicating the presence of slow relaxation of magnetization below 8 K under zero applied direct current (dc) field, but without reaching a maximum, which is due to a faster quantum tunneling relaxation. The effective barrier extracted from the frequency dependent data is Ueff = 11.2 K and a \u03c40 of 4.18 \u00d7 10(-6) s.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Hongshan Ke","Xiaohua Lu","Wen Wei","Wenyuan Wang","Gang Xie","Sanping Chen"],"doi":"10.1039\/c7dt01501a","first_seen_on":"2017-06-13T11:59:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1477-9226","1477-9234"],"journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1497355147,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2017\/DT\/C7DT01501A?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=inorganicnews"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2017\/dt\/c7dt01501a","pmid":"28607994","pubdate":"2017-06-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Unusual undecanuclear heterobimetallic Zn4Ln7 (Ln = Gd, Dy) nano-sized clusters encapsulating two peroxide anions through spontaneous intake of dioxygen","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/unusual-undecanuclear-heterobimetallic-zn-4-ln-7-ln-gd-dy-nanosized-clusters-encapsulating-two-perox"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8360145,"mean":7.0505745135414,"rank":7226981,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8360145,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241800,"mean":12.626671855549,"rank":197423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241800,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11320,"mean":0.7021081367612,"rank":3221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11320,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":368,"mean":1.0599455040872,"rank":144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":368,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
