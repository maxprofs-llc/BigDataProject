Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests were used to test the effect of nipple type on both outcomes.\nPrefeeding minute ventilation decreased significantly during suck bursts and returned to baseline values during suck burst breaks across both slow-flow and standard-flow nipples. No differences were found in minute ventilation (p > .40) or overall milk transfer (p = .58) between slow-flow and standard-flow nipples.\nThe lack of difference in primary outcomes between the single-use slow-flow and standard-flow nipples may reflect variability in nipple properties among nipples produced by the same manufacturer. Future investigations examining the effect of both single-use and reusable nipple products are warranted to better guide nipple selection during clinical care.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000221d","authors":["Katlyn E.
