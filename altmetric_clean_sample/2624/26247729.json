We know that most traits are strongly heritable. However, their genetic architecture is a long-standing question, which is unfortunately confounded by the lack of complete knowledge of the genetic components as well as their phenotypic effect in a specific genetic background. Many genetic variants are known to affect phenotypes but the same functional variant can have a different effect on the phenotype in different individuals of the same species. Understanding the impact of genetic background on the expressivity of a given phenotype is essential because this effect complicates our ability to predict phenotype from genotype. Here, we briefly review recent progress on the exploration of the effect of genetic background and we discuss how a deeper characterization of the inheritance, expressivity and genetic interactions hidden behind the phenotypic landscape of natural variation could provide a better understanding of the relationship between genotype and phenotype.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a3","authors":["T\u00e9o Fournier","Joseph Schacherer"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.gde.2017.08.009","first_seen_on":"2017-09-18T19:17:07+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms"],"handles":[],"issns":["0959437X","1879-0380"],"journal":"Current Opinion in Genetics & Development","last_mentioned_on":1505762215,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0959437X1730059X"],"pmid":"28915487","pubdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Genetic backgrounds and hidden trait complexity in natural populations","type":"article","volume":"47","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genetic-backgrounds-hidden-trait-complexity-natural-populations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0.5,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8430718,"mean":7.0909734033215,"rank":6396685,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1146162,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8430718,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110746,"mean":11.820780242901,"rank":77996,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":20437,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110746,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":760,"mean":3.7676363636364,"rank":603,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":760,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":2.9263157894737,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
