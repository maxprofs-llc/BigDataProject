However, the greatest anti-ischaemic benefit of potent antiplatelet drugs over the less potent clopidogrel occurs early, while most excess bleeding events arise during chronic treatment. Hence, a stage-adapted treatment with potent platelet inhibition in the acute phase and de-escalation to clopidogrel in the maintenance phase could be an alternative approach. We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of early de-escalation of antiplatelet treatment from prasugrel to clopidogrel guided by platelet function testing (PFT).\nIn this investigator-initiated, randomised, open-label, assessor-blinded, multicentre trial (TROPICAL-ACS) done at 33 sites in Europe, patients were enrolled if they had biomarker-positive acute coronary syndrome with successful PCI and a planned duration of dual antiplatelet treatment of 12 months. Enrolled patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using an internet-based randomisation procedure with a computer-generated block randomisation with stratification across study sites to either standard treatment with prasugrel for 12 months (control group) or a step-down regimen (1 week prasugrel followed by 1 week clopidogrel and PFT-guided maintenance therapy with clopidogrel or prasugrel from day 14 after hospital discharge; guided de-escalation group). The assessors were masked to the treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was net clinical benefit (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke or bleeding grade 2 or higher according to Bleeding Academic Research Consortium [BARC]) criteria) 1 year after randomisation (non-inferiority hypothesis; margin of 30%). Analysis was intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01959451, and EudraCT, 2013-001636-22.\nBetween Dec 2, 2013, and May 20, 2016, 2610 patients were assigned to study groups; 1304 to the guided de-escalation group and 1306 to the control group. The primary endpoint occurred in 95 patients (7%) in the guided de-escalation group and in 118 patients (9%) in the control group (pnon-inferiority=0\u00b70004; hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b781 [95% CI 0\u00b762-1\u00b706], psuperiority=0\u00b712). Despite early de-escalation, there was no increase in the combined risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke in the de-escalation group (32 patients [3%]) versus in the control group (42 patients [3%]; pnon-inferiority=0\u00b70115). There were 64 BARC 2 or higher bleeding events (5%) in the de-escalation group versus 79 events (6%) in the control group (HR 0\u00b782 [95% CI 0\u00b759-1\u00b713]; p=0\u00b723).\nGuided de-escalation of antiplatelet treatment was non-inferior to standard treatment with prasugrel at 1 year after PCI in terms of net clinical benefit. Our trial shows that early de-escalation of antiplatelet treatment can be considered as an alternative approach in patients with acute coronary syndrome managed with PCI.\nKlinikum der Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Roche Diagnostics, Eli Lilly, and Daiichi Sankyo.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008b2a","authors":["Sibbing, Dirk","Aradi, D\u00e1niel","Jacobshagen, Claudius","Gross, Lisa","Trenk, Dietmar","Geisler, Tobias","Orban, Martin","Hadamitzky, Martin","Merkely, B\u00e9la","Kiss, R\u00f3bert G\u00e1bor","Kom\u00f3csi, Andr\u00e1s","D\u00e9zsi, Csaba A","Holdt, Lesca","Felix, Stephan B","Parma, Radoslaw","Klopotowski, Mariusz","Schwinger, Robert H G","Rieber, Johannes","Huber, Kurt","Neumann, Franz-Josef","Koltowski, Lukasz","Mehilli, Julinda","Huczek, Zenon","Massberg, Steffen","Parma, Zofia","Lesiak, Maciej","Komosa, Anna","Kowara, Michal","Rymuza, Bartosz","Malek, Lukasz","Aradi, Daniel","Veress, G\u00e1bor","D\u00e9zsi, Andr\u00e1s D\u00f6me","Lux, \u00c1rp\u00e1d","Papp, Judit","Kov\u00e1cs, Andrea","D\u00e9zsi, Csaba Andr\u00e1s","Amer, Sayour","Ruzsa, Zolt\u00e1n","R\u00f3na, Szil\u00e1rd","Ili, Ren\u00e1ta","Ungi, Imre","Nagy, Ferenc","Zweiker, Robert","T\u00f3th-Gayor, G\u00e1bor","Haller, Paul","von Scheidt, Wolfgang","Bl\u00fcthgen, Andreas","Leggewie, Stefan","Kreider-Stempfle, Hans Ulrich","Remp, Thomas","Kara, Kaffer","M\u00fcgge, Andreas","Wutzler, Alexander","Fichtlscherer, Stephan","Zeiher, Andreas M.","Seeger, Florian","Hinterseer, Martin","K\u00f6nig, Andreas","Lederle, Susanne","Czepluch, Frauke","Maier, Lars","Schillinger, Wolfgang","Sossalla, Samuel","Hummel, Astrid","Felix, Stephan","Karakas, Mahir","Sydow, Karsten","Rudolph, Tanja","Halbach, Marcel","Gori, Tommaso","M\u00fcnzel, Thomas","May, Andreas","Gerstenberg, Carsten-Manuel","Pilecky, David","Deichstetter, Markus","K\u00e4\u00e4b, Stefan","L\u00f6w, Anja","Orban, Matthias","Sattler, Stefan","Deuschl, Sabine","Teupser, Daniel","Mudra, Harald","R\u00e4der, Thomas","Sch\u00fctz, Torsten","Vahldiek, Felix","Divchev, Dimitar","Ince, H\u00fcseyin","Nienaber, Christoph A","Radunski, Henning","Boekstegers, Peter","Horstkotte, Jan","Mueller, Ralf","M\u00fcller, Karin","Schwinger, Robert","Rasp, Oliver","Dirk Sibbing","D\u00e1niel Aradi","Claudius Jacobshagen","Lisa Gross","Dietmar Trenk","Tobias Geisler","Martin Orban","Martin Hadamitzky","B\u00e9la Merkely","R\u00f3bert G\u00e1bor Kiss","Andr\u00e1s Kom\u00f3csi","Csaba A D\u00e9zsi","Lesca Holdt","Stephan B Felix","Radoslaw Parma","Mariusz Klopotowski","Robert H G Schwinger","Johannes Rieber","Kurt Huber","Franz-Josef Neumann","Lukasz Koltowski","Julinda Mehilli","Zenon Huczek","Steffen Massberg","Zofia Parma","Maciej Lesiak","Anna Komosa","Michal Kowara","Bartosz Rymuza","Lukasz Malek","Daniel Aradi","G\u00e1bor Veress","Andr\u00e1s D\u00f6me D\u00e9zsi","\u00c1rp\u00e1d Lux","Judit Papp","Andrea Kov\u00e1cs","Csaba Andr\u00e1s D\u00e9zsi","Sayour Amer","Zolt\u00e1n Ruzsa","Szil\u00e1rd R\u00f3na","Ren\u00e1ta Ili","Imre Ungi","Ferenc Nagy","Robert Zweiker","G\u00e1bor T\u00f3th-Gayor","Paul Haller","Wolfgang von Scheidt","Andreas Bl\u00fcthgen","Stefan Leggewie","Hans Ulrich Kreider-Stempfle","Thomas Remp","Kaffer Kara","Andreas M\u00fcgge","Alexander Wutzler","Stephan Fichtlscherer","Andreas M.
