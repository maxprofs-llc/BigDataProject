Because a species' mating system is known to have a considerable effect on within-population pollen movement, the extent of fine-scale spatial genetic structure (SGS) can be expected to differ between populations located at different parts of their geographical range. To test this prediction, we compared the fine-scale SGS between two core and two disjunct populations of the distylous forest herb Pulmonaria officinalis. Because in disjunct populations of this species the heteromorphic self-incompatibility system showed relaxation in the long-styled morph, but not in the short-styled morph, we also hypothesized that the extent of fine-scale SGS and clustering differed between morphs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b8","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2156-14-101","first_seen_on":"2013-10-18T14:20:48+00:00","issns":["1471-2156"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1382106041,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2156\/14\/101\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2156-14-101.pdf","pmid":"24134743","pubdate":"2013-10-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"101","subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"Differences in fine-scale spatial genetic structure across the distribution range of the distylous forest herb Pulmonaria officinalis (Boraginaceae)","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/differences-finescale-spatial-genetic-structure-across-distribution-range-distylous-forest-herb-pulm-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628445,"mean":4.9414395978041,"rank":2903601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75998,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628445,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95036,"mean":7.678317272584,"rank":75518,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":328,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95036,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":383,"mean":3.1194502617801,"rank":294,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":383,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":3.2305555555556,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
