Because of the lower symmetry of each constituent monolayer, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) allows more structural variations in multiple layers than graphene; however, the structure-property relationships in this system remain largely unexplored. Here, we report a strong correlation between the interlayer stacking structures and optical and topological properties in chemically grown h-BN bilayers, measured mainly by using dark-field transmission electron microscopy (DF-TEM) and optical second harmonic generation (SHG) mapping. Our data show that there exist two distinct h-BN bilayer structures with different interlayer symmetries that give rise to a distinct difference in their SHG intensities. In particular, the SHG signal in h-BN bilayers is observed only for structures with broken inversion symmetry, with an intensity much larger than that of single layer h-BN. In addition, our DF-TEM data identify the formation of interlayer topological defects in h-BN bilayers, likely induced by local strain, whose properties are determined by the interlayer symmetry and the different interlayer potential landscapes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003145","authors":["Cheol-Joo Kim","Lola Brown","Matt W.
