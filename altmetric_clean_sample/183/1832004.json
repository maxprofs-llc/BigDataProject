However, recent findings on cuttlefish and octopi showed that exposure to artificial noise had a direct consequence on the functionality and physiology of the statocysts, sensory organs, which are responsible for their equilibrium and movements in the water column. Owing to a lack of available data on deep diving cephalopod species, we conducted a noise exposure comparative experiment on one Mediterranean squid, Illex coindetii, and on the European squid Loligo vulgaris. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed similar injuries in the inner structure of the statocysts, as those found in cuttlefish and octopi. In addition to the ultrastructural description of the lesions, we publish here the first images of the crista-cupula system and inner statocyst cavity of I. coindetii.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Marta Sol\u00e9","Marc Lenoir","Merc\u00e8 Durfort","Manel L\u00f3pez-Bejar","Antoni Lombarte","Michel Andr\u00e9"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0078825","first_seen_on":"2013-10-16T19:19:09+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"10","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1438345830,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0078825","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0078825"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0078825.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3797068","pmid":"24143265","pubdate":"2013-10-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e78825","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Ultrastructural Damage of Loligo vulgaris and Illex coindetii statocysts after Low Frequency Sound Exposure","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ultrastructural-damage-loligo-vulgaris-illex-coindetii-statocysts-after-low-frequency-sound-exposure"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8010881,"mean":6.7670060555098,"rank":1913732,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6059189,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8010881,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":142896,"mean":6.9878107141609,"rank":35105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":107076,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":142896,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111598,"mean":10.449144009248,"rank":35234,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":75461,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111598,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3955,"mean":12.930171977744,"rank":1358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2568,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3955,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
