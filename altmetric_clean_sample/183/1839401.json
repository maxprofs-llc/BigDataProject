Tests were carried out at town-located cemeteries in Opole and Grodk\u00f3w (southern Poland) and, as a benchmark, at the centres of those same towns. The purpose of the study was to estimate BTEXS emissions caused by the candle burning and, equally important to examine, whether emissions generated by the tested sources were similar to the BTEXS emissions generated by road transport. During the festive period, significant increases in benzene concentrations, by 200 % and 144 %, were noted at the cemeteries in Opole and Grodk\u00f3w, as well as in toluene, by 366 % and 342 %, respectively. Styrene concentrations also increased. It was demonstrated that the ratio of toluene to benzene concentrations from emissions caused by the burning candles are comparable to the ratio established for transportation emissions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f61000649f","authors":["Tomasz Olszowski","Andrzej K\u00c5\u0082os","Andrzej K\u0142os"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00128-013-1104-6","first_seen_on":"2013-10-18T12:49:05+00:00","issns":["1432-0800","0007-4861"],"journal":"Bulletin of Environmental Contamination & Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1382100104,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00128-013-1104-6"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00128-013-1104-6.pdf","pmid":"24052143","pubdate":"2013-09-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ecotoxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pollution, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Soil Science & Conservation","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Waste Water Technology \/ Water Pollution Control \/ Water Management \/ Aquatic Pollution","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"The Impact of Candle Burning During All Saints\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Day Ceremonies on Ambient Alkyl-Substituted Benzene Concentrations","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-candle-burning-during-saints-day-ceremonies-ambient-alkylsubstituted-benzene-concentrations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6230503,"mean":5.96748679288,"rank":2927153,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1858787,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6230503,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112679,"mean":7.8913863043364,"rank":55979,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":41987,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112679,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":772,"mean":1.6737535667964,"rank":252,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":473,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":772,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":1.8852941176471,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Computer Science":1,"Environmental Science":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/rheijdendael\/status\/391182305416339456","license":"public","citation_ids":[1839401],"posted_on":"2013-10-18T12:41:44+00:00","author":{"name":"Riny Heijdendael","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1312526717\/rinyheads_skype_bluesquare_normal.jpg","description":"Global sustainability from behind your screen : easy.
