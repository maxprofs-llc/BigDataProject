In depleted fibres, poisoned with 10 \u03bcM cyclopiazonic acid SOCE influx was about 3 \u03bcM\/s. Ryanodine (50 \u03bcM) caused a robust, nifedipine (50 \u03bcM) independent, increase in SOCE activation to 8.6 \u03bcM\/s. Decreasing medium osmolarity from 300 to 220 mOsm\/L, decreased SOCE to 0.9 \u03bcM\/s, while increasing osmolarity from 220 to 400 mOsm\/L potentiated SOCE to 43.6 \u03bcM\/s. Ryanodine inhibited the effects of hypotonicity. Experiments using 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, nifedipine, or Mn(2+) quenching, strongly suggest that the increased [Ca(2+)](myo) by ryanodine or hypertonic shock is mediated by potentiated SOCE activation. The Ca(2+) response decay, quantified by d[Ca(2+)](Removal)\/dt, indicates a robust residual Ca(2+) removal mechanism in sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase poisoned fibres. SOCE high sensitivity to osmotic shocks, or to ryanodine receptor (RyR) binding, suggests its high dependency on the structural relationship between its molecular constituents, Orai1 and stromal interaction molecule and the sarcoplasmic reticulum and plasma membranes, in the triadic junctional region, where RyRs, are conspicuously present. This study demonstrates that SOCE machinery is highly sensitive to structural changes caused by binding of an agonist to its receptor or by imposed osmotical volume changes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d77","authors":["Pura Bola\u00c3\u00b1os","Alis Guillen","Adriana G\u00c3\u00a1mez","Carlo Caputo","Pura Bola\u00f1os","Adriana G\u00e1mez"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10974-013-9360-y","first_seen_on":"2013-10-17T12:24:45+00:00","issns":["1573-2657","0142-4319"],"journal":"Journal of Muscle Research and Cell Motility","last_mentioned_on":1382005778,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s10974-013-9360-y"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10974-013-9360-y.pdf","pmid":"24129906","pubdate":"2013-10-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Anatomy \/ Morphology \/ Histology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Proteomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","physiology"],"title":"Quantifying SOCE fluorescence measurements in mammalian muscle fibres.
