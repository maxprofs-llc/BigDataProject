To investigate the potential utility of molecular markers in studying sex chromosome differentiation at early stages of their divergence, we examined the levels and patterns of genetic differentiation between sex chromosomes in nine-spined (Pungitius pungitius) and three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) using microsatellite markers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b9","authors":["Takahito Shikano","Heini M Natri","Yukinori Shimada","Juha Meril\u00e4","Shikano T","Natri HM","Shimada Y","Meril\u00e4 J"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2164-12-474","first_seen_on":"2013-10-16T20:56:41+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1471-2164",""],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1324646070,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1471-2164-12-474"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/1471-2164-12-474?site=bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com","pmcid":"PMC3201943","pmid":"21958112","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microarrays","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Genetics & Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Proteomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"474","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"High degree of sex chromosome differentiation in stickleback fishes","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/high-degree-sex-chromosome-differentiation-stickleback-fishes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.104,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.104},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685046,"mean":4.9228975163162,"rank":588942,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":3095477,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685046,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95670,"mean":7.5767124146799,"rank":18724,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":76945,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95670,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3389,"mean":3.303126918536,"rank":521,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":2867,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3389,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":202,"mean":3.2814029850746,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":202,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
