While peroxisomes oxidize specific carboxylic acids such as very long-chain fatty acids, branched-chain fatty acids, bile acids, and fatty dicarboxylic acids, mitochondria oxidize long-, medium-, and short-chain fatty acids. Oxidation of long-chain substrates requires the carnitine shuttle for mitochondrial access but medium-chain fatty acid oxidation is generally considered carnitine-independent. Using control and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2)- and carnitine\/acylcarnitine translocase (CACT)-deficient human fibroblasts, we investigated the oxidation of lauric acid (C12:0). Measurement of the acylcarnitine profile in the extracellular medium revealed significantly elevated levels of extracellular C10- and C12-carnitine in CPT2- and CACT-deficient fibroblasts. The accumulation of C12-carnitine indicates that lauric acid also uses the carnitine shuttle to access mitochondria. Moreover, the accumulation of extracellular C10-carnitine in CPT2- and CACT-deficient cells suggests an extramitochondrial pathway for the oxidation of lauric acid. Indeed, in the absence of peroxisomes C10-carnitine is not produced, proving that this intermediate is a product of peroxisomal \u03b2-oxidation. In conclusion, when the carnitine shuttle is impaired lauric acid is partly oxidized in peroxisomes. This peroxisomal oxidation could be a compensatory mechanism to metabolize straight medium- and long-chain fatty acids, especially in cases of mitochondrial fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation deficiency or overload.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c38","authors":["Sara Violante","Lodewijk Ijlst","Heleen Te Brinke","Janet Koster","Isabel Tavares de Almeida","Ronald J A Wanders","F\u00e1tima V Ventura","Sander M Houten"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbalip.2013.06.007","first_seen_on":"2013-10-18T10:14:09+00:00","issns":["0006-3002"],"issue":"9","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA)","last_mentioned_on":1382091213,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23850792?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23850792","pubdate":"2013-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Peroxisomes contribute to the acylcarnitine production when the carnitine shuttle is deficient.","type":"article","volume":"1831","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/peroxisomes-contribute-acylcarnitine-production-carnitine-shuttle-deficient"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626012,"mean":4.9497445252532,"rank":2749407,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":719077,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626012,"percentile":19},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94933,"mean":7.7079633000465,"rank":71327,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":19376,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94933,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3852,"mean":2.5425868605557,"rank":3080,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":689,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3852,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":4.5137878787879,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
