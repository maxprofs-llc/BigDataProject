The status of various alloy systems, including AB\u2085, AB\u2082, A\u2082B\u2087-type, Ti-Ni-based, Mg-Ni-based, BCC, and Zr-Ni-based metal hydride alloys, for their most important electrochemical application, the nickel metal hydride battery, is summarized. Other electrochemical applications, such as Ni-hydrogen, fuel cell, Li-ion battery, air-metal hydride, and hybrid battery systems, also have been mentioned.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f6100041bc","authors":["Kwo-hsiung Young"],"doi":"10.3390\/ma6104574","first_seen_on":"2013-10-17T18:07:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1996-1944"],"issue":"10","journal":"Materials (1996-1944)","last_mentioned_on":1382033167,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1996-1944\/6\/10\/4574"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1996-1944\/6\/10\/4574\/pdf","pmid":"28788349","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"title":"The Current Status of Hydrogen Storage Alloy Development for Electrochemical Applications","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/current-status-hydrogen-storage-alloy-development-electrochemical-applications"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505402,"mean":5.1012628106873,"rank":2354423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1473768,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505402,"percentile":32},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101079,"mean":7.6808600684621,"rank":51855,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":30051,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101079,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103,"mean":1.5575294117647,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
