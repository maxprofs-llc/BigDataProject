In clinical trials, immunologic responses have been observed, however responses may be muted by inhibitory pathways. The PD1\/PDL1 pathway is an important element contributing to tumor-mediated immune suppression. In this study, we demonstrate that myeloma cells and DC\/tumor fusions strongly express PD-L1. Compared with a control population of normal volunteers, increased PD-1 expression was observed on T cells isolated from patients with myeloma. It is interesting to note that after autologous transplantation, T-cell expression of PD-1 returned to levels seen in normal controls. We examined the effect of PD-1 blockade on T-cell response to DC\/tumor fusions ex vivo. Presence of CT-011, an anti-PD1 antibody, promoted the vaccine-induced T-cell polarization towards an activated phenotype expressing Th1 compared with Th2 cytokines. A concomitant decrease in regulatory T cells and enhanced killing in a cytotoxicity assay was observed. In summary, we demonstrate that PD-1 expression is increased in T cells of patients with active myeloma, and that CT-011 enhances activated T-cell responses after DC\/tumor fusion stimulation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cc8","authors":["Jacalyn Rosenblatt","Brett Glotzbecker","Heidi Mills","Baldev Vasir","Dimitrios Tzachanis","James D Levine","Robin M Joyce","Kerry Wellenstein","Whitney Keefe","Michael Schickler","Rinat Rotem-Yehudar","Donald Kufe","David Avigan","Rosenblatt J","Glotzbecker B","Mills H","Vasir B","Tzachanis D","Levine JD","Joyce RM","Wellenstein K","Keefe W","Schickler M","Rotem-Yehudar R","Kufe D","Avigan D"],"doi":"10.1097\/cji.0b013e31821ca6ce","endpage":"418","first_seen_on":"2013-10-17T18:27:56+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1537-4513","1524-9557"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Immunotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1382034409,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21577144?dopt=Citation"],"pmcid":"PMC3142955","pmid":"21577144","pubdate":"2011-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"409","subjects":["neoplasms","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"PD-1 blockade by CT-011, anti-PD-1 antibody, enhances ex vivo T-cell responses to autologous dendritic cell\/myeloma fusion vaccine.","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pd1-blockade-ct011-antipd1-antibody-enhances-ex-vivo-tcell-responses-autologous-dendritic-cellmyelom"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6561399,"mean":6.0801636599394,"rank":4853398,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":964134,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6561399,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116148,"mean":7.7931857904209,"rank":77225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":20542,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116148,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":436,"mean":1.5150666666667,"rank":170,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":436,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.4375,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":29,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
