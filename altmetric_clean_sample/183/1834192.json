In recent years, studies of genetic diseases in which LRO functions are compromised have provided new insights into the mechanisms of LRO biogenesis and the regulated secretion of LRO contents. These insights have revealed previously unappreciated specialized endosomal sorting processes in all cell types, and are expanding our views of the plasticity of the endosomal and secretory systems in adapting to cell type-specific needs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a0","authors":["Michael S Marks","Harry FG Heijnen","Gra\u00e7a Raposo"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ceb.2013.04.008","endpage":"505","first_seen_on":"2013-10-17T00:18:06+00:00","funders":["niaid","niams","nhlbi"],"issns":["09550674"],"issue":"4","journal":"Current Opinion in Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1369801690,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0955067413000719"],"pmid":"23726022","pubdate":"2013-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"495","title":"Lysosome-related organelles: unusual compartments become mainstream","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lysosomerelated-organelles-unusual-compartments-become-mainstream"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5055195,"mean":5.9788747070846,"rank":3548222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":850324,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5055195,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106938,"mean":7.8292169595183,"rank":70966,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":19315,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106938,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":522,"mean":2.5970863723608,"rank":420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":522,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.75,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":23,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
