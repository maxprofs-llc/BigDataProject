To examine functional limits in task complexity, we examine the phenomenon of goal neglect, where participants with low fluid intelligence fail to follow task rules that they otherwise understand. Though neglect is known to increase with task complexity, here we show that - in contrast to previous accounts - the critical factor is not the total complexity of all task rules. Instead, when the space of task requirements can be divided into separate sub-parts, neglect is controlled by the complexity of each component part. The data also show that neglect develops and stabilizes over the first few performance trials, i.e. as instructions are first used to generate behaviour. In all complex behaviour, a critical process is combination of task events with retrieved task requirements to create focused attentional episodes dealing with each decision in turn. In large part, we suggest, fluid intelligence may reflect this process of converting complex requirements into effective attentional episodes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002589","authors":["Apoorva Bhandari","John Duncan","Bhandari A","Duncan J"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cognition.2013.08.013","endpage":"30","first_seen_on":"2013-10-18T08:24:58+00:00","funders":["mrc"],"issns":["00100277","0010-0277"],"issue":"1","journal":"Cognition","last_mentioned_on":1405084159,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0010027713001704"],"pmid":"24141034","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Language, Communication And Culture","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"11","title":"Goal neglect and knowledge chunking in the construction of novel behaviour ","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0010027713001704","volume":"130","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/goal-neglect-knowledge-chunking-construction-novel-behaviour"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.624,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.624},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8348397,"mean":7.0409473841366,"rank":911159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7437281,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8348397,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145108,"mean":7.0915885105476,"rank":16878,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":128223,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145108,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1683,"mean":12.911520808561,"rank":431,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":1252,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1683,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":9.7423703703704,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
