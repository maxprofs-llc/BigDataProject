However, the pathogenesis of this complication has not yet been elucidated. Therefore, we identified the pre-transplant risk factors for the development of COP\/BOOP using the Japan transplant registry database between 2005 and 2009. Among 9550 eligible recipients, 193 experienced COP\/BOOP (2%). HLA disparity (odds ratio (OR) 1.51, P=0.05), female-to-male HCT (OR 1.53, P=0.023), and PBSC transplant (OR 1.84, P=0.0076) were significantly associated with an increased risk of COP\/BOOP. On the other hand, BU-based myeloablative conditioning (OR 0.52, P=0.033), or fludarabine-based reduced-intensity conditioning (OR 0.50, P=0.0011) in comparison with a TBI-based regimen and in vivo T-cell depletion (OR 0.46, P=0.055) were associated with a lower risk. Of the 193 patients with COP\/BOOP, 77 died, including non-relapse death in 46 (59%). Pulmonary failure and fatal infection accounted for 41% (n=19) and 26% (n=12) of the non-relapse death. Allogeneic immunity and conditioning toxicity could be associated with COP\/BOOP. Prospective studies are required to elucidate the true risk factors for COP\/BOOP and to develop a prophylactic approach.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002414","authors":["H Nakasone","M Onizuka","N Suzuki","N Fujii","S Taniguchi","K Kakihana","H Ogawa","K Miyamura","T Eto","H Sakamaki","H Yabe","Y Morishima","K Kato","R Suzuki","T Fukuda"],"doi":"10.1038\/bmt.2013.116","endpage":"1323","first_seen_on":"2013-10-17T17:21:27+00:00","issns":["0268-3369","1476-5365"],"issue":"10","journal":"Bone Marrow Transplantation","last_mentioned_on":1381795200,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/bmt.2013.116"],"pmid":"23933758","pubdate":"2013-08-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1317","title":"Pre-transplant risk factors for cryptogenic organizing pneumonia\/bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia after hematopoietic cell transplantation.","type":"article","volume":"48","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pretransplant-risk-factors-cryptogenic-organizing-pneumoniabronchiolitis-obliterans-organizing-pneum"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633792,"mean":4.9212574058383,"rank":2015187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":947234,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633792,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95036,"mean":7.6298925027624,"rank":49473,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":25420,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95036,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":673,"mean":3.4037738095238,"rank":371,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":673,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":1.6148148148148,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
