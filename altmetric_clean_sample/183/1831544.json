In order to determine which clinical, biochemical, and\/or hormonal parameters could be related to bone mineral density (BMD), 47 female AN patients were classified according to the WHO osteoporosis criteria at lumbar spine (LS). This was a cross-sectional study of 16 AN women with osteoporosis criteria and 31without. Control group was 25 healthy, normal-weight, age-matched women. We assessed BMD using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at the LS and body composition. We measured serum fasting cortisol, estradiol, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), leptin, sex hormone-binding globulin, albumin and retinol binding protein levels. The prevalence of osteoporosis was 34% and osteopenia 19% at the LS. The AN group with osteoporosis had lower IGF-1 and estradiol levels (both p<0.001), lower serum leptin (p<0.02), and higher cortisolemia (p<0.03) levels compared with AN group without osteoporosis. The BMD and T-score at LS was inversely related to the duration of amenorrhea (p<0.02) and directly related to body mass index (BMI, p<0.002), total fat mass (p<0.03), serum IGF-1 (p<0.01), and estradiol levels (p<0.001) in AN patients. We conclude that AN women with a significant BMD loss have a high risk of developing osteoporosis. A low BMD is a consequence of hormonal alterations which include hypoestrogenism, hypoleptinemia, hypercortisolism, and decreases in IGF-1 levels, as well as a low BMI and fat mass.","abstract_source":"pubmed","aggregated_in":[],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6803cf058f6100098be","authors":["Fern\u00e1ndez-Soto, Mar\u00eda Luisa","Gonz\u00e1lez-Jim\u00e9nez, Amalia","Chamorro-Fern\u00e1ndez, Marta","Leyva-Mart\u00ednez, Socorro"],"book":{"isbns":["9780124104730"]},"doi":"10.1016\/b978-0-12-410473-0.00010-6","first_seen_on":"2013-10-16T18:18:53+00:00","issns":["0083-6729","00836729"],"journal":"Vitamins & Hormones","last_mentioned_on":1366727423,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/B9780124104730000106"],"pmid":"23601428","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["endocrinology","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Clinical and Hormonal Variables Related to Bone Mass Loss in Anorexia Nervosa Patients","type":"chapter","volume":"92","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-hormonal-variables-related-bone-mass-loss-anorexia-nervosa-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5028713,"mean":5.9653160399705,"rank":1998046,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":2993936,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5028713,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106689,"mean":7.8158973455312,"rank":36436,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":69449,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106689,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":183,"mean":2.0743846153846,"rank":76,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":183,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
