With crystal and cryo-EM structures giving an atomic level view of coat architecture, current advances in the field have focused on understanding how the coat adapts to the different geometries of the underlying cargo. Combined with a growing appreciation for the specific roles of individual COPII paralogs in diverse aspects of mammalian physiology, the field is poised to understand how coat assembly and post-translational modification permits structural rigidity but geometric flexibility to handle the diverse cargoes that exit the ER.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a0","authors":["Elizabeth A Miller","Randy Schekman"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ceb.2013.04.005","endpage":"427","first_seen_on":"2013-10-16T23:37:42+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["09550674"],"issue":"4","journal":"Current Opinion in Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1369067637,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0955067413000689"],"pmid":"23702145","pubdate":"2013-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"420","title":"COPII \u2014 a flexible vesicle formation system","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/copii-flexible-vesicle-formation-system"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5055195,"mean":5.9788747070846,"rank":3548221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":850324,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5055195,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106954,"mean":7.8091694295626,"rank":70870,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":19466,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106954,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":522,"mean":2.5970863723608,"rank":420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":522,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.75,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
