Three experimental diets: shea butter (S; 42% stearic acid), palm oil (P; 43% palmitic palmitic acid), and palm-kernel oil with high-oleic sunflower oil (ML; 10% myristic acid, 30% lauric acid) were served to 15 men for 3 wk each, separated by washout periods. Diet S compared with diet P resulted in significant reduction in plasma cholesterol (22%) LDL cholesterol (26%), apolipoprotein B (18%), HDL cholesterol (12%), apolipoprotein A-I (13%), and a 13% lower factor VII coagulant activity (P = 0.001). Similar differences were observed between diets S and ML. In conclusion, intake of shea butter high in stearic acid favorably affects blood lipids and factor VII coagulant activity in young men, compared with fats high in saturated fatty acids with 12-16 carbons.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005700","first_seen_on":"2012-05-18T14:28:11+00:00","issns":["1938-3207"],"journal":"American Journal of Clinical Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1337449519,"links":["http:\/\/www.ajcn.org\/content\/59\/2\/371.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ajcn.org\/content\/59\/2\/371.full.pdf","pmid":"8310987","pubdate":"1994-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Fat high in stearic acid favorably affects blood lipids and factor VII coagulant activity in comparison with fats high in palmitic acid or high in myristic and lauric acids.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fat-high-stearic-acid-favorably-affects-blood-lipids-factor-vii-coagulant-activity-comparison-fats-h"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627218,"mean":4.9497513377373,"rank":2018491,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":931959,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627218,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72937,"mean":4.3650691016781,"rank":32683,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":27231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72937,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4221,"mean":12.944817535545,"rank":3005,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":833,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4221,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":4.1125,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
