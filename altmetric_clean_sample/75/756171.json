FAD mutations increase the release of amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2)42 relative to A\u03b240 by an unknown, possibly gain-of-toxic-function, mechanism. However, many PSEN mutations paradoxically impair \u03b3-secretase and 'loss-of-function' mechanisms have also been postulated. Here, we use kinetic studies to demonstrate that FAD mutations affect A\u03b2 generation via three different mechanisms, resulting in qualitative changes in the A\u03b2 profiles, which are not limited to A\u03b242. Loss of \u025b-cleavage function is not generally observed among FAD mutants. On the other hand, \u03b3-secretase inhibitors used in the clinic appear to block the initial \u025b-cleavage step, but unexpectedly affect more selectively Notch than APP processing, while modulators act as activators of the carboxypeptidase-like (\u03b3) activity. Overall, we provide a coherent explanation for the effect of different FAD mutations, demonstrating the importance of qualitative rather than quantitative changes in the A\u03b2 products, and suggest fundamental improvements for current drug development efforts.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027b6","authors":["Ch\u00e1vez-Guti\u00e9rrez L","Bammens L","Benilova I","Vandersteen A","Benurwar M","Borgers M","Lismont S","Zhou L","Van Cleynenbreugel S","Esselmann H","Wiltfang J","Serneels L","Karran E","Gijsen H","Schymkowitz J","Rousseau F","Broersen K","De Strooper B"],"doi":"10.1038\/emboj.2012.79","first_seen_on":"2012-05-22T19:07:55+00:00","issns":["0261-4189"],"issue":"","journal":"EMBO Journal","last_mentioned_on":1500667322,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22505025","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3364747\/"],"pmid":"22505025","pubdate":"2012-04-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"The mechanism of \u03b3-Secretase dysfunction in familial Alzheimer disease.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mechanism-%CE%B3secretase-dysfunction-familial-alzheimer-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":16.582,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":7,"3m":7,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":16.582},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8250684,"mean":6.9709404952229,"rank":514972,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7735879,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8250684,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94233,"mean":5.5223877026912,"rank":5483,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":88750,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94233,"percentile":94},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4489,"mean":5.3442575757576,"rank":208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":4281,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4489,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":1.8368196721311,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":61,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":98}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":15,"Researcher":38,"Student  > Ph.
