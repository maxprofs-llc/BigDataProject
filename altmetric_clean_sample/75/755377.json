By incorporating an aldehyde motif genetically into a protein and improving the labeling kinetics substantially under mild conditions, we achieved fast, site-specific labeling of a protein with \u223c100% efficiency while maintaining the biological function. We show that an aldehyde-tagged protein can be specifically labeled in cell extracts without protein purification and then can be used in single-molecule pull-down analysis. We also show the unique power of our method in single-molecule studies on the transient interactions and switching between two quantitatively labeled DNA polymerases on their processivity factor.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000426c","authors":["Xinghua Shi","Yonil Jung","Li-Jung Lin","Cheng Liu","Cong Wu","Isaac K O Cann","Taekjip Ha"],"doi":"10.1038\/nmeth.1954","endpage":"503","first_seen_on":"2012-05-22T11:35:49+00:00","funders":["niaid","nigms"],"issns":["1548-7091","1548-7105"],"journal":"Nature Methods","last_mentioned_on":1339139110,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nmeth\/journal\/v9\/n5\/full\/nmeth.1954.html"],"pmid":"22466795","pubdate":"2012-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"499","subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques"],"title":"Quantitative fluorescence labeling of aldehyde-tagged proteins for single-molecule imaging","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quantitative-fluorescence-labeling-aldehydetagged-proteins-singlemolecule-imaging"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":3555347,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":834455,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77629,"mean":4.9858492296594,"rank":49727,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":14115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77629,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2322,"mean":16.876187850065,"rank":2118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":86,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2322,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85,"mean":10.897261904762,"rank":74,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":9,"Researcher":47,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
