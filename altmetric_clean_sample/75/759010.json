The polyoxometalate, Cs(3)[\u03b1-PW(11)O(39){cis-Pt(NH(3))(2)}(2)]\u00b78H(2)O (Cs-1), afforded by a stoichiometric reaction of mono-lacunary Keggin polyoxotungstate with cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(ii) in water, followed by crystallization from water, was obtained as analytically pure, homogeneous, yellow crystals. The compound Cs-1 was characterized by elemental analysis, thermogravimetric\/differential thermal analysis (TG\/DTA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and UV-visible spectroscopy, solution (1)H and (31)P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and X-ray crystallography. The single-crystal X-ray structure analysis revealed that the two cis-platinum(ii) moieties, [cis-Pt(NH(3))(2)](2+), were coordinated each to two oxygen atoms in a mono-vacant site of [\u03b1-PW(11)O(39)](7-) with asymmetric configuration, resulting in an overall C(1) symmetry. Furthermore, hydrogen evolution from an EDTA\u00b72Na (ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid disodium salt) aqueous solution under visible-light irradiation (\u2265400 nm) was achieved by using polyoxoanion 1 and titanium dioxide.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Chika Nozaki Kato","Yusuke Morii","Shota Hattori","Ryuta Nakayama","Yuki Makino","Hidemitsu Uno"],"doi":"10.1039\/c2dt30915g","first_seen_on":"2012-05-24T05:38:23+00:00","issns":["1477-9234","1477-9226"],"issue":"33","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1337837897,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlelanding\/2012\/dt\/c2dt30915g"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2012\/dt\/c2dt30915g","pmid":"22714024","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"10021","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Diplatinum(II)-coordinated Polyoxotungstate: Synthesis, Molecular Structure, and Photocatalytic Performance for Hydrogen Evolution from Water under Visible-light Irradiation","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diplatinumiicoordinated-polyoxotungstate-synthesis-molecular-structure-photocatalytic-performance-hy-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505992,"mean":5.1115236646191,"rank":3491224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":136127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505992,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75343,"mean":4.690234158902,"rank":56119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":615,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75343,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7985,"mean":1.1265445891784,"rank":6453,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7985,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/InorganicNews\/statuses\/205533154956673025","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[759010],"posted_on":"2012-05-24T05:38:17+00:00","author":{"name":"Inorganic News","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1636129253\/DSC01061_2_normal.JPG","description":"News, comments and publications about Inorganic Chemistry.","id_on_source":"InorganicNews","tweeter_id":"411132501","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1288},"tweet_id":"205533154956673025"}]}}
