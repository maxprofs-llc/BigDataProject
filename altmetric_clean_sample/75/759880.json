We found that RBP-J, the main nuclear transducer of signaling via Notch receptors, augmented Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-induced expression of key mediators of classically activated M1 macrophages and thus of innate immune responses to Listeria monocytogenes. Notch-RBP-J signaling controlled expression of the transcription factor IRF8 that induced downstream M1 macrophage-associated genes. RBP-J promoted the synthesis of IRF8 protein by selectively augmenting kinase IRAK2-dependent signaling via TLR4 to the kinase MNK1 and downstream translation-initiation control through eIF4E. Our results define a signaling network in which signaling via Notch-RBP-J and TLRs is integrated at the level of synthesis of IRF8 protein and identify a mechanism by which heterologous signaling pathways can regulate the TLR-induced inflammatory polarization of macrophages.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003165","authors":["Haixia Xu","Jimmy Zhu","Sinead Smith","Julia Foldi","Baohong Zhao","Allen Y Chung","Hasina Outtz","Jan Kitajewski","Chao Shi","Silvio Weber","Paul Saftig","Yueming Li","Keiko Ozato","Carl P Blobel","Lionel B Ivashkiv","Xiaoyu Hu"],"doi":"10.1038\/ni.2304","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2012-05-24T14:16:43+00:00","funders":["niaid","niams","nhlbi"],"issns":["1529-2908","1529-2916"],"journal":"Nature Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1348531200,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ni\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/ni.2304.html"],"pmid":"22610140","pubdate":"2012-05-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Notch-RBP-J signaling regulates the transcription factor IRF8 to promote inflammatory macrophage polarization","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/notchrbpj-signaling-regulates-transcription-factor-irf8-promote-inflammatory-macrophage-polarization"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":1929123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2536955,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75343,"mean":4.7497065647314,"rank":25720,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":48676,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75343,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1712,"mean":5.5875254237288,"rank":819,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":887,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1712,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":2.6846818181818,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":9,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":39,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
