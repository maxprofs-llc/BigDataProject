Studies on the biological activities of licochalcone E were in the initial stage. In the study, we demonstrated that licochalcone E has potent antimicrobial property against Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, via hemolysis, Western blot, and real-time RT-PCR assays, we have shown that subinhibitory concentrations of licochalcone E dosedependently reduces the production of alpha-toxin in both methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and methicillinresistant S. aureus (MRSA). The data suggest that licochalcone E may deserve further investigation as a potential therapeutic against S. aureus infections, or the structure of licochalcone E may be used as a basis for chemical synthesis of novel anti-S. aureus compounds.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa92d3cf058f61000de7c","authors":["Zhou T","Deng X","Qiu J"],"first_seen_on":"2012-05-19T13:25:56+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of microbiology and biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1337433494,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22573157?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22573157","pubdate":"2012-05-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology","microbiology"],"title":"Antimicrobial Activity of Licochalcone E Against Staphylococcus aureus and Its Impact on the Production of Staphylococcal Alpha-Toxin.","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antimicrobial-activity-licochalcone-e-against-staphylococcus-aureus-impact-production-staphylococcal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629240,"mean":4.9358355666342,"rank":2901388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":77798,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629240,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72942,"mean":4.3500764727656,"rank":52810,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":299,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72942,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179,"mean":1.0451797752809,"rank":85,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":0.58333333333333,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
