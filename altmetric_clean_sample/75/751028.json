The role of boron in living systems includes coordinated regulation of gene expression, growth and proliferation of higher plants and animals. There are several well-defined genes associated with boron transportation and tolerance in plants and these genes show close homology with human anion exchanger genes. Mutation of these genes also characterizes some genetic disorders. We investigated the toxic effects of boric acid on HEK293 cells and mRNA expression of anion exchanger (SLC4A1, SLC4A2 and SLC4A3) genes. Cytotoxicity of boric acid at different concentrations was tested by using the methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay. Gene expression profiles were examined using quantitative real-time PCR. In the HEK293 cells, the nontoxic upper concentration of boric acid was 250 \u03bcM; more than 500 \u03bcM caused cytotoxicity. The 250 \u03bcM boric acid concentration increased gene expression level of SLC4A2 up to 8.6-fold and SLC4A3 up to 2.6-fold, after 36-h incubation. There was no significant effect of boric acid on SLC4A1 mRNA expression levels.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f610007523","authors":["Akbas F","Aydin Z"],"doi":"10.4238\/2012.april.3.6","first_seen_on":"2012-05-18T20:19:12+00:00","issns":[""],"issue":"2","journal":"Genetics and Molecular Research","last_mentioned_on":1337371769,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22576912?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22576912","pubdate":"2012-05-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","genetics"],"title":"Boric acid increases the expression levels of human anion exchanger genes SLC4A2 and SLC4A3.","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/boric-acid-increases-expression-levels-human-anion-exchanger-genes-slc4a2-slc4a3-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506935,"mean":5.125739366827,"rank":3094837,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":972609,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506935,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75845,"mean":4.6495765254997,"rank":47845,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":17445,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75845,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":903,"mean":0.65274722838137,"rank":237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":511,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":903,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.0390434782609,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
