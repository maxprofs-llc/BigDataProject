However, evidence supporting its effect on women is still inconsistent. The aim of the study was to examine the hypertension risk related to road traffic noise in residential settings in an urban community amongst reproductive-aged women. Cross-sectional study data including 3,121 pregnant women, 20-45 years old, and a geographic information system (GIS) to assess the average road noise (LAeq 24 hr) for every subject at the current residential address were used. Effects on physician-diagnosed hypertension were estimated by logistic regression with adjustments for age, social status, marital status, education, alcohol consumption, ethnic group, parity, body mass index, chronic disease, and exposure duration. The prevalence of hypertension amongst women aged 20-45 years in the lowest exposure category was 13.1% in comparison to 13.6% and 18.1% amongst those exposed to the medium and the highest exposure category, respectively. After making adjustments for the selected variables, no exposure effects [Odds ratio (OR) \u2248 1.0] were noted in the medium exposure category [51-60 dB(A)]. However, a slight increase was noted in the highest exposure category [\u226561 dB(A)), OR 1.36; 95% CI 0.86-2.15]. The effect was more pronounced amongst women aged 30-45 years and a positive exposure-response relation was indicated for hypertension: An effect was seen at noise levels 51-60 dB(A) (OR = 1.03; 95% CI 0.72-1.49) and at >61 dB(A) (OR = 1.94, 95% CI 1.01-3.72). The present study shows some evidence for an association between the residential road traffic noise and hypertension amongst reproductive-aged women, and an exposure-response relationship.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5303cf058f6100042a0","authors":["Bendokiene"],"doi":"10.4103\/1463-1741.90288","first_seen_on":"2012-05-22T07:56:17+00:00","issns":["1463-1741"],"issue":"55","journal":"Noise & Health","last_mentioned_on":1337670643,"links":["http:\/\/noiseandhealth.org\/article.asp?issn=1463-1741;year=2011;volume=13;issue=55;spage=371;epage=377;aulast=Bendokiene;type=0"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.noiseandhealth.org\/article.asp?issn=1463-1741;year=2011;volume=13;issue=55;spage=371;epage=377;aulast=Bendokiene;type=2","pmid":"22122952","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medknow Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["audiology"],"title":"Risk of hypertension related to road traffic noise among reproductive-age women","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/risk-hypertension-related-road-traffic-noise-among-reproductiveage-women"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506977,"mean":5.1265981649798,"rank":2312594,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1572227,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506977,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75220,"mean":4.7066476555125,"rank":33813,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":30645,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75220,"percentile":40},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169,"mean":4.0602023809524,"rank":79,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.375,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
