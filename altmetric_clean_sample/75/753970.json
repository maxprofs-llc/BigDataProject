However, supraphysiological doses may cause suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. HPA axis suppression resulting in reduced cortisol response may cause an impaired stress response and an inadequate host defence against infections, which remains a cause of morbidity and death. The exact occurrence and duration of HPA axis suppression after glucocorticoid therapy for childhood ALL are unclear.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9123cf058f61000cc8c","authors":["Gordijn MS","Gemke RJ","van Dalen EC","Rotteveel J","Kaspers GJ"],"doi":"10.1002\/14651858.cd008727.pub2","first_seen_on":"2012-05-21T14:15:50+00:00","issns":["1465-1858",""],"journal":"Cochrane database of systematic reviews","last_mentioned_on":1337609544,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/14651858.CD008727.pub2\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/14651858.CD008727.pub2\/pdf","pmid":"22592733","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Hypothalamic\u00e2\u0080\u0090pituitary\u00e2\u0080\u0090adrenal (HPA) axis suppression after treatment with glucocorticoid therapy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal-hpa-axis-suppression-after-treatment-glucocorticoid-therapy-childhood-a-14"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633255,"mean":4.9221505741186,"rank":2015246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":946434,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633255,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72206,"mean":4.3539249082473,"rank":32347,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":27182,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72206,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6243,"mean":9.9643143223326,"rank":4913,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":745,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6243,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":7.1085121951219,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"NL":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/CCGCochrane\/status\/204575374229782530","citation_ids":[753970],"posted_on":"2012-05-21T14:12:24+00:00","author":{"name":"ChildhoodCancer","url":"http:\/\/www.childhoodcancer.cochrane.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/613621378386792448\/QcnG3gwb_normal.png","description":"Cochrane Childhood Cancer encourages and co-ordinates the production of systematic reviews on the effects of interventions in children & young adults","id_on_source":"CCGCochrane","tweeter_id":"128165779","geo":{"lt":52.37403,"ln":4.88969,"country":"NL"},"followers":507},"tweet_id":"204575374229782530"}]}}
