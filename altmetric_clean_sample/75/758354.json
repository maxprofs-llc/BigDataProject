Great for #cancer #research","Continuing research on the pancreas"],"citation":{"abstract":"Estimates of islet area and numbers and endocrine cell composition in the adult human pancreas vary from several hundred thousand to several million and beta mass ranges from 500 to 1500 mg. With this known heterogeneity, a standard processing and staining procedure was developed so that pancreatic regions were clearly defined and islets characterized using rigorous histopathology and immunolocalization examinations. Standardized procedures for processing human pancreas recovered from organ donors are described in part 1 of this series. The pancreas is processed into 3 main regions (head, body, tail) followed by transverse sections. Transverse sections from the pancreas head are further divided, as indicated based on size, and numbered alphabetically to denote subsections. This standardization allows for a complete cross sectional analysis of the head region including the uncinate region which contains islets composed primarily of pancreatic polypeptide cells to the tail region. The current report comprises part 2 of this series and describes the procedures used for serial sectioning and histopathological characterization of the pancreatic paraffin sections with an emphasis on islet endocrine cells, replication, and T-cell infiltrates. Pathology of pancreatic sections is intended to characterize both exocrine, ductular, and endocrine components. The exocrine compartment is evaluated for the presence of pancreatitis (active or chronic), atrophy, fibrosis, and fat, as well as the duct system, particularly in relationship to the presence of pancreatic intraductal neoplasia. Islets are evaluated for morphology, size, and density, endocrine cells, inflammation, fibrosis, amyloid, and the presence of replicating or apoptotic cells using H&E and IHC stains. The final component described in part 2 is the provision of the stained slides as digitized whole slide images. The digitized slides are organized by case and pancreas region in an online pathology database creating a virtual biobank. Access to this online collection is currently provided to over 200 clinicians and scientists involved in type 1 diabetes research. The online database provides a means for rapid and complete data sharing and for investigators to select blocks for paraffin or frozen serial sections.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f23","doi":"10.3791\/4068","first_seen_on":"2012-05-23T19:39:43+00:00","issns":["1940-087X"],"journal":"Journal of Visualized Experiments","last_mentioned_on":1337873448,"links":["http:\/\/www.jove.com\/video\/4068\/staining-protocols-for-human-pancreatic-islets"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jove.com\/pdf\/default.aspx?PDF=&ID=4068","pmid":"22665223","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"JoVE","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques","biology"],"title":"Staining Protocols for Human Pancreatic Islets","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/staining-protocols-human-pancreatic-islets"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5421329,"mean":6.3116136326739,"rank":3815105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":910944,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5421329,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79904,"mean":5.0995392162998,"rank":51592,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":14690,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79904,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3495,"mean":3.0568792215226,"rank":2336,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":719,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3495,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":9.3083333333333,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
