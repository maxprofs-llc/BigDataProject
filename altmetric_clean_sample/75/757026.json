Previous studies have found direct involvement of miRNAs in cancer initiation and progression. Artificial miRNAs, designed to target single or multiple genes of interest, provide a new therapeutic strategy for cancer. This study investigates the anti-tumor effect of a novel artificial miRNA, miR P-27-5p, on breast cancer. In this study, we reveal that miR P-27-5p downregulates the differential gene expressions associated with the protein modification process and regulation of cell cycle in T-47D cells. Introduction of this novel artificial miRNA, miR P-27-5p, into breast cell lines inhibits cell proliferation and induces the first \"gap\" phase (G1) cell cycle arrest in cancer cell lines but does not affect normal breast cells. We further show that miR P-27-5p targets the 3'-untranslated mRNA region (3'-UTR) of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and reduces both the mRNA and protein level of CDK4, which in turn, interferes with phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (RB1). Overall, our data suggest that the effects of miR p-27-5p on cell proliferation and G1 cell cycle arrest are through the downregulation of CDK4 and the suppression of RB1 phosphorylation. This study opens avenues for future therapies targeting breast cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e6e","authors":["Chien-Wei Tseng"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijms13056352","first_seen_on":"2012-05-23T07:43:14+00:00","issns":["1422-0067"],"issue":"5","journal":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1341462893,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/13\/5\/6352","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22754369?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/13\/5\/6352\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC3382822","pmid":"22754369","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Molecular Diversity Preservation International","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Revealing the anti-tumor effect of artificial miRNA p-27-5p on human breast carcinoma cell line T-47D.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/revealing-antitumor-effect-artificial-mirna-p275p-human-breast-carcinoma-cell-line-t47d"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505482,"mean":5.1017741758441,"rank":3033130,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1354475,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505482,"percentile":30},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75255,"mean":4.6550746006857,"rank":46327,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":26679,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75255,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1971,"mean":1.3383126903553,"rank":758,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":1122,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1971,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.55833333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":6}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1},"mendeley":{"TW":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NicholasMMurphy\/statuses\/220737492297596928","license":"public","citation_ids":[757026],"posted_on":"2012-07-05T04:34:53+00:00","author":{"name":"Nick Murphy","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/978677061\/345_n_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"NicholasMMurphy","tweeter_id":"74478819","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":814},"tweet_id":"220737492297596928"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/rnomics\/statuses\/205202164702912512","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[757026],"posted_on":"2012-05-23T07:43:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Fabrice Leclerc","url":"http:\/\/about.me\/leclercfabrice","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/461944449832984577\/OFZs5M7c_normal.png","description":"#RNomics, #RNA biology, RNA #bioinformatics, #RNA_World & #evolution, technologies & resources, daily papers: http:\/\/bit.ly\/HaycPM & http:\/\/bit.ly\/18cyMMK","id_on_source":"rnomics","tweeter_id":"177684507","geo":{"lt":46,"ln":2,"country":"FR"},"followers":1974},"tweet_id":"205202164702912512"}]}}
