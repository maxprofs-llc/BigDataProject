In social drinkers, these two processes have been usually studied separately by recording event-related potentials (ERPs) during rapid picture presentation. The aim of our study was to confront social drinkers to a task triggering high alcohol cue-reactivity, to verify whether it specifically altered inhibitory performance, by using long-lasting background picture presentation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012PLoSO...7E7466P","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["G\u00e9raldine Petit","Charles Kornreich","Xavier No\u00ebl","Paul Verbanck","Salvatore Campanella"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0037466","first_seen_on":"2012-05-18T17:31:05+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"5","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1337362152,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0037466?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+plosone%2FPLoSONE+%28PLoS+ONE+Alerts%3A+New+Articles%29"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0037466.pdf","pmid":"22616012","pubdate":"2012-05-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e37466","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Alcohol-Related Context Modulates Performance of Social Drinkers in a Visual Go\/No-Go Task: A Preliminary Assessment of Event-Related Potentials","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alcoholrelated-context-modulates-performance-social-drinkers-visual-gonogo-task-preliminary-assessme"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506977,"mean":5.1265981649798,"rank":3083063,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":966182,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506977,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75845,"mean":4.6515111017351,"rank":47737,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":16973,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75845,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80036,"mean":8.2965760979572,"rank":55739,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":16481,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80036,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3144,"mean":5.9730085905186,"rank":2262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":562,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3144,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
