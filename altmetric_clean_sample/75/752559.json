Measurement of AVP levels has limitations due to its short half-life and cumbersome detection method. Copeptin is a more stable peptide derived from the same precursor molecule. We evaluated the plasma copeptin concentration in two independent studies: first, in an experimental baboon model of hemorrhagic shock, and second, in a prospective observational study of 101 consecutive critically ill patients at a university hospital. Copeptin was measured with a newly developed sandwich immunoassay using two polyclonal antibodies to the C-terminal region (amino acid sequence 132-164) of pre-pro-AVP. Copeptin concentrations in hemorrhagic shock increased markedly from median (range) of 7.5 [2.7-13) to 269 pM (241-456 pM). After reperfusion, copeptin levels dropped within hours to a plateau of 27 pM (15-78 pM). In the critically ill patient cohort, copeptin values increased significantly with the severity of the disease and were in patients without sepsis [27.6 pM [2.3-297 pM]), in sepsis [50.0 pM [8.5-268 pM]), in severe sepsis [73.6 pM [15.3-317 pM]), and in septic shock [171.5 pM (35.1-504 pM] compared with 4.1 pM (1.0-13.8 pM) in healthy controls (P for all vs. controls <0.001). On admission, circulating copeptin levels were higher in nonsurvivors (171.5 pM, 46.5-504.0 pM) as compared with survivors (86.8 pM, 8.5-386.0 pM; P = 0.01). Copeptin levels correlated with basal cortisol levels (r = 0.42; P < 0.001) and osmolality (r = 0.42; P < 0.001). In a logistic regression model including other covariates besides copeptin (e.g., determinants of fluid status) on survival, serum copeptin levels were the only independent significant predictor of outcome (P = 0.03). Copeptin concentrations are elevated in hemorrhagic and septic shock. Copeptin was higher on admission in nonsurvivors as compared with survivors, suggesting copeptin as a prognostic marker in sepsis. The availability of a reliable assay for the measurement of AVP release can also prove useful for the assessment of fluid and osmosis status in various diseases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f610008925","doi":"10.1097\/shk.0b013e318033e5da","first_seen_on":"2012-05-20T07:33:01+00:00","issns":["1073-2322"],"issue":"2","journal":"Shock","last_mentioned_on":1337491080,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/shockjournal\/Fulltext\/2007\/08000\/Copeptin,_A_Stable_Peptide_of_the_Arginine.15.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/shockjournal\/2007\/08000\/Copeptin,_A_Stable_Peptide_of_the_Arginine.15.pdf","pmid":"17515850","pubdate":"2007-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Research Department, B R A H M S AG, Biotechnology Centre Hennigsdorf\/Berlin, Neuendorfstrasse 25, D-16761 Hennigsdorf bei Berlin, Germany. a.morgenthaler@brahms.de","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"219","subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Copeptin, A Stable Peptide of the Arginine Vasopressin Precursor, Is Elevated in Hemorrhagic and Septic Shock","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/copeptin-stable-peptide-arginine-vasopressin-precursor-elevated-hemorrhagic-septic-shock"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":4205080,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77717,"mean":4.9512240207937,"rank":63720,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77717,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1459,"mean":1.2392373113855,"rank":1266,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1459,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":0.75625,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":12,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Ph.
