Several markers were evaluated for their prognostic value with promising early results, however none of them was proven to be clinically useful in large-scale studies, leading to outstanding efforts to identify new markers. Given the heterogeneity of human glioblastomas further investigations are necessary to identify both cancer stem cell-specific markers and the molecular mechanisms sustaining the tumorigenic potential of these cells to develop tailored treatments. Markers for glioblastoma stem cells such as CD133, CD15, integrin-\u03b16, L1CAM might be informative to identify these cells but cannot be conclusively linked to a stem cell phenotype. Overlap of expression, functional state and morphology of different subpopulations lead to carefully consider the techniques employed so far to isolate these cells. Due to a dearth of methods and markers reliably identifying the candidate cancer stem cells, the isolation\/enrichment of cancer stem cells to be therapeutically targeted remains a major challenge.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f610004085","authors":["Pelicci, Giuliana"],"doi":"10.1155\/2012\/376894","first_seen_on":"2012-05-23T14:06:08+00:00","issns":["1687-8450"],"journal":"Journal of Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1337809384,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/jo\/2012\/376894\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.hindawi.comjournals\/jo\/2012\/376894.pdf","pmid":"22685459","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Current Strategies for Identification of Glioma Stem Cells: Adequate or Unsatisfactory?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/current-strategies-identification-glioma-stem-cells-adequate-unsatisfactory"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506762,"mean":5.1233691071599,"rank":2125214,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2212166,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506762,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75262,"mean":4.7036892680139,"rank":29868,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":41949,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75262,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":135,"mean":1.9197910447761,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":83,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":135,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":4.892,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":19,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Student  > Ph.
