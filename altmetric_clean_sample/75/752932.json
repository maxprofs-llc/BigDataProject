However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their transcriptional dysregulation are still unclear. The transcription factor cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein (CREB) and the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) have been implicated in rodent models of depression. We previously provided evidence that Bdnf expression critically rely on a potent CREB coactivator called CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 1 (CRTC1).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023d9","authors":["Breuillaud L","Rossetti C","Meylan EM","M\u00e9rinat C","Halfon O","Magistretti PJ","Cardinaux JR"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.biopsych.2012.04.011","first_seen_on":"2012-05-20T15:30:13+00:00","issns":["0006-3223"],"issue":"","journal":"Biological Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1347395796,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22592058","http:\/\/www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com\/article\/S0006-3223(12)00362-9\/abstract?utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed&rss=yes"],"pmid":"22592058","pubdate":"2012-05-18T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["psychophysiology","psychiatry"],"title":"Deletion of CREB-Regulated Transcription Coactivator 1 Induces Pathological Aggression, Depression-Related Behaviors, and Neuroplasticity Genes Dysregulation in Mice","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/deletion-crebregulated-transcription-coactivator-1-induces-pathological-aggression-depressionrelated"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":1976083,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3029416,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77728,"mean":4.949923810259,"rank":22876,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":54304,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77728,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2145,"mean":10.247344216418,"rank":1244,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":894,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2145,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":12.24525,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
