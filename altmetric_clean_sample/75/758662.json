The situation is especially important for school children or the teenagers as it may cause peer criticism and psychological issues. Various techniques have been suggested, and it is possible to obtain a successful result with one of these techniques chosen according to the patient's specific needs and the surgeon's preference. However, there are not many publications regarding the finer details of this operation such as the correction of the prominent lobule. There are few techniques available with limited success. In this study, we humbly present our Y-to-V setback technique for correction of the prominent lobule, as an individual operation or as an adjunct to a successful otoplasty. A total of 22 cases in which prominent lobule correction had to be performed during otoplasty were included in our study. Mean age of the patients was 21.3 years. Of the 22 patients, 14 were female and 8 were male. All cases underwent bilateral lobule transposition together with bilateral otoplasty. All cases have been followed up for at least 12 months. Mean follow-up was 20 months. The lobule incisions were inconspicuous, and they were well hidden in the postauricular sulcus. Hypertrophic scars or keloid were not seen in any cases. No relapse of lobule prominence was seen during the follow-up period. All patients were satisfied with their results. One of the reasons the ears may look unnatural or \"operated\" after an otoplasty is the disharmony of the lobule with the corrected parts. Even normal lobules may become relatively prominent after medialization of the helix. It is suggested that the use of a \"v\"-shaped advancement flap elevated from the posterior surface of the lobule may be a very useful technique to set the lobule back to the desired extent.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a2c","doi":"10.1097\/sap.0b013e3181ea1e7a","first_seen_on":"2012-05-23T23:35:18+00:00","issns":["0148-7043"],"issue":"6","journal":"Annals of Plastic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1337815899,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/annalsplasticsurgery\/Abstract\/2011\/06000\/Y_to_V_Setback_for_Prominent_Lobule_Correction_in.12.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/annalsplasticsurgery\/2011\/06000\/Y_to_V_Setback_for_Prominent_Lobule_Correction_in.12.pdf","pmid":"21346538","pubdate":"2011-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"623","subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Y-to-V Setback for Prominent Lobule Correction in Otoplasty","type":"article","volume":"66","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ytov-setback-prominent-lobule-correction-otoplasty"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":4207719,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77603,"mean":5.0029810056442,"rank":63923,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77603,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1961,"mean":1.0778551020408,"rank":1603,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1961,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104,"mean":0.60242718446602,"rank":89,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
