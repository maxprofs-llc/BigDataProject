In particular, ProteinPilot results from MaxQuant-processed peaklists for Orbitrap data sets resulted in improved spectral utilization due to an improved peaklist quality with higher precision and high precursor mass accuracy (HPMA). The output and postsearch analysis tools of both workflows were utilized for previously unexplored features of a three-dimensional fractionated and hexapeptide library (ProteoMiner) treated whole saliva data set comprising 200 fractions. ProteinPilot's ability to simultaneously predict multiple modifications showed an advantage from ProteoMiner treatment for modified peptide identification. We demonstrate that complementary approaches in the analysis pipeline provide comprehensive results for the whole saliva data set acquired on an LTQ Orbitrap. Overall our results establish a workflow for improved protein identification from high mass accuracy data.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f610008649","authors":["Jagtap, Pratik","Bandhakavi, Sricharan","Higgins, LeeAnn","McGowan, Thomas","Sa, Rongxiao","Stone, Matthew D.","Chilton, John","Arriaga, Edgar A.","Seymour, Sean L.","Griffin, Timothy J."],"doi":"10.1002\/pmic.201100097","endpage":"1730","first_seen_on":"2012-05-23T15:52:38+00:00","issns":["1615-9861","1615-9853"],"issue":"11","journal":"PROTEOMICS","last_mentioned_on":1337788349,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/pmic.201100097\/abstract;jsessionid=463F8011A3DC44D5EC8F79F52990C3C2.d02t04"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/pmic.201100097\/pdf","pmid":"22623410","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1726","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Workflow for analysis of high mass accuracy salivary dataset using MaxQuant and ProteinPilot search algorithm","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/workflow-analysis-high-mass-accuracy-salivary-data-set-using-maxquant-proteinpilot-search-algorithm"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6278272,"mean":5.9867156995941,"rank":5338524,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6278272,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81548,"mean":5.2033163206494,"rank":66617,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81548,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1262,"mean":2.6395210150674,"rank":1025,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1262,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":1.475,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
