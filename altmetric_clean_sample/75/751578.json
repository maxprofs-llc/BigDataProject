Their degree may be moderate (50-69%) or severe (70-99%). Current diagnostic methods include ultrasound, MR- or CT-angiography. Stenosis severity, irregular plaque surface, and presence of microembolic signals detected by transcranial Doppler predict the early recurrence risk, which may be as high as 20%. Initial therapy comprises antiplatelets and statins. Benefit of revascularization is greater in men, in older patients, and in severe stenosis; patients with moderate stenoses may also profit particularly if the plaque has an irregular aspect. An intervention should be performed within <2\u00a0weeks. In large randomized studies comparing endarterectomy and stenting, endovascular therapy was associated with a higher risk of periprocedural stroke, yet in some studies, with a lower risk of myocardial infarction and of cranial neuropathy. These trials support endarterectomy as the first choice treatment. Risk factors for each of the two therapies have been indentified: coronary artery disease, neck radiation, contralateral laryngeal nerve palsy for endarterectomy, and, elderly patients (>70\u00a0years), arch vessel tortuosity and plaques with low echogenicity on ultrasound for carotid stenting. Lastly, in direct comparisons, a contralateral occlusion increases the risk of periprocedural complications in both types of treatment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002158","authors":["Momjian\u2010Mayor, I.","Burkhard, P.","Murith, N.","Mugnai, D.","Yilmaz, H.","Narata, A.\u2010P.","Lovblad, K.","Pereira, V.","Righini, M.","Bounameaux, H.","Sztajzel, R.
