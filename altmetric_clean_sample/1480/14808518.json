This study sought to assess whether caffeine intake was associated with changes in pupil size and\/or amplitude of accommodation.Patients and methodsA double-masked, crossover study was conducted in 50 healthy subjects of age range 19 to 25 years. Subjects were randomized to treatments such that subjects consumed either 250\u2009mg caffeine drink or vehicle on separate days. Amplitude of accommodation was measured by the push-up technique, and pupil size using a millimeter ruler fixed to a slit lamp biomicroscope in dim illumination (5\u2009lux). Amplitude of accommodation and pupil size were taken at baseline, and at 30, 60 and 90\u2009min time points post treatment. Repeated measures one-way ANOVA and paired t-test were used in analyzing data.ResultsAmplitude of accommodation and pupil size after caffeine intake were significantly greater than vehicle (P<0.001) at each time point. Consumption of the caffeine beverage was associated with significant increases in amplitude of accommodation and pupil size with time (P<0.001). Amplitude of accommodation rose from 12.4 (\u00b12.2\u2009D) at baseline to 15.8(\u00b12.6\u2009D) at 90\u2009min. Similarly, pupil size increased from 3.4 (\u00b10.4\u2009mm) at baseline to 4.5 (\u00b10.72\u2009mm) at 90\u2009min. Consumption of vehicle was not associated with increase in amplitude of accommodation or pupil size with time.ConclusionPupil size and accommodation are affected after ingestion of caffeine. This study suggests caffeine may have some influence on visual functions.Eye advance online publication, 16 December 2016;
