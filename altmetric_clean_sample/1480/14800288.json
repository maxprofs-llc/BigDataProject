The electronic structure and vibrational spectra of the hundreds of resulting isomers were used to analyze the source of the observed bonding patterns. A structural evolution from dominantly two-coordinate structures (n = 1-4) toward a mixture of two- and three-coordinate structures was observed at n = 5-6, where the stability provided by expanded hydrogen-bonding was competitive with the dominantly electrostatic interaction between the water ligand and remaining binding sites of the metal ion. Further hydration (n = 7-10) led to a mixture of three- and four-coordinate structures. The metal ion was found, through spectroscopic signatures, to appreciably perturb the O-H bonds of even third-shell water molecules, which highlighted the ability of this nominally simple ion to partially activate the surrounding water network.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec4","authors":["Jonathan D.
