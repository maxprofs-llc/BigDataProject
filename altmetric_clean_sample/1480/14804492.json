The objective of the present study was to define the prevalence of regret among patients who had undergone a major abdominal or thoracic operative procedure and to identify factors associated with postoperative regret.\nDecisional regret was assessed using the validated Decision Regret Scale, which consisted of 5 items with Likert-scale responses. Data on preoperative decision-making preferences and postoperative regret, quality of life, and symptoms of anxiety and depression were collected and analyzed.\nOverall, 157 (68.9%) patients agreed to participate and completed the survey, while 12 (5.3%) patients declined citing lack of time or interest. The types of operative procedures varied, with 65 (41.7%) patients undergoing a thoracic operation, 59 (37.8%) resection of the pancreas, liver or bile duct, and 32 (20.5%) patients having a colorectal\/enteric operation. Although most patients (n\u00a0=\u00a098, 62.4%) expressed no degree of regret, a subset of patients did; specifically, 59 (37.6%) patients conveyed a varied degree of postoperative regret, with 20 (12.7%) patients expressing a moderate degree of regret, and 13 patients (8.3%) experiencing substantial regret. Postoperative regret was associated with a history of postoperative complications (odds ratio 4.7, 95% confidence interval 1.2-17.7, P\u00a0<\u00a0.01) and with discordance between a patient's preferred and actual perceived decision-making role (odds ratio 5.3, 95% confidence interval 1.6-17.4, P\u00a0<\u00a0.01). Patients experiencing regret were 5 times more likely than patients not experiencing regret to demonstrate borderline or abnormal depression scores (odds ratio 5.4, 95% confidence interval 1.6-18.0, P\u00a0<\u00a0.01); anxiety scores directly correlated with regret (rho 0.254, P\u00a0<\u00a0.01).\nPatient-reported decisional regret after major abdominal and thoracic operations was present in 37% of patients, with roughly 1 in 12 patients reporting substantial regret and distress over the decision to have undergone operation. Discordance between patients' preferred and actual involvement in operative decision-making was associated with postoperative regret, as was poor quality of life, anxiety, and depression.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008a97","authors":["Wilson, Ana","Winner, Megan","Yahanda, Alexander","Andreatos, Nikolaos","Ronnekleiv-Kelly, Sean","Pawlik, Timothy M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.surg.2016.10.028","first_seen_on":"2016-12-16T23:29:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00396060","1532-7361"],"journal":"Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1482039074,"links":["http:\/\/www.surgjournal.com\/article\/S0039-6060(16)30723-1\/fulltext?rss=yes"],"pmid":"27993362","pubdate":"2017-01-07T00:24:43+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Factors associated with decisional regret among patients undergoing major thoracic and abdominal operations","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/factors-associated-decisional-regret-among-patients-undergoing-major-thoracic-abdominal-operations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":1.1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7907411,"mean":6.6922707093667,"rank":4119468,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3760697,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7907411,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252619,"mean":12.392302646684,"rank":138512,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":112555,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252619,"percentile":44},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2261,"mean":3.1510628318584,"rank":1043,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":1205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2261,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156,"mean":3.2534709677419,"rank":66,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":85,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
