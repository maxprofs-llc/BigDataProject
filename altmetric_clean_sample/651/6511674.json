They also develop of an understanding what mental illness and associated phenomena mean. When nurses themselves develop mental illness, they must learn to establish a new identity as a patient and more specifically as a nurse-patient, and come to a new understanding of what mental illness means to them. This autoethnographic paper focuses on the author's own experience of finding an identity as nurse-patient and discovering what that really meant, at the same time incorporating analysis to connect the personal and the cultural.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005738","authors":["Ashley L.
