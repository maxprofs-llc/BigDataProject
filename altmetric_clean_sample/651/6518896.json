We extracted coefficients for continuous BW and odds ratio (OR) for PTB from each individual study, and meta-analysis was used to combine the coefficient and OR of individual studies. The methodological quality of individual study was assessed using a standard protocol proposed by Downs and Black. Forty-four studies met the inclusion criteria.\nIn random effects meta-analyses, BW as a continuous outcome was negativelyassociated with 10 \u03bcg\/m(3) increase in PM10 (-10.31 g; 95% confidence interval [CI], -13.57 to -3.13 g; I-squared=0%, p=0.947) and PM2.5 (-22.17 g; 95% CI, -37.93 to -6.41 g; I-squared=92.3%, p <0.001) exposure during entire pregnancy, adjusted for maternal smoking. A significantly increased risk of PTB per 10 \u03bcg\/m(3) increase in PM10 (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.41; I-squared=0%, p =0.977) and PM2.5 (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.22; I-squared=92.5%, p <0.001) exposure during entire pregnancy was observed. Effect size of change in BW per 10 \u03bcg\/m(3) increase in PM tended to report stronger associations after adjustment for maternal smoking.\nWhile this systematic review supports an adverse impact of maternal exposure to particulate air pollution on birth outcomes, variation in effects by exposure period and sources of heterogeneity between studies should be further explored.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc02","authors":["Dirga Kumar Lamichhane","Jong-Han Leem","Ji-Young Lee","Hwan-Cheol Kim"],"doi":"10.5620\/eht.e2015011","first_seen_on":"2016-04-07T10:27:42+00:00","issns":["2233-6567"],"journal":"Environmental Health and Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1459954288,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4722965\/"],"pmcid":"PMC4722965","pmid":"26796890","pubdate":"2016-04-07T20:15:00+00:00","publisher":"The Korean Society of Environmental Health and Toxicology","startpage":"e2015011","title":"A meta-analysis of exposure to particulate matter and adverse birth outcomes","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metaanalysis-exposure-particulate-matter-adverse-birth-outcomes-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7506617,"mean":6.4985319251666,"rank":1024349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6415943,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7506617,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270696,"mean":11.236620137054,"rank":54895,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":212193,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270696,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":2.4,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
