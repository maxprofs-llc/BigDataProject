We hypothesized that visual tracking ability in very preterm infants predicts later neurodevelopment.\nIn 67 very preterm infants (gestational age<32\u2009wk), eye and head movements were assessed at 4 mo corrected age while the infant tracked a moving object. Gaze gain, smooth pursuit, head movements, and timing of gaze relative the object were analyzed off line. Results of the five subscales included in the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-III) at 3 y of age were evaluated in relation to the visual tracking data and to perinatal risk factors.\nSignificant correlations were obtained between gaze gain and cognition, receptive and expressive language, and fine motor function, respectively, also after controlling for gestational age, severe brain damage, retinopathy of prematurity, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.\nThis is the first study demonstrating that the basic ability to visually track a moving object at 4 mo robustly predicts neurodevelopment at 3 y of age in children born very preterm.Pediatric Research (2016); doi:10.1038\/pr.2016.37.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f61000848b","authors":["Ylva Fredriksson Kaul","Kerstin Rosander","Claes von Hofsten","Katarina Strand Brodd","Gerd Holmstr\u00f6m","Alexander Kaul","Birgitta B\u00f6hm","Lena Hellstr\u00f6m-Westas"],"doi":"10.1038\/pr.2016.37","first_seen_on":"2016-04-07T05:16:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1530-0447","0031-3998"],"journal":"Pediatric Research","last_mentioned_on":1460976966,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/pr\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/pr201637a.html"],"pmid":"27027722","pubdate":"2016-03-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Preclinical research","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Paediatric research","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Outcomes research","scheme":"npg"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Visual tracking in very preterm infants at 4 mo predicts neurodevelopment at 3 y of age","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/visual-tracking-very-preterm-infants-4-mo-predicts-neurodevelopment-3-y-age"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7565447,"mean":6.5306080289211,"rank":3690698,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3682923,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7565447,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271463,"mean":11.245506015575,"rank":136149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":124935,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271463,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1412,"mean":4.5132799433026,"rank":779,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":596,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1412,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":2.5021052631579,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
