These patients were evaluated by annual neuropsychological testing, brain MRI, and follow-up PiB-PET.\nOver 3 years, 31 of 52 patients (59.6%) had incident cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) in the lobar and deep regions. Both baseline and longitudinal changes in lacune numbers were associated with increased numbers of lobar and deep microbleeds, while baseline and longitudinal changes in PiB uptake ratio were associated only with the progression of lobar microbleeds, especially in the temporal, parietal, and occipital areas. Regional white matter hyperintensity severity was also associated with regional lobar CMBs in the parietal and occipital regions. There were interactive effects between baseline and longitudinal lacune number and PiB retention on lobar microbleed progression. Increased lobar, but not deep, CMBs were associated with decreased scores in the digit span backward task and Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test.\nOur findings suggest that amyloid-related pathology and hCSVD have synergistic effects on the progression of lobar microbleeds, providing new clinical insight into the interaction between amyloid burden and hCSVD on CMB progression and cognitive decline with implications for developing effective prevention strategies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b59","authors":["Kim, Yeo Jin","Kim, Hee Jin","Park, Jae-Hyun","Kim, Seonwoo","Woo, Sook-Young","Kwak, Ki-Chang","Lee, Jong Min","Jung, Na-Yeon","Kim, Jae Seung","Choe, Yearn Seong","Lee, Kyung-Han","Moon, Seung Hwan","Lee, Jae-Hong","Kim, Yun Joong","Werring, David J","Na, Duk L","Seo, Sang Won","Yeo Jin Kim","Hee Jin Kim","Jae-Hyun Park","Seonwoo Kim","Sook-Young Woo","Ki-Chang Kwak","Jong Min Lee","Na-Yeon Jung","Jae Seung Kim","Yearn Seong Choe","Kyung-Han Lee","Seung Hwan Moon","Jae-Hong Lee","Yun Joong Kim","David J.
