Extended clinical neuropsychological evaluation documented all the characteristic features of the syndrome described by Kl\u00fcver and Bucy following bilateral ablation of the temporal lobes in adult Rhesus monkeys, including \"psychic blindness,\" oral exploration, hypermetamorphic impulse to action,\" lack of emotional responsiveness, aberrant sexual behavior, and an insatiable appetite. Additionally, a severe Wernicke's aphasia and a profound memory disorder were evident. The significance of these features as regards limbic function in the human is discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000584c","authors":["Marlowe, W B","Mancall, E L","Thomas, J J"],"first_seen_on":"2016-09-16T10:36:17+00:00","issns":["0010-9452"],"issue":"1","journal":"Cortex: A Journal Devoted to the Study of the Nervous System & Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1474022172,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/168031"],"pmid":"168031","pubdate":"1975-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["brain","behavioralsciences","neurology"],"title":"Complete Kl\u00fcver-Bucy syndrome in man.","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/complete-kluverbucy-syndrome-man"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8389481,"mean":7.0670107241375,"rank":2152561,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5090796,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8389481,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233814,"mean":12.849193902819,"rank":79590,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":150394,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233814,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1413,"mean":9.2323456090652,"rank":589,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":670,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1413,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":6.0667213114754,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Kl\u00fcver\u2013Bucy syndrome","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=739691803#altmetric_citation_0f9d4fd8-4df3-412e-abfd-b5fc43e88d36","license":"public","citation_ids":[12030155],"posted_on":"2016-09-16T10:36:12+00:00","summary":"Kl\u00fcver\u2013Bucy syndrome is a syndrome resulting from bilateral lesions of the medial temporal lobe (including amygdaloid nucleus).","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=4259210","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Chris Capoccia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Chris Capoccia"}}]}}
