All of the patients received 1 g, IV acetaminophen, every 6 h during the 1(st) and 3(rd) days of admission and placebo during the 2(nd) and 4(th) days. Total dose of morphine sulfate needed, its complications, and the BPS scores at the end of every 6 h interval were compared.\nTotally forty patients were enrolled. The mean pain scores were significantly lower in the 2(nd) and 4(th) days (4.33 and 3.66, respectively; mean: 4.0) in which the patients had received just morphine sulfate compared to the 1(st) and 3(rd) days (7.36 and 3.93, respectively; mean: 5.65) in which the patients had received acetaminophen in addition to morphine sulfate too (P < 0.001). Cumulative dose of morphine sulfate used, was significantly higher in the 1(st) and 3(rd) days (8.92 and 3.15 mg, respectively; 12.07 mg in total) compared to the 2(nd) and 4(th) days (6.47 mg and 3.22 mg, respectively; 9.7 mg in total) (P = 0.035).\nIn our study, IV acetaminophen had no effect on decreasing the BPSs and need of morphine sulfate in intubated patients admitted to ICU.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002aa9","authors":["Mahshidfar, Babak","Sameti, Azadeh","Abbasi, Saeed","Farsi, Davood","Mofidi, Mani","Hafezimoghadam, Peyman","Rahimzadeh, Popak","Rezai, Mahdi"],"doi":"10.4103\/0972-5229.188197","first_seen_on":"2016-09-16T12:19:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0972-5229"],"issue":"8","journal":"Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1483133987,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27630458\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27630458"],"pmid":"27630458","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"465","title":"Can intravenous acetaminophen reduce the needs to more opioids to control pain in intubated patients?","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intravenous-acetaminophen-reduce-needs-more-opioids-control-pain-intubated-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":2.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8005094,"mean":6.7552691735077,"rank":3093884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4876952,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8005094,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230141,"mean":12.664105744329,"rank":81988,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":146611,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230141,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262,"mean":2.8392567049808,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":197,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.5,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":6}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Acetaminophen Research Updates","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1020120424775685&id=337316776389390","license":"public","citation_ids":[18482147,11720274,10521848,10220456,9139959,4903830,1861784,2142342,2713577,2000733,11935365,2002967,3104079,4362765,702814,2215730,216751,8710726,1904597,1633412,4106009,8526612,4239903,8794388,4215451,12031770,434867,1459805,3049521,469894,411354,2558742,21580470,11933583,7262250,9712892],"posted_on":"2016-07-12T17:42:03+00:00","summary":"#HearThisWell #CDCwhistleblower #cdcFRAUD #Vaxxed","author":{"name":"Oregonians for Vaccine Truth and Healthcare Choice","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/337316776389390","facebook_wall_name":"Oregonians for Vaccine Truth and Healthcare Choice","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/337316776389390\/picture","id_on_source":"337316776389390"}},{"title":"Paracetamol use during pregnancy and attention and executive function in offspring at age 5 years. - PubMed - NCBI","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1868703870074733&id=1774188896192898","license":"public","citation_ids":[18482147,11720274,10521848,10220456,9139959,4903830,1861784,2142342,2713577,11935365,2002967,3104079,4362765,702814,2215730,216751,8710726,1904597,1633412,12548386,4106009,8526612,4239903,8794388,4215451,12031770,434867,1459805,3049521,469894,411354,2558742,21580470,11933583,7262250,9712892,2000733,18482147],"posted_on":"2016-12-30T21:39:47+00:00","summary":"Overview of research of association between Acetaminophen (Tylenol, paracetamol, Calpol) and neurodevelopment to include autism (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder(ADHD):\n\n9 out of 9 human, prospective, cohort studies suggest that pregnancy","author":{"name":"Acetaminophen Research Updates","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/1774188896192898","facebook_wall_name":"Acetaminophen Research Updates","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/1774188896192898\/picture","id_on_source":"1774188896192898"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NoDesat\/statuses\/776783871421526016","license":"gnip","rt":["painfreeED"],"citation_ids":[12031770],"posted_on":"2016-09-16T14:04:41+00:00","author":{"name":"Klint W.
