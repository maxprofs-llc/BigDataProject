It is usually characterized by insidious onset and late diagnosis because of the absence of symptoms, allowing ovarian cancer cases to progress rapidly and become unresectable. The tumor suppressor, p53, plays an important role in regulating cell cycles and apoptosis. p53 is regulated by several molecules, and it interacts with other apoptotic proteins.\nTo compare the prognosis of ovarian serous carcinoma and evaluate the expression of DNA-PKcs, Akt3, GSK-3\u03b2, and p53 in cancerous cells.\nDNA-PKcs, Akt3, GSK-3\u03b2, and p53 expression levels were scored using immunohistochemistry staining of tissue samples from 132 women with ovarian serous adenocarcinoma. Expression was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. Analyses were stratified by age, tumor grades, cancer stages and serum CA 125 levels.\nSignificant differences in DNA-PKcs, Akt3, and p53 expression were observed between participants with different stages and tumor grades of ovarian serous adenocarcinoma. DNA-PKcs and p53 expression increased along with increasing tumor grade. Meanwhile, DNA-PKcs, Akt3, and p53 expression increased along with increasing cancer stage, and with a decrease in 5-year overall survival rate.\nThis study shows that elevated expression of DNA-PKcs, Akt3, and p53 in ovarian serous adenocarcinoma tissues are an indication of more advanced disease and worse prognosis.","authors":["Shin, Kyusik","Kim, Ki Hyung","Yoon, Man Soo","Suh, Dong Soo","Lee, Ji Young","Kim, Ari","Eo, Wankyu"],"first_seen_on":"2016-09-16T11:01:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1899-5276"],"issue":"3","journal":"Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University","last_mentioned_on":1474023636,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27629740?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27629740","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Expression of Interactive Genes Associated with Apoptosis and Their Prognostic Value for Ovarian Serous Adenocarcinoma.","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expression-interactive-genes-associated-apoptosis-prognostic-value-ovarian-serous-adenocarcinoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ovPCD_papers\/statuses\/776737546705391616","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12030493],"posted_on":"2016-09-16T11:00:36+00:00","author":{"name":"ovaryPCDpapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/622551872801378304\/GQKixh8k_normal.jpg","description":"Feed of scientific papers on ovary\/oogenesis\/oocyte programmed cell death (PCD).
