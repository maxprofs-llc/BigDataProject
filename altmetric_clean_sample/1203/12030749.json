Its main active component is hederagenin, a naturally occurring triterpene, and in this study, we examined the anti-inflammatory effects of hederagenin in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blot, and RT-PCR. In addition, its effects on acute inflammation in vivo were observed using a carrageenan-induced mouse hind paw edema assay. Furthermore, the changes on the histopathology and histomorphometry of hind paw skins were examined using carrageenan-treated mice. Treatment with hederagenin (10, 30 and 100\u03bcM) resulted in inhibited levels of protein expression of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated iNOS, COX-2, and NF-\u03baB as well as production of NO, PGE2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 induced by lipopolysaccharide. Consistent with these results, hederagenin also dose-dependently reduced the lipopolysaccharide-induced mRNA levels of iNOS and COX-2, and of the above-mentioned cytokines. Interestingly, results of the carrageenan-induced mouse hind paw edema assay showed an anti-edema effect of hederagenin. Furthermore, hederagenin (30mg\/kg) inhibited the carrageenan-induced increases in skin thicknesses, infiltrated inflammatory cells, and mast cell degranulation. These results suggest that hederagenin may possess anti-inflammatory activities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b0e","authors":["Lee, Chul Won","Park, Sang Mi","Zhao, Rongjie","Lee, Chu","Chun, Wonjoo","Son, Yonghae","Kim, Sung Hun","Jung, Ji Yun","Jegal, Kyung Hwan","Cho, Il Je","Ku, Sae Kwang","Kim, Young Woo","Ju, Seong A","Kim, Sang Chan","An, Won G"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.intimp.2015.10.002","endpage":"537","first_seen_on":"2016-09-16T11:24:35+00:00","issns":["1878-1705","15675769"],"issue":"2","journal":"International Immunopharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1474025062,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26481049?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26481049","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"528","subjects":["pharmacology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Hederagenin, a major component of Clematis mandshurica Ruprecht root, attenuates inflammatory responses in RAW 264.7 cells and in mice","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hederagenin-major-component-clematis-mandshurica-ruprecht-root-attenuates-inflammatory-responses-raw"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8389481,"mean":7.0670107241375,"rank":7251828,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8389481,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233814,"mean":12.849147925906,"rank":194664,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233814,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1098,"mean":1.9290938924339,"rank":697,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1098,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":1.5704642857143,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RootPapers\/statuses\/776743525580873728","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12030749],"posted_on":"2016-09-16T11:24:22+00:00","author":{"name":"Root Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/447736797422813184\/Q7OqMgVA_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Plant Root papers in #PubMed, #arXiv, #Bioarxiv and #PeerJ Preprints.
