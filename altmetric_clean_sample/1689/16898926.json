However, their effects on the genetic structure of widespread and abundant soil animal species such as the Collembola Parisotoma notabilis remain virtually unknown. This generalist and parthenogenetic species is an early colonizer of disturbed habitats and often occurs in human modified environments. To investigate ancient climatic influence and recent distributions on the genetic structure of P. notabilis we analyzed populations on a pan-European scale using three genetic markers differing in substitution rates. The results showed that P. notabilis comprises several genetic lineages with distinct distribution ranges that diverged in the Miocene. Genetic distances of COI between lineages ranged between 15% and 18% and molecular clock estimates suggest Late Miocene divergences considering the standard arthropod rate of 2.3% per my. Compared to other soil-living arthropods like oribatid mites, European lineages of P. notabilis are rather young and genetically uniform. The close association with anthropogenic habitats presumably contributed to rapid spread in Europe.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Helge von Saltzwedel","Stefan Scheu","Ina Schaefer","Xiao-Yue Hong"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0170909","first_seen_on":"2017-03-01T16:51:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"2","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1503742501,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0170909","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28170395?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0170909&type=printable","pmid":"28170395","pubdate":"2017-02-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0170909","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Genetic structure and distribution of Parisotoma notabilis (Collembola) in Europe: Cryptic diversity, split of lineages and colonization patterns","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0170909","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genetic-structure-distribution-parisotoma-notabilis-collembola-europe-cryptic-diversity-split-lineag"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8430317,"mean":7.0913096536278,"rank":6396642,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1145940,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8430317,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244967,"mean":13.740884620722,"rank":178649,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":39880,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244967,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116193,"mean":10.656224955247,"rank":84874,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":18287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116193,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4421,"mean":11.432897737557,"rank":3157,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":741,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4421,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
