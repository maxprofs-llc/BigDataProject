Geriatrics and palliative care are medical specialties pertinent to elderly, yet neither completely addresses the needs of older adults with chronic illness. Interprofessional faculty developed Geriatric Education Using a Palliative Care Framework (GEPaC) to teach an integrated approach to care. Interactive online modules use a variety of instructional methods, including case-based interactive questions, audio-visual presentations, reflective questions, and scenario-based tests. Modules are designed for online education and\/or traditional classroom and have been approved for Continuing Medical Education. Pre- and post-test scores showed significant improvements in knowledge, attitudes and skills. Participants were highly satisfied with the coursework's relevance and usefulness for their practice, and GEPaC prepares them to address needs of older adults for disease and symptom management, communicating goals of care and supportive\/compassionate care.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f6100014df","authors":["Beverly Lunsford","Laurie Posey"],"doi":"10.1080\/02701960.2017.1285293","first_seen_on":"2017-03-01T16:02:12+00:00","issns":["0270-1960","1545-3847"],"journal":"Gerontology &amp; Geriatrics Education","last_mentioned_on":1489776327,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/02701960.2017.1285293"],"pmid":"28129090","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Education Systems","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Specialist Studies In Education","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["education","geriatrics"],"title":"Geriatric education utilizing a palliative care framework","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/02701960.2017.1285293","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/geriatric-education-utilizing-palliative-care-framework"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372629,"mean":7.0578283965246,"rank":6353801,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1135009,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372629,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243792,"mean":13.731381273303,"rank":177764,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":40181,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243792,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112,"mean":2.0594594594595,"rank":80,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":3.5,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1,"PG":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DrMroz\/statuses\/836969777776242688","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16897007],"posted_on":"2017-03-01T16:01:59+00:00","author":{"name":"Larry Mroz","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Lawrence_Larry_Mroz","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/539112786467364865\/QCqlxZRL_normal.jpeg","description":"Social Mediaist @BCC4PC; @HeardUBC; Researcher School of Nursing, UBC; #MensHealth #AdvanceCarePlanning #ProstateCancer Google Scholar:  https:\/\/t.co\/WicG7UoDx6","id_on_source":"DrMroz","tweeter_id":"391702198","geo":{"lt":49.24966,"ln":-123.11934,"country":"CA"},"followers":1965},"tweet_id":"836969777776242688"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BCC4PC\/statuses\/842809118125670402","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16897007],"posted_on":"2017-03-17T18:45:27+00:00","author":{"name":"BCC Palliative Care","url":"http:\/\/bc-cpc.ca","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/905539797455781888\/5Pj3tGtQ_normal.jpg","description":"BC Centre for Palliative Care: Education, evidence-based practice & policy development; research, better care, community.","id_on_source":"BCC4PC","tweeter_id":"2525771683","geo":{"lt":-6,"ln":147,"country":"PG"},"followers":3421},"tweet_id":"842809118125670402"}]}}
