However, their contribution to retention and resistance form has not been evaluated.\nThe purpose of this in\u00a0vitro study was to evaluate the retention and resistance failure loads of 2 preparation designs for maxillary anterior teeth.\nForty metal restorations were fabricated and paired with 40 cobalt-chromium prepared tooth analogs. Twenty of the specimens had parallel buccolingual walls at the cervical part (group PBLW; the control group), whereas the remaining 20 had converging buccolingual walls (group CBLW; the experimental group). The restorations were cemented to the tooth analogs with a resin modified glass ionomer luting agent. Ten specimens from each group were subjected to tensile loading with a universal testing machine; the rest were subjected to compression loading until failure. Descriptive statistics and the independent t test (\u03b1=.05) were used to determine the effect of failure loads in the tested groups.\nThe independent t test revealed statistically significant differences between the tested groups in tensile loading (P<.001) and in compressive loading (P<.001). The PBLW group presented a higher tensile failure load than the CBLW. On the contrary, the PBLW group presented a smaller compression failure load than the CBLW.\nParallelism of the buccolingual axial walls in anterior maxillary teeth increased the retention form but decreased the resistance form.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a95","authors":["Aimilia Bintivanou","Argirios Pissiotis","Konstantinos Michalakis"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.prosdent.2016.07.028","first_seen_on":"2017-03-01T17:32:19+00:00","issns":["00223913"],"journal":"Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry","last_mentioned_on":1489796256,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0022391316304322","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0022391316304322?_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_origin=gateway&_docanchor=&md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb"],"pmid":"27881331","pubdate":"2016-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"In\u00a0vitro assessment of retention and resistance failure loads of two preparation designs for maxillary anterior teeth","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0022391316304322","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/invitro-assessment-retention-resistance-failure-loads-two-preparation-designs-maxillary-anterior-tee"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":1.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8380241,"mean":7.0622268827546,"rank":3765716,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4521967,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8380241,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243892,"mean":13.73570128459,"rank":110406,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":129949,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243892,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":616,"mean":1.6226146341463,"rank":153,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":438,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":616,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":0.90694444444444,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CH":1,"BR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/soubt\/statuses\/836992175778988032","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16899647],"posted_on":"2017-03-01T17:30:59+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr. Ibrahem Soubt","url":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/dr.soubt","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/598205594567364608\/HKdz86K6_normal.jpg","description":"Dad, #Dentist & Director, focused on providing latest updates on #Aesthetic #Dentistry & #CADCAM, obsessed with Creativity & in delivering Value & Solutions","id_on_source":"soubt","tweeter_id":"234476487","geo":{"lt":47.16743,"ln":9.47794,"country":"CH"},"followers":767},"tweet_id":"836992175778988032"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/LeSourireOdonto\/statuses\/842892707521617921","license":"gnip","rt":["soubt"],"citation_ids":[16899647],"posted_on":"2017-03-18T00:17:36+00:00","author":{"name":"Le Sourire","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/841475884729147392\/htynle5y_normal.jpg","description":"Consult\u00f3rio Odontol\u00f3gico de alto padr\u00e3o","id_on_source":"LeSourireOdonto","tweeter_id":"841473233966751744","geo":{"lt":-22,"ln":-42.5,"country":"BR"},"followers":5},"tweet_id":"842892707521617921"}]}}
