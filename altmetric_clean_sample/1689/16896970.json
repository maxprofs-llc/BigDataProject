LV shape is a dynamic component of LV architecture on which contractile function depends.\nTransthoracic 2-dimensional echocardiography was used to quantify changes in LV architecture over 5 years of follow-up of patients with mild HF from the REVERSE study. REVERSE was a prospective study of patients with large\u00a0hearts (LV end-diastolic dimension\u00a0\u226555 mm), LV ejection fraction\u00a0<40%, and QRS duration >120 ms randomly assigned to CRT-ON (n\u00a0= 419) and CRT-OFF (n\u00a0= 191). CRT-OFF patients were excluded from this analysis. LV dimensions, volumes, mass index, and LV ejection fraction were calculated. LV architecture was assessed using the sphericity index, as\u00a0follows: (LV end-diastolic volume)\/(4\/3\u00a0\u00d7 \u03c0\u00a0\u00d7 r(3))\u00a0\u00d7 100%.\nLV architecture improved over time and demonstrated significant associations between LV shape, age, sex, and echocardiography metrics. Changes in LV architecture were strongly correlated with changes in LV end-systolic volume index and LV end-diastolic volume index (both p\u00a0< 0.0001). Sphericity index emerged as a predictor of death and HF hospitalization in spite of the low adverse event rate. A decrease in LV end-systolic volume index >15% occurred in more than two-thirds of patients, which indicates considerable reverse remodeling.\nWe demonstrated that change in LV architecture in patients with mild HF with CRT is associated with structural\u00a0and functional remodeling. Mean LV filling pressure was elevated, and the inability to lower it was an additional predictor of HF hospitalization or death.
