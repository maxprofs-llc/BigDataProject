Diagnostic concordance between pre-operative (hysteroscopic biopsy) and postoperative (uterine specimen) histology was evaluated. In endometrioid-endometrial cancers cases Kappa (k) statistics was applied to evaluate agreement for grading (G) between the preoperative and final pathology.\nA total 101 hysterectomies for uterine malignancies were evaluated. There were 23 non-endometrioid cancers: 7 serous (C:5\/7, 71.4%); 10 carcinosarcomas (C:7\/10, 70%, remaining 3 cases only epithelial component diagnosed); 3 clear cell (C:3\/3, 100%); 3 sarcomas (C:3\/3, 100%). In 78 cases an endometrioid endometrial cancer was found. In 63 cases there was a histological C (63\/78, 80.8%) between hysteroscopic-guided biopsy and final pathology, while in 15 cases (19.2%) only hyperplasia (with\/without atypia) was found preoperatively. Overall accuracy to detect endometrial cancer was 80.2%. In 50 out of 63 endometrial cancers (79.4%) grading was concordant. The overall level of agreement between preoperative and postoperative grading was \"substantial\" according to Kappa (k) statistics (k 0.64; 95% CI: 0.449-0.83; p\u2009<\u20090.001), as well as for G1 (0.679; 95% CI: 0.432-0.926; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and G3 (0.774; 94% CI: 0.534-1; p\u2009<\u20090.001), while for G2 (0.531; 95% CI: 0.286-0.777; p\u2009<\u20090.001) it was moderate.\nIn our series we found an 80% C between pre-operative hysteroscopic-guided biopsy and final pathology, in uterine malignancies. Moreover, hysteroscopic biopsy accurately predicted endometrial cancer in 80% of cases and \"substantially\" predicted histological grading. Hysteroscopic-guided uterine sampling could be a useful tool to tailor treatment in patients with uterine malignancies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cda","authors":["Fabio Martinelli","Antonino Ditto","Giorgio Bogani","Mauro Signorelli","Valentina Chiappa","Domenica Lorusso","Edward Haeusler","Francesco Raspagliesi"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00432-017-2371-0","first_seen_on":"2017-03-01T13:56:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0171-5216","1432-1335"],"journal":"Journal of Cancer Research & Clinical Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1500891374,"links":["http:\/\/www.readcube.com\/articles\/10.1007%2Fs00432-017-2371-0?author_access_token=VBzjSvYgX9ToyJLntq7E6fe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY6CGRtBHAkJov-rbm1sNpcgeNR61QRe_8KVP1pj7qhpdCHT7SjZamI9l5wq9EU6x6m0v8zQqQmGqUKtWtENZ767hztxwmGi1wrwWVJo-kPRYQ==","https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00432-017-2371-0"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00432-017-2371-0.pdf","pmid":"28247037","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Hematology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Accuracy of pre-operative hysteroscopic guided biopsy for predicting final pathology in uterine malignancies","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s00432-017-2371-0","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/accuracy-preoperative-hysteroscopic-guided-biopsy-predicting-final-pathology-uterine-malignancies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8266357,"mean":6.977935429341,"rank":4395598,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2301373,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8266357,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241556,"mean":13.689978994432,"rank":138984,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":79921,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241556,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":628,"mean":2.4425390749601,"rank":287,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":268,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":628,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":2.101875,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Unspecified":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DrFMartinelli\/statuses\/836937952282411009","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16892589],"posted_on":"2017-03-01T13:55:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Fabio Martinelli","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/766267808208580608\/kzNzB_Aw_normal.jpg","description":"MD, Gynecologic Oncology \nIRCCS Foundation -
