We analyzed CDX2 expression in a series of 469\u2009CC typed for the new international consensus molecular subtype (CMS) classification, and we confirmed results in a series of 90\u2009CC. Here, we show that lack of CDX2 expression is only present in the mesenchymal subgroup (CMS4) and in MSI-immune tumors (CMS1) and not in CMS2 and CMS3 colon cancer. Although CDX2 expression was a globally independent prognostic factor, loss of CDX2 expression is not associated with a worse prognosis in the CMS1 group, but is highly prognostic in CMS4 patients for both relapse free and overall survival. Similarly, lack of CDX2 expression was a bad prognostic factor in MSS patients, but not in MSI. Our work suggests that combination of the consensual CMS classification and lack of CDX2 expression could be a useful marker to identify CMS4\/CDX2-negative patients with a very poor prognosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002280","authors":["Pilati, C","Taieb, J","Balogoun, R","Marisa, L","de Reyni\u00e8s, A","Laurent-Puig, P","C.
