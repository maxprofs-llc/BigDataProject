In order to limit unwarranted outcomes, strict glycemic control is essential. In the past, human insulin was the only insulin formulation administered in pregnancy. However, insulin analogues have also been used for this indication in recent years. Areas covered: This article reviews the published data regarding the safety of insulin analogue use during pregnancy. We present the qualities, advantages and pitfalls of insulin analogue use in pregnancy compared with human insulin. Insulins lispro, aspart and detemir are safe in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes. Correspondingly, they were reclassified for the treatment of pregnant women with diabetes from category C to category B. For insulin glargine use in pregnancy, most studies are small and retrospective. Yet, no major safety concerns were reported. Insulin glulisine and degludec have not been studied in pregnancy. Expert opinion: Insulin analogues are viable therapeutic options for diabetes in pregnancy, specifically lispro, aspart and detemir. Though data in limited, their safety and efficacy are comparable with human insulin. Remarkably, the analogues are superior to human insulin regarding hypoglycaemia risk. More data, specifically for their use in pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes or type 2 diabetes, is needed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073c3","authors":["Yoel Toledano","Eran Hadar","Moshe Hod"],"doi":"10.1080\/14740338.2016.1182153","endpage":"11","first_seen_on":"2016-05-19T00:05:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1744-764X","1474-0338"],"journal":"Expert Opinion on Drug Safety","last_mentioned_on":1485375341,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/14740338.2016.1182153?ai=1pmh6&mi=ianpxd&af=R","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27145344"],"pmid":"27145344","pubdate":"2016-05-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Safety of insulin analogues as compared with human insulin in pregnancy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/safety-insulin-analogues-compared-human-insulin-pregnancy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8098931,"mean":6.8880547472244,"rank":6150625,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1087654,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8098931,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272049,"mean":11.617842983591,"rank":189057,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":46054,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272049,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":738,"mean":2.4005373134328,"rank":395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":271,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":738,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":1.0133333333333,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":10,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":11,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ExpertOpinion\/statuses\/733084977814855680","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7600686],"posted_on":"2016-05-19T00:00:53+00:00","author":{"name":"Expert Opinion","url":"http:\/\/explore.tandfonline.com\/content\/med\/medicine-hub\/expert-collection","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/489823721943625728\/-Bu_ucgW_normal.png","description":"11 peer-reviewed journals, analyzing the pharma research pipeline, phase by phase","id_on_source":"ExpertOpinion","tweeter_id":"29176129","geo":{"lt":51.50853,"ln":-0.12574,"country":"GB"},"followers":1842},"tweet_id":"733084977814855680"}],"facebook":[{"title":"ADA Guidelines Diabetes in Pregnancy GDM | NDEI","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=551458911714871&id=463770680483695","license":"public","citation_ids":[7600686],"posted_on":"2017-01-25T20:15:41+00:00","summary":"Sarcina cu diabet (1)\n\nAsumarea sarcinii cu diabet este o adev\u0103rat\u0103 provocare, mai ales c\u0103 \u021bintele gricemice sunt foarte stricte: 4,4 - 5,0 mmol\/L pe men\u00e2ncate; 7,2 - 7,8 mmol\/L la o or\u0103 dup\u0103 mese; 6,7 mmol\/L la dou\u0103 ore dup\u0103 mese \u0219i o hemoglobin\u0103 glicat\u0103","author":{"name":"Asocia\u021bia Tinerilor cu Diabet din Moldova DIA","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/463770680483695","facebook_wall_name":"Asocia\u021bia Tinerilor cu Diabet din Moldova DIA","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/463770680483695\/picture","id_on_source":"463770680483695"}}]}}
