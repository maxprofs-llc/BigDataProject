Combined LPS\/IFN-\u03b3 strongly upregulates IL-27 production, which has been linked to steroid-resistant airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). Andrographolide, a bioactive molecule isolated from the plant Andrographis paniculata, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The present study investigated whether andrographolide could restore steroid sensitivity to block LPS\/IFN-\u03b3-induced IL-27 production and AHR via its antioxidative property. The mouse macrophage cell line Raw 264.7, mouse primary lung monocytes\/macrophages, and BALB\/c mice were treated with LPS\/IFN-\u03b3, in the presence and absence of dexamethasone and\/or andrographolide. Levels of IL-27 in vitro and in vivo were examined and mouse AHR was assessed. Dexamethasone alone failed to inhibit LPS\/IFN-\u03b3-induced IL-27 production and AHR in mice. Andrographolide significantly restored the suppressive effect of dexamethasone on LPS\/IFN-\u03b3-induced IL-27 mRNA and protein levels in the macrophage cell line and primary lung monocytes\/macrophages, mouse bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissues, and AHR in mice. LPS\/IFN-\u03b3 markedly reduced the nuclear level of histone deacetylase (HDAC)2, an essential epigenetic enzyme that mediates steroid anti-inflammatory action. LPS\/IFN-\u03b3 also decreased total HDAC activity but increased the total histone acetyltransferase\/HDAC activity ratio in mouse lungs. Andrographolide significantly restored nuclear HDAC2 protein levels and total HDAC activity, and it diminished the total histone acetyltransferase\/HDAC activity ratio in mouse lungs exposed to LPS\/IFN-\u03b3, possibly via suppression of PI3K\/Akt\/HDAC2 phosphorylation, and upregulation of the antioxidant transcription factor NF erythroid-2-related factor 2 level and DNA binding activity. Our data suggest that andrographolide may have therapeutic value in resensitizing steroid action in respiratory disorders such as asthma.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cc7","authors":["Liao, Wupeng","Tan, W S Daniel","Wong, W S Fred","Tan, W.
