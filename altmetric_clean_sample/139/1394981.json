We explore the role of iron as a possible cofactor in this association. Malarial disease, among others, is associated with enhanced erythrophagocytosis and inflammation, which increases the iron content of macrophages and thereby also the survival of Salmonella spp. within macrophages. Whether iron supplementation programs augment the risk of invasive NTS infections in malaria-endemic regions is an important global health issue that still needs to be determined.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036b3","authors":["Susanne van Santen","Quirijn de Mast","Dorine W.
