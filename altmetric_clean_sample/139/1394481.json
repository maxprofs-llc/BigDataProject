Scenario 1 (biodiesel production), Scenario 2 (Scenario 1 with integrated anaerobic digestion system), Scenario 3 (biogas production), and Scenario 4 (supercritical gasification) were evaluated. Scenario 4 outperformed other scenarios in terms of net energy production (1282.42 kWh\/ton algae) and CO2 removal (1.32 ton CO2\/ton algae) while Scenario 2 surpassed the other three scenarios in terms of net cost. Scenario 1 produced the lowest energy while Scenario 3 was the most expensive bioenergy system. This study evaluated critical parameters that could direct the proper design of the microalgae bioenergy system with an efficient energy production, CO2 removal, and economic feasibility.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f5","doi":"10.1016\/j.biortech.2013.02.104","first_seen_on":"2013-04-17T12:44:49+00:00","issns":["1873-2976"],"journal":"Bioresource Technology","last_mentioned_on":1366202613,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23587833?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23587833","pubdate":"2013-03-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Life cycle analyses of CO2, energy, and cost for four different routes of microalgal bioenergy conversion.","type":"article","volume":"137C","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/life-cycle-analyses-co2-energy-cost-four-different-routes-microalgal-bioenergy-conversion"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":4203281,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93357,"mean":7.0502770255796,"rank":76422,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93357,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1326,"mean":1.9150732075472,"rank":862,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1326,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":3.8498,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Ph.
