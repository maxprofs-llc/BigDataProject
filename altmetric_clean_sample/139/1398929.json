Conventional preoperative evaluation is unreliable in identifying patients at risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension or predicting postoperative hemodynamic outcome. We postulated that pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure waveform analysis, a technique that has been used for partitioning pulmonary vascular resistance, might identify CTEPH patients with significant distal, small-vessel disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100057f2","authors":["Nick H.S.
