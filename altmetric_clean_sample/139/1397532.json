Loss and grief, adjusting to living alone, decreased income, and managing multiple chronic conditions can impact on older women's ability to transition following recent spousal bereavement. Providing appropriate, timely, and effective services to foster this life transition is of critical importance, yet few services directed towards these women exist in Australia, and there is little data describing the experiences of women and their support needs at this time.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007bb","authors":["Michelle DiGiacomo","Joanne Lewis","Marie T Nolan","Jane Phillips","Patricia M Davidson","Digiacomo M","Lewis J","Nolan MT","Phillips J","Davidson PM"],"doi":"10.1186\/1472-6963-13-143","first_seen_on":"2013-04-18T15:57:16+00:00","handle":"10453\/34724","handles":["10453\/34724"],"issns":["1472-6963",""],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Health Services Research","last_mentioned_on":1438982911,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/13\/143\/abstract","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/13\/143","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/1472-6963-13-143"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/1472-6963-13-143?site=bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"23597163","pubdate":"2013-04-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Library And Information Studies","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"143","subjects":["healthservicesresearch"],"title":"Health transitions in recently widowed older women: a mixed methods study","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/health-transitions-recently-widowed-older-women-mixed-methods-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":14,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":14},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8073174,"mean":6.8551736552583,"rank":577294,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7488708,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8073174,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119092,"mean":6.8976277132615,"rank":9651,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":109326,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119092,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3038,"mean":5.271318406322,"rank":229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":2807,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3038,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108,"mean":6.2203177570093,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":97,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
