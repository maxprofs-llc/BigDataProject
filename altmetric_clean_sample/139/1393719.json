Older patients are generally at higher risk of adverse drug reactions due to age-related changes in physiology that affect drug disposition, metabolism, and response. These analyses examined efficacy and safety outcomes of older (>=65 years) versus younger patients from clinical trials of duloxetine in the management of OA knee pain. METHODS: This is a post hoc analysis of two 13-week studies, in which patients were randomized to duloxetine 60 mg\/day or placebo. Both studies allowed potential dose changes after 7 weeks of dosing, with Study I re-randomizing duloxetine treated patients to either stay on 60 mg\/day or increase to 120 mg\/day; while Study II more closely mimicked clinical practice by escalating only non-responding patients to 120 mg\/day. For all analyses patients were subgrouped by age: older (>=65 years) and younger (40--64 years). Overall efficacy and safety age-group comparisons of duloxetine versus placebo were performed using pooled data from both studies with all duloxetine dose levels combined. Safety analyses included discontinuation rates, treatment-emergent adverse events, and serious adverse events. To evaluate the effects of increasing the dose in non-responding patients, only Study II data were evaluated. Treatment arms were defined post hoc as placebo, duloxetine 60 mg\/day, and duloxetine 60\/120 mg\/day. RESULTS: At study end, patients in each age group who were treated with duloxetine versus placebo had significantly greater improvement in pain (both, p<.05), and there was no significant effect of age on treatment (p=.72). Increasing the dose to 120 mg in non-responding patients was not found to have a significant advantage. Among treatment-emergent adverse events with duloxetine treatment, only dizziness had a significantly differential treatment effect (p=.02) with greater incidence over placebo in younger patients (6.6% versus 0.6%, p=.02), but not in older patients (1.0% versus 3.2%, p=.29). CONCLUSIONS: Duloxetine was efficacious and generally well tolerated for management of symptomatic knee OA in both older and younger patients, but increasing the dose to 120 mg in non-responding patients did not provide additional benefit.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007ca","authors":["Micca JL","Ruff D","Ahl J","Wohlreich MM"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2474-14-137","first_seen_on":"2013-04-17T06:44:05+00:00","issns":["1471-2474"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1427796531,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2474\/14\/137\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23590727?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23590727","pubdate":"2013-04-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"137","subjects":["orthopedics","physiology"],"title":"Safety and efficacy of duloxetine treatment in older and younger patients with osteoarthritis knee pain: a post hoc, subgroup analysis of two randomized, placebo-controlled trials.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/safety-efficacy-duloxetine-treatment-older-younger-patients-osteoarthritis-knee-pain-post-hoc-subgro-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4941811,"mean":5.8614681928312,"rank":2197445,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":2690314,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4941811,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92354,"mean":7.0599027860492,"rank":36386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":54662,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92354,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1665,"mean":4.3828918269231,"rank":817,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":783,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1665,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84,"mean":4.3478795180723,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
