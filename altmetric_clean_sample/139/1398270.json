However, excess PAMAM dendrimers is typically used to protect the loaded siRNA against enzymatic attack, which results in systemic toxicity that hinders the in vivo use of these particles. In this paper, we evaluate the ability of G4 (flexible) and G5 (rigid) dendrimers to complex model siRNA molecules at low +\/- ratio of 2\/1 upon incubation for 20 minutes and 24 hours. We examine the ability of the formed G4 and G5 dendriplexes to shield the loaded siRNA molecules and protect them from degradation by RNase V1 enzymes using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Results show that G4 and G5 dendrimers form similar hexagonal complexes upon incubation with siRNA molecules for 20 minutes with average full width of 43\u00b119.3 nm and 62\u00b18.3 at half the maximum height, respectively. AFM images show that these G4 and G5 dendriplexes were attacked by RNase V1 enzyme leading to degradation of the exposed RNA molecules that increased with the increase in incubation time. In comparison, incubating G4 and G5 dendrimers with siRNA for 24 hours led to the formation of large particles with average full width of 263\u00b160 nm and 48.3\u00b12.5 nm at half the maximum height, respectively. Both G4 and G5 dendriplexes had a dense central core that proved to shield the loaded RNA molecules from enzymatic attack for up to 60 minutes. These results show the feasibility of formulating G4 and G5 dendriplexes at a low N\/P (+\/-) ratio that can resist degradation by RNase enzymes, which reduces the risk of inducing non-specific toxicity when used in vivo.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Hosam G.
