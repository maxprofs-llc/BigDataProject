Two coordination polygons, a rhomboid and a triangle, establish a dynamic equilibrium. Quantitative sorting of the rhomboidal polygon is reversibly obtained by crystallization. Thermodynamic and kinetic aspects ruling the CDL system have been elucidated.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Marzio Rancan","Jacopo Tessarolo","Pier Luigi Zanonato","Roberta Seraglia","Silvio Quici","Lidia Armelao"],"doi":"10.1039\/c3dt50827g","first_seen_on":"2013-04-16T15:32:42+00:00","issns":["1477-9234","1477-9226"],"issue":"21","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1366126293,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2013\/DT\/C3DT50827G"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2013\/dt\/c3dt50827g","pmid":"23588786","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"7534","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Self-assembly of a constitutional dynamic library of Cu(II) coordination polygons and reversible sorting by crystallization","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/selfassembly-constitutional-dynamic-library-cuii-coordination-polygons-reversible-sorting-crystalliz"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3551903,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":136364,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80972,"mean":7.1791158809945,"rank":64332,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":628,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80972,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7985,"mean":0.95300375751503,"rank":4868,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7985,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
