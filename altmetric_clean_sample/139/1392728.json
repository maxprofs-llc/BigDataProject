In particular, the ability to manipulate these associations experimentally by introducing genetic variants of the symbionts into naive hosts has allowed the discovery of novel colonization mechanisms and factors. In addition, the role of the symbionts in inducing normal host development has been revealed, and its molecular basis described. In this Review, I discuss many of these developments, focusing on what has been discovered in five well-understood model systems.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f61000316c","authors":["Ruby EG","Edward G.
