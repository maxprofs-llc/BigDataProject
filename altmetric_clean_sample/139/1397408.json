Its contributions to life are especially well studied in the domain of cell division, in which the APC\/C lies at the epicenter of a regulatory network that controls the directionality and timing of cell cycle events. Biochemical and structural work is shedding light on the overall organization of APC\/C subunits and on the mechanism of substrate recognition and Ub chain initiation and extension as well as on the molecular mechanisms of a checkpoint that seizes control of APC\/C activity during mitosis. Here, we review how these recent advancements are modifying our understanding of the APC\/C.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002ce3","authors":["Ivana Primorac","Andrea Musacchio"],"doi":"10.1083\/jcb.201301130","first_seen_on":"2013-04-18T15:08:53+00:00","issns":["1540-8140"],"journal":"Journal of Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1366343127,"links":["http:\/\/jcb.rupress.org\/content\/201\/2\/177.full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jcb.rupress.org\/content\/201\/2\/177.full.pdf","pmid":"23589490","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Rockefeller Univ Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Panta rhei: The APC\/C at steady state","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/panta-rhei-apcc-steady-state"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":2309645,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1582241,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88887,"mean":6.9117105055916,"rank":44490,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":31680,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88887,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4523,"mean":3.5025586023883,"rank":2594,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":718,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4523,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":3.7374838709677,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":19,"Student  > Ph.
