We investigated the function of a major cysteine protease from S. pyogenes that affects the amount of C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) and other complement factors and aimed to elucidate the mechanism involved in occurrence of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome from the aspect of the complement system. First, we revealed that culture supernatant of a given S. pyogenes strain and recombinant SpeB degraded the C1-INH. Then, we determined the N-terminal sequence of the C1-INH fragment degraded by recombinant SpeB. Interestingly, the region containing one of the identified cleavage sites is not present in patients with C1-INH deficiency. Scanning electron microscopy of the speB mutant incubated in human serum showed the abnormal superficial architecture and irregular oval structure. Furthermore, unlike the wild-type strain, that mutant strain showed lower survival capacity than normal as compared with heat-inactivated serum, whereas it had a significantly higher survival rate in serum without the C1-INH than in normal serum. Also, SpeB degraded multiple complement factors and the membrane attack complex. Flow cytometric analyses revealed deposition of C9, one of the components of membrane the attack complex, in greater amounts on the surface of the speB mutant, whereas lower amounts of C9 were bound to the wild-type strain surface. These results suggest that SpeB can interrupt the human complement system via degrading the C1-INH, thus enabling S. pyogenes to evade eradication in a hostile environment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Mariko Honda-Ogawa","Taiji Ogawa","Yutaka Terao","Tomoko Sumitomo","Masanobu Nakata","Kazunori Ikebe","Yoshinobu Maeda","Shigetada Kawabata"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m113.469106","first_seen_on":"2013-04-16T16:05:13+00:00","issns":["1083-351X"],"journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1366128242,"links":["http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/early\/2013\/04\/15\/jbc.M113.469106.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/early\/2013\/04\/15\/jbc.M113.469106.full.pdf","pmid":"23589297","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Cysteine proteinase from Streptococcus pyogenes enables to evade innate immunity via degradation of complement factors","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cysteine-proteinase-streptococcus-pyogenes-enables-evasion-innate-immunity-via-degradation-complemen"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":3078156,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":957391,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80972,"mean":7.1748087833917,"rank":55396,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":16904,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80972,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30238,"mean":2.4954086714952,"rank":23401,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":5592,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30238,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":2.9175925925926,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
