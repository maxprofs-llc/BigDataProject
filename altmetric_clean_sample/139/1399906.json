Although the typical result of such efforts is a robust performance evaluation of diverse methodologies, challenge-based competitions reach far beyond algorithm assessment. Here, we discuss the impact of challenge-based competitions in the areas of organizing and building communities and driving innovation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000580f","authors":["J C Costello","G Stolovitzky"],"doi":"10.1038\/clpt.2013.36","endpage":"398","first_seen_on":"2013-04-19T15:54:49+00:00","issns":["0009-9236","1532-6535"],"journal":"Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1366386796,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/clpt\/journal\/v93\/n5\/full\/clpt201336a.html"],"pmid":"23549146","pubdate":"2013-02-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"396","subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Seeking the Wisdom of Crowds Through Challenge-Based Competitions in Biomedical Research","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/seeking-wisdom-crowds-through-challengebased-competitions-biomedical-research"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628014,"mean":4.9445414826282,"rank":2904846,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75138,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628014,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84945,"mean":6.718009888868,"rank":65901,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":260,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84945,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":977,"mean":3.2331024590164,"rank":808,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":977,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":2.562962962963,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Ph.
