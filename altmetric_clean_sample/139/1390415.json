In silico methods allow rapid and efficient characterization of SARs and facilitate building a variety of models to capture and encode one or more SARs, which can then be used to predict activities for new molecules. By coupling these methods with in silico modifications of structures, one can easily prioritize large screening decks or even generate new compounds de novo and ascertain whether they belong to the SAR being studied. Computational methods can provide a guide for the experienced user by integrating and summarizing large amounts of preexisting data to suggest useful structural modifications. This chapter highlights the different types of SAR modeling methods and how they support the task of exploring chemical space to elucidate and optimize SARs in a drug discovery setting. In addition to considering modeling algorithms, I briefly discuss how to use databases as a source of SAR data to inform and enhance the exploration of SAR trends. I also review common modeling techniques that are used to encode SARs, recent work in the area of structure-activity landscapes, the role of SAR databases, and alternative approaches to exploring SAR data that do not involve explicit model development.","abstract_source":"pubmed","aggregated_in":[5621145],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd3b","authors":["Rajarshi Guha"],"book":{"title":"In Silico Models for Drug Discovery","isbns":["9781627033411","9781627033428"],"uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/book\/10.1007%2F978-1-62703-342-8","attribution":"HLOM"},"doi":"10.1007\/978-1-62703-342-8_6","editors":["Sandhya Kortagere"],"first_seen_on":"2013-04-16T12:19:26+00:00","issns":["1064-3745","1940-6029"],"journal":"Methods in molecular biology","last_mentioned_on":1366116312,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/protocol\/10.1007\/978-1-62703-342-8_6"],"ordinal_number":6,"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2F978-1-62703-342-8_6","pmid":"23568465","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Humana Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicinal Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology\/Toxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"series":{"title":"Methods in Molecular Biology","issn":"1064-3745"},"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"On Exploring Structure\u00e2\u0080\u0093Activity Relationships","type":"chapter","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/protocol\/10.1007%2F978-1-62703-342-8_6","volume":"993","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exploring-structureactivity-relationships"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7392066,"mean":6.4230950225638,"rank":3359134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3867646,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7392066,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106264,"mean":6.828346799921,"rank":42785,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":60444,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106264,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5031,"mean":1.7024425447316,"rank":1197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":3691,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5031,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":2.0949411764706,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
