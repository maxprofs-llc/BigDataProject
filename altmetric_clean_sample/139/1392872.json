The present mechanistic study gives insights for the rational development of this key transformation. The catalyst resting states and the rate law of the reaction have been identified. The reaction rate is solely dependent on the catalyst and alkene concentrations, and the turnover-limiting step is the migratory insertion of the alkene into a Rh-C(aryl) bond.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Mika\u00ebl Brasse","Juan C\u00e1mpora","Jonathan A.
