The nucleotide binding domains (NBD) of Streptococcus mutans ComA with different N termini, NBD1 (amino acid residues 495-760), NBD2 (517-760), and NBD3 (528-760), were expressed, purified, and characterized. The shortest NBD3 corresponds to the region commonly defined as NBD in the database searches of ABC transporters. A kinetic analysis showed that the extra N-terminal region conferred a significantly higher ATP hydrolytic activity on the NBD at a neutral pH. Gel-filtration, X-ray crystallography, and mutational analyses suggest that at least four to five residues beyond the N-terminal boundary of NBD3 indeed participate in stabilizing the protein scaffold of the domain structure, thereby facilitating the ATP-dependent dimerization of NBD which is a prerequisite to the catalysis. These findings, together with the presence of a highly conserved glycine residue in this region, support the redefinition of the N-terminal boundary of the NBD of these types of ABC exporters.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c7","doi":"10.1021\/bi3017069","first_seen_on":"2013-04-18T16:34:59+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Biochemistry (00062979)","last_mentioned_on":1366302812,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/bi3017069"],"pmid":"23534432","pubdate":"2013-03-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Boundary of the nucleotide-binding domain of Streptococcus ComA based on functional and structural analysis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/boundary-nucleotidebinding-domain-streptococcus-coma-based-functional-structural-analysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5557110,"mean":6.3233444181145,"rank":2923324,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1868703,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5557110,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96152,"mean":7.1279278426642,"rank":47829,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":36230,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96152,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5981,"mean":2.5518739130435,"rank":4194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":1084,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5981,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":2.0242666666667,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
