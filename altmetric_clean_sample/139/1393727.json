Calcium crystals deposition is thought to be a factor that likely contributes to synovial inflammation. In recent years, significant interest has emerged in the beneficial health effects attributed to the green tea polyphenols and in particular to epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). It has been demonstrated that some of the actions of EGCG are linked to its ability to interfere with cell membranes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of EGCG in some inflammatory aspects of OA and whether EGCG is able to interfere with membrane organization. We assessed the effect of EGCG on the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines released by human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) and THP-1 cells stimulated with calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystals in presence of methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD), a cholesterol-removing agent that disturbs lipid raft structures. The chemotactic effect of culture supernatants was also evaluated. EGCG inhibited interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, transforming growth factor beta, IL-8, and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) release by stimulated FLS and\/or THP-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Supernatants of CPP-stimulated cells induced the migration of neutrophils and mononuclear cells which decreased in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of EGCG. EGCG increased cell viability when added to THP-1 cells treated with M\u03b2CD. Furthermore, M\u03b2CD enhanced the inflammatory response to CPP crystals increasing IL-8 and CCL2 secretion which was inhibited by EGCG in a dose-dependent manner. This study showed that EGCG is able to reduce the inflammatory response induced by CPP crystals in vitro. The identification of EGCG as dietary supplement capable of affording protection or modulating the inflammatory response to CPP crystals may have important implications in the prevention and treatment of OA and crystal-related arthropathies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc18","authors":["Francesca Oliviero","Paolo Sfriso","Anna Scanu","Ugo Fiocco","Paolo Spinella","Leonardo Punzi","Oliviero, Francesca","Sfriso, Paolo","Scanu, Anna","Fiocco, Ugo","Spinella, Paolo","Punzi, Leonardo"],"doi":"10.3389\/fphar.2013.00051","first_seen_on":"2013-04-17T06:49:38+00:00","issns":["1663-9812"],"journal":"Frontiers in Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1366181291,"links":["http:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/Inflammation_Pharmacology\/10.3389\/fphar.2013.00051\/abstract","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3389\/fphar.2013.00051"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/DownloadFile\/1\/1857\/45852\/1\/21\/fphar-04-00051_pdf","pmid":"23616769","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Epigallocatechin-3-gallate reduces inflammation induced by calcium pyrophosphate crystals in vitro","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epigallocatechin3gallate-reduces-inflammation-induced-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystals-vitro-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7597208,"mean":6.546683615435,"rank":3708327,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3696494,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7597208,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116627,"mean":6.6879189374583,"rank":51540,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":61447,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116627,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1628,"mean":3.25187707437,"rank":481,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":1056,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1628,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CH":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/FrontPharmacol\/statuses\/324413967348932608","license":"public","citation_ids":[1393727],"posted_on":"2013-04-17T06:48:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Frontiers Pharmacol","url":"http:\/\/frontiersin.org\/Pharmacology","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/533294581958209537\/hDIH8LPD_normal.jpeg","description":"The official Twitter Feed for all the latest open-access, peer-reviewed articles in Frontiers in Pharmacology","id_on_source":"FrontPharmacol","tweeter_id":"397328143","geo":{"lt":46.516,"ln":6.63282,"country":"CH"},"followers":966},"tweet_id":"324413967348932608"}],"peer_reviews":[{"title":"Epigallocatechin-3-gallate reduces inflammation induced by calcium pyrophosphate crystals in vitro","url":"https:\/\/publons.com\/publon\/review\/7E98gUHy\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[1393727],"posted_on":"2013-04-15T00:00:00+00:00","author":{"name":"Soon Yew Tang","url":"https:\/\/publons.com\/author\/115886\/","id_on_source":115886},"pr_id":"publons","publons_quality_score":null,"publons_significance_score":null,"publons_review_type":null,"publons_weighted_average":null,"publons_article_url":"https:\/\/publons.com\/publon\/19349\/","pubpeer_publication_url":null},{"title":"Epigallocatechin-3-gallate reduces inflammation induced by calcium pyrophosphate crystals in vitro","url":"https:\/\/publons.com\/publon\/review\/yWiQGhLN\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[1393727],"posted_on":"2013-04-15T00:00:00+00:00","author":{"name":"Mi Shi","url":"https:\/\/publons.com\/author\/115885\/","id_on_source":115885},"pr_id":"publons","publons_quality_score":null,"publons_significance_score":null,"publons_review_type":null,"publons_weighted_average":null,"publons_article_url":"https:\/\/publons.com\/publon\/19349\/","pubpeer_publication_url":null}]}}
