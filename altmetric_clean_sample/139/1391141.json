Analysis of transcripts from 20 meetings reveals physician identity is developed through ideological discourse that produces and reproduces systems of domination that privilege scientific medicine and marginalize humanistic approaches. Findings indicate how, in a socialization context uniquely focused on discourse, communication functions to construct a professional identity grounded in the principles of the biomedical model. Although medical residents deviate from traditional ideology by articulating the voice of the lifeworld, faculty physicians counter these moves by asserting the voice of medicine. The authors draw conclusions regarding identity formation and the socialization practices of medical education.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003405","authors":["Julie Apker","Susan Eggly"],"doi":"10.1177\/1049732303260577","endpage":"429","first_seen_on":"2013-04-16T16:13:08+00:00","issns":["1552-7557","1049-7323","00000000"],"issue":"3","journal":"Qualitative Health Research","last_mentioned_on":1366128712,"links":["http:\/\/qhr.sagepub.com\/content\/14\/3\/411.short"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/qhr.sagepub.com\/content\/14\/3\/411.full.pdf","pmid":"15011907","pubdate":"2004-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Sage Publications Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Studies In Human Society","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"411","subjects":["healthservicesresearch"],"title":"Communicating Professional Identity in Medical Socialization: Considering the Ideological Discourse of Morning Report","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/communicating-professional-identity-medical-socialization-considering-ideological-discourse-morning"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3076752,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":955401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80972,"mean":7.1791158809945,"rank":55224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":16640,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80972,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":596,"mean":3.4145613445378,"rank":452,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":86,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":596,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":2.55,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":11,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
