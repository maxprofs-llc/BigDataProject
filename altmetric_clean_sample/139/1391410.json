In a rat model of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced AKI, we found that ACTH gel prevented kidney injury, corrected acute renal dysfunction, and improved survival. Morphologically, ACTH gel ameliorated TNF-induced acute tubular necrosis, associated with a reduction in tubular apoptosis. While the steroidogenic response to ACTH gel plateaued, the kidney-protective effect continued to increase at even higher doses, suggesting steroid-independent mechanisms. Of note, ACTH also acts as a key agonist of the melanocortin system, with its cognate melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) abundantly expressed in renal tubules. In TNF-injured tubular epithelial cells in vitro, ACTH reinstated cellular viability and eliminated apoptosis. This beneficial effect was blunted in MC1R-silenced cells, suggesting that this receptor mediates the anti-apoptotic signaling of ACTH. Moreover, ACTH gel protected mice against cecal ligation puncture-induced septic AKI better than \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone: a protein equal in biological activity to ACTH except for steroidogenesis. Thus, ACTH has additive renoprotective actions achieved by both steroid-dependent mechanisms and MC1R-directed anti-apoptosis. ACTH may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to prevent or treat AKI.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fb9","authors":["Jin Si","Yan Ge","Shougang Zhuang","Li Juan Wang","Shan Chen","Rujun Gong"],"doi":"10.1038\/ki.2012.447","first_seen_on":"2013-04-16T17:28:39+00:00","issns":["0085-2538"],"issue":"4","journal":"Kidney International","last_mentioned_on":1366203791,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3612362\/"],"pmid":"23325074","pubdate":"2013-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"635","subjects":["nephrology"],"title":"Adrenocorticotropic hormone ameliorates acute kidney injury by steroidogenic-dependent and -independent mechanisms","type":"article","volume":"83","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adrenocorticotropic-hormone-ameliorates-acute-kidney-injury-steroidogenicdependent-independent-mecha"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.55,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6897340,"mean":6.1917255605365,"rank":1475186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":5413167,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6897340,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104772,"mean":6.758381708679,"rank":24394,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":80239,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104772,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2211,"mean":4.1214389140271,"rank":565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":1645,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2211,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":3.5702580645161,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
