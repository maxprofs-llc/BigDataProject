Document retrieval and screening were performed in the Chinese databases CNKI and Wanfang Data using \"cholestasis\" and \"infant\" as key words. Excel 2010 was used to establish a co-occurrence matrix of high-frequency key words, and Ucinet 6.0 and Netdraw were used to develop a visualized network of these high-frequency key words.\nA total of 383 articles were included. The co-occurrence analysis showed that \"infant\" and \"cholestasis\" were the core of research in this field, and \"infantile hepatitis syndrome\", \"neonate\", \"intrahepatic\", \"biliary atresia\", \"heredity and metabolism\", \"hepatitis\", \"cytomegalovirus\", \"jaundice\", and \"conjugated bilirubin\" were main research topics. Most of the other articles focused on \"parenteral nutrition\", \"hepatobiliary imaging\", \"gene mutation\", and \"liver biopsy\". There were relatively few articles on surgical diagnostic techniques and treatment for this disease.\nThe research on infantile cholestatic liver disease in China focuses on etiology and differential diagnosis, and genetic diagnosis has become a hot topic in recent years. The research on treatment should be enhanced, and new diagnostic techniques are the research interest in future.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9263cf058f61000dd04","authors":["Liao, Qiong","Wan, Chao-Min","Zhu, Yu","Yang, Xiao-Yan","Shu, Min"],"first_seen_on":"2017-05-17T10:14:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1008-8830"],"issue":"5","journal":"Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics","last_mentioned_on":1495016049,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28506343?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28506343","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"[Current status of research on infantile cholestatic liver disease in China: a visualization analysis].","type":"article","volume":"19"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8219010,"mean":6.9619102524339,"rank":7112906,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8219010,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233549,"mean":12.371042689297,"rank":189895,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233549,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":289,"mean":0.87583333333333,"rank":124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":289,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.5625,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/libroazuln\/statuses\/864786108676063233","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20211330],"posted_on":"2017-05-17T10:14:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Libro Azul","url":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Libro-Azul\/279667772085894?sk=app_190322544333196","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1733482297\/Bright_512x512_normal.png","description":"La desnutrici\u00f3n es un factor que se asocia con mal pron\u00f3stico en pacientes hospitalizados y ambulatorios","id_on_source":"libroazuln","tweeter_id":"454601506","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":161},"tweet_id":"864786108676063233"}]}}
