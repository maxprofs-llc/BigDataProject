In the present study, we directly compared the effects of insulin and its analogs on neural functions in vitro and in vivo.\nCultured rat cerebral cortical neurons were treated with insulin, insulin glargine U100 (Gla), insulin detemir (Det), or insulin degludec (Deg). Moreover, these drugs were intracerebroventricularly administered to mice. Their efficacies were evaluated by biochemical and behavioral analyses.\nIn cultured neurons, insulin, Gla, and Det increased phosphorylation of Akt and enhanced gene expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor to a similar extent, although Deg was less effective. The effects of Det and Deg, but not insulin and Gla were suppressed by addition of albumin. When the drug was centrally administered, the increasing effects of insulin on the Akt phosphorylation were comparable to those of Gla but greater than those of Det in hippocampus and cerebral cortex of diabetic db\/db and non-diabetic db\/m+ mice. Moreover, insulin and Gla enhanced memory functions in Y-maze test and suppressed depression-like behavior in forced swim test in normal mice to a similar extent, and these effects were more potent than those of Det.\nInsulin and Gla have greater impacts on central nervous system than insulin analogs with high albumin sensitivity, such as Det and Deg. These pharmacological profiles should be taken into account for developing an insulin-based therapy to treat Alzheimer's disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026fa","authors":["Hiroshi Tsuneki","Hitomi Yoshida","Kosuke Endo","Norihiko Mori","Shuji Hosoh","Masaaki Tsuda","Tsutomu Wada","Toshiyasu Sasaoka"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.diabres.2017.03.032","first_seen_on":"2017-05-17T10:35:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["01688227","1872-8227"],"journal":"Diabetes Research & Clinical Practice","last_mentioned_on":1495021161,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28511140?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28511140?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28511140","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Different impacts of acylated and non-acylated long-acting insulin analogs on neural functions in vitro and in vivo","type":"article","volume":"129","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/different-impacts-acylated-nonacylated-longacting-insulin-analogs-neural-functions-vitro-vivo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8219010,"mean":6.9619102524339,"rank":4132465,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3877036,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8219010,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233549,"mean":12.370999657458,"rank":117877,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":105739,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233549,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1072,"mean":4.4441867413632,"rank":582,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":466,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1072,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":3.53,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Neuroscience":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NeuroGen_papers\/statuses\/864791500915220481","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20211946],"posted_on":"2017-05-17T10:35:35+00:00","author":{"name":"NeuroGenetics papers","url":"http:\/\/neurogeneticslab.wordpress.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/508573077727223808\/P7-OnZSA_normal.png","description":"Twitterbot from @TheGBLab!
