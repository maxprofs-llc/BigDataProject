This observational, comparative study assessed psychosocial functioning in 33 euthymic older adults with bipolar disorder compared with 30 healthy controls. In addition, we evaluated the association between clinical variables and poor functioning in the patient group. The mean age of the group was 68.70 years. Patients with bipolar disorder experienced poorer psychosocial functioning (19.15 \u00b1 11.36) than healthy controls (5.17 \u00b1 3.72; p = 0.0001), as assessed using the Functioning Assessment Short Test. Significant differences between the groups were found for specific domains of functioning: autonomy, occupational functioning, cognitive functioning, financial issues, and interpersonal relationships (p = 0.0001, respectively). The largest variation was observed in overall functioning (Cohen's d = 0.63). The number of previous hospitalizations was strongly associated with poor overall functioning (F = 7.217, p = 0.002). Older patients with bipolar disorder had a greater functional impairment than the healthy control group. Implementation of novel rehabilitation models is critical to help patients manage their illness.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e6f","authors":["Merc\u00e8 Comes","Adriane Rosa","Maria Reinares","Carla Torrent","Eduard Vieta","Comes, Merc\u00e8","Rosa, Adriane","Reinares, Maria","Torrent, Carla","Vieta, Eduard"],"doi":"10.1097\/nmd.0000000000000683","first_seen_on":"2017-05-17T12:11:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0022-3018"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Nervous & Mental Disease","last_mentioned_on":1499340793,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28459727","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jonmd\/Abstract\/2017\/06000\/Functional_Impairment_in_Older_Adults_With_Bipolar.4.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jonmd\/Fulltext\/2017\/06000\/Functional_Impairment_in_Older_Adults_With_Bipolar.4.aspx?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jonmd\/2017\/06000\/Functional_Impairment_in_Older_Adults_With_Bipolar.4.pdf","pmid":"28459727","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"443","subjects":["psychiatry","neurology"],"title":"Functional Impairment in Older Adults With Bipolar Disorder","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jonmd\/Fulltext\/2017\/06000\/Functional_Impairment_in_Older_Adults_With_Bipolar.4.aspx","volume":"205","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/functional-impairment-older-adults-bipolar-disorder-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":2.6,"6m":2.6,"3m":2.6,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8170401,"mean":6.9145194585267,"rank":3284623,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4860714,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8170401,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230317,"mean":12.321347427013,"rank":82810,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":146147,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230317,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2084,"mean":4.2863590974556,"rank":958,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":1115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2084,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":4.1512195121951,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":2,"Psychology":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1,"IE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BipolarBCN\/statuses\/864812482128478208","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20219784],"posted_on":"2017-05-17T11:58:57+00:00","author":{"name":"BipolarBarcelona","url":"http:\/\/www.bipolarclinic.org\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/606797222810947584\/BIsGEgKv_normal.png","description":"Official Twitter Account of the Barcelona @Bipolar Disorders Program, @hospitalclinic","id_on_source":"BipolarBCN","tweeter_id":"3309198551","geo":{"lt":41.38879,"ln":2.15899,"country":"ES"},"followers":308},"tweet_id":"864812482128478208"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ThihaSwe_dr\/statuses\/869989252574191616","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20219784],"posted_on":"2017-05-31T18:49:36+00:00","author":{"name":"Psychiatry Updates","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/PsychiatryUpdates.by.DrThihaSwe","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3471096253\/6b7bd3fc313986902cd1574474364bae_normal.jpeg","description":"[RSS Updates from Psychiatry Journals globally, plus some mental health related news] \/ Should follow only if you are interested in Mental Health","id_on_source":"ThihaSwe_dr","tweeter_id":"1259166031","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":997},"tweet_id":"869989252574191616"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/gemsonkat\/statuses\/870044664807772161","license":"gnip","rt":["ThihaSwe_dr"],"citation_ids":[20219784],"posted_on":"2017-05-31T22:29:47+00:00","author":{"name":"Gemma Duggan","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/645741144245170176\/aV0sh0DS_normal.jpg","description":"Qualified Beautician, Masseuse , and Sports Therapist.
