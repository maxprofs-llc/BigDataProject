We analysed group differences, cross-informant correlations, and relative risks for elevated anxiety symptoms.\nSelf-reported anxiety symptoms did not significantly differ, although the upper confidence limit (95% CI [-3.3 to 5.1]) supported an odds ratio of 2 for the preterm-born participants. Mothers of the preterm-born participants reported higher social anxiety symptoms than did mothers of controls (51.7 vs. 46.8, p = 0.001). The relative risk for being above a threshold indicating distressing anxiety were small from self-reports (1.39; p= 0.60). From mother-reports, the relative risk was noticeable but not significant (4.58; p = 0.14). Cross informant scores correlated significant for total anxiety and social anxiety for the preterm-born (r\u03c4 = 0.2, p = 0.001; r\u03c4 = 0.3, p = <0.001).\nSelf-reports did not clearly indicate more anxiety in the preterm group, although confidence intervals supported a possible two-fold increase. Mother- and self-reports correlated only for the preterm group, which may indicate increased sensitivity for their children's symptoms. This article is protected by copyright.
