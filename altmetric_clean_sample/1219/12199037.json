The pNSCs are upstream of the dNSCs in the neural stem cell lineage. Herein we show that pNSC and dNSC populations can also be isolated from the developing and adult spinal cord. Spinal cord derived pNSCs are similarly rare, Oct4 expressing cells that are responsive to leukemia inhibitory factor and dNSCs are 4-5X more abundant and express GFAP. We demonstrate that myelin basic protein (MBP) is inhibitory to both pNSC and dNSC derived colony formation. Similar to what is seen in the adult forebrain following injury, spinal cord injury results in a significant increase in the size of the dNSC and pNSC pools. Hence, both primitive and definitive neural stem cells can be isolated from along the embryonic and adult neuraxis in vivo and their behaviour is regulated by MBP and injury.
