Image quality and radiation dose were evaluated for each group.\nFor both cervical and intracranial vessels, CT attenuation, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were higher in the AIDR 3D groups. The difference in mean vascular noise was also statistically significant (p<0.001), with group B having the lowest value at 16.5\u00b13.2 HU and group C having the highest at 19.1\u00b12.9 HU. FBP reconstruction resulted in lower image-quality scores for the common carotid artery. Parenchymal image-quality scores also varied significantly different between groups with group C partially failing to meet the minimum standards for diagnostic use. For the middle cerebral artery, image-quality scores were significantly better in group A, although images from groups B and C also satisfied clinical diagnostic requirements. The image quality of the internal carotid artery was the best in group B. Image-quality scores between groups were not significantly different for the carotid sinus. Radiation doses in the groups using AIDR 3D were >70% lower than in the FBP group.\nAIDR 3D (100\u00a0kV, automatic modulation) provides optimal image quality of vascular and parenchymal tissues at significantly lower radiation doses (mSV) than FBP in craniocervical CTA. For cases in which highly accurate parenchymal assessment is not required, the tube voltage can be lowered to 80\u00a0kV to further decrease radiation dose.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002577","authors":["Yu, S","Zhang, L","Zheng, J","Xu, Y","Chen, Y","Song,
