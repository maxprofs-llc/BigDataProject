The innate immune system is often ignored in the design of novel immune-based therapies. There is increasing evidence for multiple natural killer (NK) subpopulations, but their role is poorly understood in autoimmunity and likely is contributing to the controversial role reported for NKs. In this review, we will summarize NK subsets and their roles in tolerance, autoimmune diabetes, and immunotherapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007053","authors":["Fraker, Chris","Bayer, Allison L"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11892-016-0806-7","first_seen_on":"2016-09-25T10:44:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1539-0829","1534-4827"],"issue":"11","journal":"Current Diabetes Reports","last_mentioned_on":1474797707,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27664042?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27664042","pubdate":"2016-09-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Diabetes","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"The Expanding Role of Natural Killer Cells in Type 1 Diabetes and Immunotherapy","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expanding-role-natural-killer-cells-type-1-diabetes-immunotherapy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8430317,"mean":7.0913096536278,"rank":7284488,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8430317,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253398,"mean":12.711815830495,"rank":208351,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253398,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":541,"mean":3.9275481481481,"rank":445,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":541,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":3.4773913043478,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NK_papers\/statuses\/779984233196584960","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12199162],"posted_on":"2016-09-25T10:01:47+00:00","author":{"name":"NK papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/573591369375031296\/MLLMIFLv_normal.png","description":"Paper Twitterbot for academics with an interest in NK cell biology.","id_on_source":"NK_papers","tweeter_id":"2369366659","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":225},"tweet_id":"779984233196584960"}]}}
