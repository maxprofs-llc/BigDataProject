In this study, we hypothesized that repeated treatments with IngMeb may prevent progression of UV-induced photodamage, and that concurrent application of a corticosteroid may reduce IngMeb-induced local skin responses (LSR).\nHairless mice (n = 60; 3 groups of 20 mice) were irradiated with solar simulated ultraviolet radiation (UVR) throughout the study. Five single treatments with IngMeb were given at 4-week intervals (Days 21, 49, 77, 105, and 133). Clobetasol propionate (CP) was applied once daily for 5 days prior to each IngMeb application, as well as 6 h and 1 day post treatment. One week after IngMeb treatment No. 1, 3, and 5 (Days 28, 84, and 140), biopsies from four mice in each group were collected for histological evaluation of UV-damage on a standardized UV-damage scale (0-12). LSR (0-24) were assessed once daily (Days 1-7) after each IngMeb treatment.\nIngMeb prevented progression of photodamage in terms of keratosis grade, epidermal hypertrophy, dysplasia, and dermal actinic damage with a lower composite UV-damage score on day 140 (UVR 10.25 vs. UVR+IngMeb 6.00, p = 0.002) compared to UVR alone. IngMeb induced LSR, including erythema, flaking, crusting, bleeding, vesiculation, and ulceration. Concurrent CP increased LSR (max LSR Tx 1-5: UVR+IngMeb+CP 3.6-5.5 vs. UVR+IngMeb 2.6-4.3) and provided better prevention of photodamage compared to IngMeb alone (Day 140: UVR+IngMeb 6.00 vs. UVR+IngMeb+CP 3.00 p < 0.001).\nRepeated field-directed treatments with IngMeb prevent progression of cutaneous photodamage in hairless mice, while CP cannot be used to alleviate IngMeb-induced LSR. The findings suggest that IngMeb may potentially serve as a prophylactic treatment for UV-induced tumors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Andr\u00e9s M\u00e1r Erlendsson","Daniel Thaysen-Petersen","Christiane Bay","Andreas Hald","Kresten Skak","John Robert Zibert","Uwe Paasch","Hans Christian Wulf","Merete Haedersdal"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0162597","first_seen_on":"2016-09-25T05:15:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"9","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1474780514,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0162597","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0162597"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0162597.PDF","pmid":"27636884","pubdate":"2016-09-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0162597","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Repeated Treatments with Ingenol Mebutate Prevents Progression of UV-Induced Photodamage in Hairless Mice","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/repeated-treatments-ingenol-mebutate-prevents-progression-uvinduced-photodamage-hairless-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8430317,"mean":7.0913096536278,"rank":7284498,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8430317,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253398,"mean":12.711848980059,"rank":208361,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253398,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116192,"mean":10.656067871006,"rank":97907,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116192,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4149,"mean":9.9236904532305,"rank":3566,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4149,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
