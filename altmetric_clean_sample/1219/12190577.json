We report a case of tracheal malplacement of the King airway with a severe kink in the distal tube.\nA 51-year-old unhelmeted motorcyclist collided with a freeway median and was obtunded when paramedics arrived. After bag mask ventilation, a King airway was placed uneventfully and the patient was transported to the emergency department. Because of the concern for an unstable cervical spine injury, a lateral cervical spine radiograph was obtained on arrival. No cervical injury was seen, but the King airway was noted to be malplaced; the King airway passed through the laryngeal inlet and became lodged on the anterior trachea, creating an acute kink between the two balloons. After reviewing the radiograph, ventilations were reassessed and remained adequate. Both balloons were deflated, and the King airway was removed; the patient was orotracheally intubated without complication. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: The King airway is a valuable prehospital airway that can be placed quickly and blindly with high success rates by inexperienced providers; the King airway, however, is not without complication. Ventilation was not impaired in this patient, but tracheal malplacement may be an important cause of prehospital device failure. If a first placement attempt of a King airway device fails, it is reasonable to reattempt King airway placement with a new, unkinked device before abandoning King airway placement.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d74","authors":["Driver, Brian E","Plummer, David","Heegaard, William","Reardon, Robert F"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jemermed.2016.07.006","first_seen_on":"2016-09-24T19:19:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0736-4679","07364679"],"journal":"Journal of Emergency Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1474745427,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27650719?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0736467916304541&_version=1&md5=9ce437904a3ffa3c9c3afd6cd398aca3"],"pmid":"27650719","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["emergencymedicine"],"title":"Tracheal Malplacement of the King LT Airway May Be an Important Cause of Prehospital Device Failure","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tracheal-malplacement-king-lt-airway-important-cause-prehospital-device-failure"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8425604,"mean":7.0878923279354,"rank":7280478,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8425604,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253607,"mean":12.6636842346,"rank":208680,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253607,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1872,"mean":6.7658685195083,"rank":1604,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1872,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143,"mean":8.9372112676056,"rank":80,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1},"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NWASLibrary\/statuses\/779762144552316928","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12190577],"posted_on":"2016-09-24T19:19:17+00:00","author":{"name":"NWASLibrary","url":"http:\/\/www.networks.nhs.uk\/nhs-networks\/nwas-library-and-information-service","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/602271582116061184\/FuIqklb6_normal.png","description":"North West Ambulance Service NHS Trust, Library & Knowledge Service [NWAS LKS].
