The residence times for molecules inside a well-defined detection volume were extracted and the resulting distribution was compared with quantitative analytical predictions from random-walk theory for the time of first passage. The results suggest that a small number of strongly adsorbing sites strongly influence mass transport at trace analyte levels.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6183cf058f610007400","authors":["Shuo Kang","Klaus Mathwig","Dileep Mampallil","Zinaida Kostiuchenko","S.
