Bone biopsies were retrieved from the center of the necrotic bone and from visually healthy bone, and 16 S rRNA gene fragments from bacterial DNA were amplified with polymerase chain reaction.\nThe study revealed a diversity of bacteria represented by 16 S rRNA sequences in all the necrotic bone samples and in 60% of the visually healthy bone. Eight dominating taxa groups were identified at the genus level: Porphyromonas, Lactobacillus, Tannerella, Prevotella, Actinomyces, Treponema, Streptococcus, and Fusobacterium.\nThe necrotic bone lesions contained mainly anaerobic bacteria, representative of periodontal microflora, suggesting that a periodontal infection in combination with antiresorptive treatment could initiate osteonecrosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f6100083ec","authors":["Fredrik Hallmer","Tore Bj\u00f8rnland","Gunilla Andersson","Jonas P.
