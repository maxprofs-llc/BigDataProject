Nocturia (\u22652 voids per night) and nocturnal urine production were determined using an urination diary and nocturnal urine collection, respectively.\nThe mean age of participants was 71.9\u00b17.1 (standard deviation) years, and the prevalence of nocturia was 30.8%. A 1\u00b0C decrease in daytime indoor temperature was associated with higher odds ratio (OR) for nocturia (1.064, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.016-1.114, p = 0.008), independent of outdoor temperature and other potential confounders such as basic characteristics (age, gender, body mass index, alcohol intake, smoking), comorbidities (diabetes, renal dysfunction), medications (calcium channel blocker, diuretics, sleeping pills), socioeconomic status (education, household income), nighttime dipping of ambulatory blood pressure, daytime physical activity, objectively measured sleep efficiency, and urinary melatonin excretion. The association stayed significant after adjustment for nocturnal urine production rate (OR 1.084, 95% CI 1.032-1.138, p = 0.001).\nIndoor cold exposure during daytime was independently associated with nocturia among elderly participants. The mechanism is explained by cold-induced detrusor over activity. The prevalence of nocturia could be reduced by modification of the indoor thermal environment.
