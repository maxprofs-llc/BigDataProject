This study explored how physicians' regulation of displayed emotions affects patients' satisfaction, under low and high levels of patient distress and length of physician-patient acquaintance.\nQuestionnaires were administered to 46 physicians and 230 of their patients (before and after the medical encounter) in outpatient clinics of two hospitals.\nData were analyzed with hierarchical linear modeling which takes the nested data structure into account. We found a significant interaction effect of physician regulation of displayed emotions and patient distress on satisfaction: When distress was high, physician regulation of emotions was negatively related to patient satisfaction. The results also show a significant interaction effect of physician regulation of displayed emotions and length of physician-patient acquaintance: With a longer acquaintance, physician regulation of emotions was negatively related to patient satisfaction.\nThe effect of the physicians' emotional display on patient satisfaction depends on contextual factors, such as patient distress and length of physician-patient acquaintance, which affect patients' emotional needs and expectations.\nWhen patients have high emotional involvement in the encounter it is suggested that physicians consider presenting genuine emotions to patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032a1","authors":["Dana Yagil","Moran Shnapper-Cohen","Yagil, Dana","Shnapper-Cohen, Moran"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pec.2016.04.003","endpage":"1698","first_seen_on":"2016-05-25T17:25:09+00:00","issns":["1873-5134","07383991"],"issue":"10","journal":"Patient Education & Counseling","last_mentioned_on":1490444109,"links":["http:\/\/www.pec-journal.com\/article\/S0738-3991(16)30155-0\/abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27085519\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27085519","http:\/\/www.pec-journal.com\/article\/S0738-3991(16)30155-0\/fulltext?platform=hootsuite"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pec-journal.com\/article\/S0738399116301550\/pdf","pmid":"27085519","pubdate":"2016-04-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1694","subjects":["nursing"],"title":"When authenticity matters most: Physicians\u2019 regulation of emotional display and patient satisfaction","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0738399116301550","volume":"99","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/authenticity-matters-most-physicians-regulation-emotional-display-patient-satisfaction"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.1,"score_history":{"1y":9.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":783751,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7628550,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":273676,"mean":11.641321662556,"rank":36192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":237355,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":273676,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1840,"mean":5.2702033713975,"rank":164,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":1676,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1840,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":5.5142333333333,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":10,"researcher":2,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":10,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
