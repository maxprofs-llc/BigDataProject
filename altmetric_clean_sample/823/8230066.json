The primary objective was to assess the effectiveness of liraglutide in control of glycemia and body weight in clinical practice (stage 1). The secondary objective was to compare the clinical effectiveness of liraglutide with sitagliptin on glycemic control and body weight in clinical practice in a propensity-score-matched population (stage 2).\nIn stage 1 (n\u00a0=\u00a0402), 39.4% of patients treated with liraglutide achieved \u22651.0% (10.9\u00a0mmol\/mol) reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) after 180\u00a0days of treatment and 54.9% achieved the target HbA1c of <7.0% (53.0\u00a0mmol\/mol). Moreover, compared with baseline, 22.5% of patients treated with liraglutide achieved both \u22651.0% reduction in HbA1c and \u22653.0% reduction in body weight. In stage 2, a significantly greater proportion of patients receiving liraglutide (n\u00a0=\u00a0180) than sitagliptin (n\u00a0=\u00a0208) achieved \u22651.0% reduction in HbA1c [52.9% vs 33.5%, respectively (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0002)]. Mean body-weight loss was also significantly greater in patients receiving liraglutide vs sitagliptin [-3.5 vs -1.3\u00a0kg, respectively (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001)].\nThis study provides real-world evidence from Sweden corroborating previous clinical trials that demonstrate greater efficacy of liraglutide over sitagliptin on glycemic control and body-weight reduction in patients with T2D.\nNovo Nordisk A\/S.\nClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02077946.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007100","authors":["Marcus Lind","Per-Olov Matsson","Ragnar Linder","Irene Svenningsson","Leif J\u00f8rgensen","Uffe J.
