Neural signals are acquired, filtered, digitized and compressed in the channels. Additionally, each channel implements an auto-calibration algorithm which individually configures the transfer characteristics of the recording site. The system has two transmission modes; in one case the information captured by the channels is sent as uncompressed raw data; in the other, feature vectors extracted from the detected neural spikes are released. Data streams coming from the channels are serialized by the embedded digital processor. Experimental results, including in vivo measurements, show that the power consumption of the complete system is lower than 330\u00a0\u03bcW.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f6100076e0","authors":["Manuel Delgado-Restituto","Alberto Rodr\u00edguez-P\u00e9rez","Angela Darie","Cristina Soto-S\u00e1nchez","Eduardo Fern\u00e1ndez-Jover","\u00c1ngel Rodr\u00edguez-V\u00e1zquez"],"doi":"10.1109\/tbcas.2016.2618319","first_seen_on":"2017-02-26T01:04:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-4545","1940-9990"],"journal":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","last_mentioned_on":1488071074,"links":["http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/abstract\/document\/7852508\/?reload=true"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/iel7\/4156126\/4358093\/07852508.pdf","pmid":"28212096","pubdate":"2017-02-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"IEEE","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering","biotechnology"],"title":"System-Level Design of a 64-Channel Low Power Neural Spike Recording Sensor","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/document\/7852508\/","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/systemlevel-design-64channel-low-power-neural-spike-recording-sensor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8276988,"mean":6.9824426364262,"rank":7157711,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8276988,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242478,"mean":13.634396054058,"rank":202043,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242478,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124,"mean":2.8585040650407,"rank":92,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":4,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
