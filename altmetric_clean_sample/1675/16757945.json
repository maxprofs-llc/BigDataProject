All four compounds specifically inhibited the DNA polymerase activity of HIV-1 RT but had no apparent effect on the RNase H activity of this enzyme or on the DNA polymerase or RNase H activity of HIV-2 RT. Three of these compounds showed the generally expected patterns of resistance and susceptibility with the various chimeric RTs. However, the inhibition patterns of the chimeric RTs by calanolide A provided evidence that there is a segment between residues 94 and 157 in HIV-1 RT that is critical for inhibition. However, the data also suggest that there may be a second segment located between amino acids 225 and 427 in HIV-1 RT that is also important for specifying susceptibility to the drug.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a6a","authors":["Hizi, A","Tal, R","Shaharabany, M","Currens, M J","Boyd, M R","Hughes, S H","McMahon, J B"],"first_seen_on":"2017-02-26T01:44:09+00:00","issns":["0066-4804"],"issue":"5","journal":"Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1403827200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7685994"],"pmcid":"PMC187890","pmid":"7685994","pubdate":"1993-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["drugtherapy"],"title":"Specific inhibition of the reverse transcriptase of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and the chimeric enzymes of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and type 2 by nonnucleoside inhibitors.","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/specific-inhibition-reverse-transcriptase-human-immunodeficiency-virus-type-1-chimeric-enzymes-human"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7289480,"mean":6.3680931594666,"rank":1734639,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4605437,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7289480,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89488,"mean":12.557192329612,"rank":29331,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":58417,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89488,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5267,"mean":6.7160208887201,"rank":1858,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2594,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5267,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":131,"mean":11.893307692308,"rank":111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":131,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
