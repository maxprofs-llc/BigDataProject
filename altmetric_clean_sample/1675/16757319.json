PSC is an uncommon and highly heterogeneous disease, associated with inflammatory bowel disease and a complex pathophysiology. To date, no medical therapies have proved effective. The only available treatment for end-stage PSC is liver transplant, but recurrence is a significant complication. Areas covered: This review will explore previously tested treatments, discuss current treatment strategies and present viewpoints about future emerging therapies in PSC. We searched PubMed using the noted keywords. We included data from full-text articles published in English. Further relevant articles were identified from the reference lists of review articles. Expert commentary: The development of new therapies in PSC has been challenging. However, with greater awareness of the disease nowadays, new insights into the disease may help in the design of future therapeutic agents in PSC and ultimately in effective therapies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073d1","authors":["Eduardo A.
