The BV database is an essential tool for laboratory management. Examples of application of data derived from BV are given in this paper, such as analytical performance specifications that have been included in various quality control software designed to optimize operative rules; also they have been incorporated as acceptability limits in external quality assurance reports. BV data from pathological status are of utmost interest for monitoring patients and differences between the intra-individual coefficients of variation (CVI) estimated from healthy and patients are shown. However, for a number of analytes there are limited data available and for many there are no data, consequently new studies should be encouraged at an international level. In addition, developing international criteria to evaluate publications dealing with the estimation of BV components would be of the utmost interest. We are ready and willing to collaborate with such worthy initiatives. The first EFLM strategic conference on analytical performance specifications is an excellent opportunity for debating these ideas.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002551","authors":["Ric\u00f3s, Carmen","\u00c1lvarez, Virtudes","Perich, Carmen","Fern\u00e1ndez-Calle, Pilar","Minchinela, Joana","Cava, Fernando","Biosca, Carmen","Boned, Beatriz","Dom\u00e9nech, Mariv\u00ed","Garc\u00eda-Lario, Jos\u00e9 Vicente","Sim\u00f3n, Margarita","Fern\u00e1ndez, Pilar Fern\u00e1ndez","Diaz-Garz\u00f3n, Jorge","Gonz\u00e1lez-Lao, Elisabet"],"doi":"10.1515\/cclm-2014-1142","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T16:03:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1434-6621"],"issue":"6","journal":"Clinical Chemistry & Laboratory Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1430476297,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25928757?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25928757","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques","chemistryclinical"],"title":"Rationale for using data on biological variation.","type":"article","volume":"53","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rationale-using-data-biological-variation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5044953,"mean":5.9751374954631,"rank":4196186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5044953,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168860,"mean":9.0022546384855,"rank":139171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168860,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1034,"mean":1.0993610842207,"rank":519,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1034,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":4.1780392156863,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":3,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Computer Science":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1},"mendeley":{"BE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/labhuc\/status\/594086766623068160","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4021906],"posted_on":"2015-05-01T10:31:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Lab Central HUC","url":"http:\/\/www.laboratoriocentral.es","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2294146713\/yko65x8amimlhldy5b0t_normal.jpeg","description":"Laboratorio Central del Hospital Universitario de Canarias","id_on_source":"labhuc","tweeter_id":"22674542","geo":{"lt":28.4853,"ln":-16.32014,"country":"ES"},"followers":285},"tweet_id":"594086766623068160"}]}}
