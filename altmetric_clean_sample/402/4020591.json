In this research, we tried to assess the anti-inflammatory effects of SH on LPS-induced bovine endometrial epithelial cell (bEEC) inflammation. SH cell toxicity was measured using the MTT and LDH assays, and inflammatory cytokine expression was assessed by ELISA, qRT-PCR and Western blotting. We demonstrated that SH was not cytotoxic to bEECs, and that it significantly decreased the LPS-induced mRNA and protein expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) \u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-8. Furthermore, in LPS-induced bEECs, SH inhibited I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation and NF-\u03baB p65 phosphorylation, and suppressed the phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). In conclusion, we found that SH could effectively block the NF-\u03baB-mediated signaling pathway and reduce the inflammatory process, thereby exerting a protective effect on bEECs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f61000346b","authors":["Zhu, Qi","Xu, Xiaolong","Liu, Xiaoxi","Lin, Jiabao","Kan, Yao","Zhong, Yougang","Liu, Fenghua","Xu, Jianqin"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.rvsc.2015.04.004","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T15:23:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-2661"],"journal":"Research in Veterinary Science","last_mentioned_on":1430838881,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25935757?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25935757","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Sodium houttuyfonate inhibits inflammation by blocking the MAPKs\/NF-\u03baB signaling pathways in bovine endometrial epithelial cells.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sodium-houttuyfonate-inhibits-inflammation-blocking-mapksnf%CE%BAb-signaling-pathways-bovine-endometrial"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5059951,"mean":5.99355929209,"rank":3552483,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":850072,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5059951,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169041,"mean":9.020816564127,"rank":120901,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":29625,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169041,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":593,"mean":1.2538209459459,"rank":249,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":266,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":593,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.55833333333333,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/libroazuln\/status\/595598602652688384","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4020591],"posted_on":"2015-05-05T14:39:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Libro Azul","url":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Libro-Azul\/279667772085894?sk=app_190322544333196","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1733482297\/Bright_512x512_normal.png","description":"La desnutrici\u00f3n es un factor que se asocia con mal pron\u00f3stico en pacientes hospitalizados y ambulatorios","id_on_source":"libroazuln","tweeter_id":"454601506","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":161},"tweet_id":"595598602652688384"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Immunol_papers\/status\/595607553490362368","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4020591],"posted_on":"2015-05-05T15:14:41+00:00","author":{"name":"ImmunologyPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507527250015576065\/AHPc4B-C_normal.png","description":"A TwitterBot for #Immunology papers on #PubMed searching for adaptive, innate and cyto\/chemokine.
