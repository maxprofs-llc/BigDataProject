The final sequalae of cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma are often the result of inflammation driven by intrahepatic lymphocytes. Accurate assessment of organ-specific diseases ideally employs tissue sampling though this is rarely performed. Here we report our experiences of utilising repeated fine needle aspirations (FNAs) to assess liver-derived leukocytes. In 88 patient samples, we obtained a mean of 36,959 lymphocytes from each FNA-derived biopsy (SD 22,319 cells, range 5034-91,242 cells) measured by flow cytometry. This quick technique required minimal analgesia compared to liver biopsy (p=0.03); was well tolerated and safe, and hence repeated sampling up to 3 times within a week was feasible. We detail the technique to rapidly derive a single cell suspension suitable for multiparameter flow cytometry analysis. Finally we illustrate the importance of organ-derived sampling by showing that natural killer (NK) cells from FNA samples have a markedly altered phenotype compared to those assessed in peripheral blood. In combination these data validate FNA as a powerful and well-tolerated method of sampling intrahepatic lymphocytes to study the immunology of acute and chronic liver diseases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002df0","authors":["Pembroke, Tom","Gallimore, Awen","Godkin, Andrew"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jim.2015.04.011","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T16:44:09+00:00","funders":["niehs","wellcome"],"issns":["1872-7905"],"journal":"Journal of Immunological Methods","last_mentioned_on":1430301876,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25914090?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25914090","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Tracking the kinetics of intrahepatic immune responses by repeated fine needle aspiration of the liver.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tracking-kinetics-intrahepatic-immune-responses-repeated-fine-needle-aspiration-liver"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038209,"mean":5.9746183047646,"rank":4191285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038209,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168718,"mean":9.0067654356113,"rank":139044,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168718,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":466,"mean":2.0326494623656,"rank":355,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":466,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.7916666666667,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
