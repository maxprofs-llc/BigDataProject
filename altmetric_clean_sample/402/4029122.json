Results showed that removal efficiencies of TN and EDPs were improved with addition of 3.6kg P. communis\/m(3) in the biofilm system. Meanwhile, the uniform distribution of P. communis favored simultaneously nitrogen and organics removal but not to trace EDPs compared with non-uniform distribution of P. communis. The biofilm on elastic filler was mainly responsible for the nitrification with NH4(+)-N oxidation efficiency of 82.9\u00b11.5%. Poor nitrification with NH4(+)-N oxidation efficiency of 36.3\u00b16.1% but effective denitrification with a TN removal efficiency of 56.5\u00b12.0% were obtained by the biofilm on P. communis. Cypermethrin was mainly removed via adsorption and microbial degradation, and chlorpyrifos removal mostly depended on the microbial degradation in biofilm system.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f5","authors":["Feng, Lijuan","Yang, Guangfeng","Zhu, Liang","Xu, Xiangyang","Gao, Feng","Mu, Jun","Xu, Yanmei"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.biortech.2015.03.095","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T19:59:56+00:00","issns":["1873-2976"],"journal":"Bioresource Technology","last_mentioned_on":1428833706,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25863211?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25863211","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Enhancement removal of endocrine-disrupting pesticides and nitrogen removal in a biofilm reactor coupling of biodegradable Phragmites communis and elastic filler for polluted source water treatment.","type":"article","volume":"187","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/enhancement-removal-endocrinedisrupting-pesticides-nitrogen-removal-biofilm-reactor-coupling-biodegr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4986430,"mean":5.8992042329313,"rank":4168960,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4986430,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168250,"mean":8.9627619896702,"rank":139271,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168250,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1299,"mean":1.9383605546995,"rank":852,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1299,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":4.3462962962963,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
