A test that can reliably identify individuals that suffer from EDS is needed. In contrast to other methods, salivary biomarkers are an objective, inexpensive, and noninvasive method to identify individuals with inadequate sleep. Although we have previously shown that inflammatory genes are elevated in saliva samples taken from sleep deprived individuals, it is unclear if inflammatory genes will be elevated in clinical populations with EDS. In this study, salivary samples from individuals with sleep apnea were evaluated using the Taqman low density inflammation array. Transcript levels for 3 genes, including prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), were elevated in patients with sleep apnea. Interestingly, PTGS2 was also elevated in patients with EDS but who did not have sleep apnea. These data demonstrate the feasibility of using salivary transcript levels to identify individuals that self-report excessive daytime sleepiness.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5023cf058f61000308f","authors":["Thimgan, Matthew S","Toedebusch, Cristina","McLeland, Jennifer","Duntley, Stephen P","Shaw, Paul J"],"doi":"10.1155\/2015\/539627","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T19:06:08+00:00","funders":["nhlbi"],"issns":["1466-1861","0962-9351"],"journal":"Mediators of Inflammation","last_mentioned_on":1460768342,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25873764?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25873764?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25873764","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pathology","biochemistry"],"title":"Excessive daytime sleepiness is associated with changes in salivary inflammatory genes transcripts.","type":"article","volume":"2015","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/excessive-daytime-sleepiness-associated-changes-salivary-inflammatory-genes-transcripts"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7556298,"mean":6.524637537139,"rank":3057200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4451444,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7556298,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":215348,"mean":8.4348088712637,"rank":80436,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":132295,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":215348,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":958,"mean":2.0545768025078,"rank":180,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":770,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":958,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":3.7924186046512,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
