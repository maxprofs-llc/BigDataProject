The functional miRNAs regulating tumor growth and progression in insulinomas are still unknown. We conducted the miRNA expression profile analysis using miRNA qRT-PCR array and identified 114 differentially expressed miRNAs in human insulinomas compared to normal pancreatic islets. Forty-one differentially expressed miRNAs belonged to 7miRNA families, and 28 miRNAs in 3 of the families localized in the epigenetically regulated imprinted chromosome 14q32 region. We validated the most significant differentially expressed miRNA cluster miR-144\/451 in another 8 human normal islet samples and 25 insulinomas. Our data showed the overexpression of miR-144\/451 in mouse pancreatic \u03b2-cells promoted cell proliferation by targeting the \u03b2-cell regulator PTEN\/AKT pathway and p19. Our findings highlight the importance of functional miRNAs in insulinomas.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6163cf058f610007282","authors":["Jiang, Xiuli","Shan, Aijing","Su, Yutong","Cheng, Yulong","Gu, Weiqiong","Wang, Weiqing","Ning, Guang","Cao, Yanan"],"doi":"10.1210\/en.2014-1966","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T16:35:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1945-7170"],"journal":"Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1430311455,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25919186?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25919186","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"MiR-144\/451 Promote Cell Proliferation via Targeting PTEN\/AKT Pathway in Insulinomas.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mir144451-promote-cell-proliferation-via-targeting-ptenakt-pathway-insulinomas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038209,"mean":5.9746183047646,"rank":4191285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038209,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168718,"mean":9.0067704736335,"rank":139044,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168718,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2264,"mean":3.6090366769775,"rank":1857,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2264,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":5.11752,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
