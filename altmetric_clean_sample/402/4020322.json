Despite the fact that MCPvV is detected more broadly within the population, only a part of the infected people also develop MCC. It is thus conceivable that together, virus and for example mutations, are necessary for disease development. However, apart from a correlation between MCPyV positivity or mutations and MCC development, less is known about the association of these factors with progressive disease.\nTo analyze MCPyV positivity, load and integration in MCC as well as presence of mutations in PDGFR\u03b1 and TP53 genes and correlate these with clinical features and disease progression to identify features with prognostic value for clinical progression.\nThis is a study on a MCC population group of 64 patients. MCPyV positivity, load and integration in parallel to mutations in the PDGFR\u03b1 and TP53 were analyzed on genomic DNA from MCC specimens. In addition, expression of PDGFR\u03b1, survivin and p53 proteins was analyzed by immunodetection in tissues specimens. All these parameters were analyzed as function of patient's disease progression status.\n83% of MCCs were positive for the MCPyV and among these 36% also displayed virus-T integration. Viral load ranged from 0.006 to 943 viral DNA copies\/\u03b2-globin gene and was highest in patients with progressive disease. We detected more than one mutation within the PDGFR\u03b1 gene and identified two new SNPs in 36% of MCC patients, whereas no mutations were found in TP53 gene. Survivin was expressed in 78% of specimens. We could not correlate either mutations in PDGFR or expression of PDGFR, p53 and surviving either to the disease progression or to the MCPyV positivity.\nIn conclusion, our data indicate that the viral positivity when associated with high viral load, correlates with poor disease outcome. Frequent mutations in the PDGFR\u03b1 gene and high survivin expression were found in MCC independent of the viral positivity. These data suggest that these three factors independently contribute to Merkel cell carcinoma development and that only the viral load can be used as indicator of disease progression in virus positive patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d4f","authors":["Batinica, M","Akg\u00fcl, B","Silling, S","Mauch, C","Zigrino, P"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jdermsci.2015.04.002","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T15:14:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-569X"],"journal":"Journal of Dermatological Science","last_mentioned_on":1456919794,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25936870?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25936870","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Correlation of Merkel cell polyomavirus positivity with PDGFR\u03b1 mutations and survivin expression in Merkel cell carcinoma.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/correlation-merkel-cell-polyomavirus-positivity-pdgfr-mutations-survivin-expression-merkel-cell-carc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7342039,"mean":6.3783632029643,"rank":3761514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2059739,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7342039,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":213269,"mean":8.4051223718515,"rank":115930,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":76156,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":213269,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":399,"mean":3.1321708542714,"rank":165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":169,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":399,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.945,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Neuroscience":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dermatologyf\/status\/595897818188886016","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4020322],"posted_on":"2015-05-06T10:28:05+00:00","author":{"name":"dermatologyf","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2046835740\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Dermatology News","id_on_source":"dermatologyf","tweeter_id":"546505902","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":58},"tweet_id":"595897818188886016"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/dermatologyf\/statuses\/704998830853390337","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4020322],"posted_on":"2016-03-02T11:56:34+00:00","author":{"name":"dermatologyf","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2046835740\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Dermatology News","id_on_source":"dermatologyf","tweeter_id":"546505902","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":58},"tweet_id":"704998830853390337"}]}}
