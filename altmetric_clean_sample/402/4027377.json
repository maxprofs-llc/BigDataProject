However, promising results are mainly derived from SBRT of peripheral pulmonary lesions, whereas SBRT for central tumours can lead to severe radiation sequelae due to the spatial proximity to serial organs at risk. Robust data on the tolerance of mediastinal structures to high dose hypofractionated radiation is limited, further there are many open questions regarding efficiency, safety and response assessment of SBRT in inoperable, centrally located early stage NSCLC, which are addressed in a prospective multi-centre study (EORTC 22113-08113 - LungTech). In this review we summarize the current status regarding SBRT for centrally located early stage NSCLC that leads to the rationale of the LungTech trial. Outline and some essential features of the study with focus on a summary of current experiences in dose\/ fraction - toxicity coherences after SBRT to the mediastinal structures that lead to LungTech normal tissue constraints are provided.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002453","authors":["Adebahr, Sonja","Collette, Sandra","Shash, Emad","Lambrecht, Marie","Le Pechoux, C\u00e9cile","Faivre-Finn, Corinne","De Ruysscher, Dirk","Peulen, Heike","Belderbos, Jos\u00e9","Dziadziuszko, Rafal","Fink, Christian","Guckenberger, Matthias","Hurkmans, Coen","Nestle, Ursula","S Adebahr","S Collette","E Shash","M Lambrecht","C Le Pechoux","C Faivre-Finn","D De Ruysscher","H Peulen","J Belderbos","R Dziadziuszko","C Fink","M Guckenberger","C Hurkmans","U Nestle"],"doi":"10.1259\/bjr.20150036","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T19:07:41+00:00","issns":["1748-880X","0007-1285"],"issue":"1051","journal":"British Journal of Radiology","last_mentioned_on":1429192966,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25873481?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25873481","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"20150036","subjects":["radiology"],"title":"LungTech, an EORTC phase II trial of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for centrally located lung tumours - a clinical perspective.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.birpublications.org\/doi\/10.1259\/bjr.20150036","volume":"88","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lungtech-eortc-phase-ii-trial-stereotactic-body-radiotherapy-centrally-located-lung-tumours-clinical"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7419766,"mean":6.4517840672812,"rank":5614130,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":995874,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7419766,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":213872,"mean":8.4323033136799,"rank":150747,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":33079,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":213872,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":777,"mean":2.4878737113402,"rank":547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":144,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":777,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":2.1491111111111,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
