Similar mutations\/deletions can give rise to variable phenotypes ranging from mild adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) to inflammatory fatal cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) via unknown mechanisms. We recently reported the loss of the anti-inflammatory protein adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK\u03b11) exclusively in ALD patient-derived cells. X-ALD mouse model (Abcd1-knockout (KO) mice) mimics the human AMN phenotype and does not develop the cerebral inflammation characteristic of human ALD. In this study we document that AMPK\u03b11 levels in vivo (in brain cortex and spinal cord) and in vitro in Abcd1-KO mixed glial cells are similar to that of wild type mice. Deletion of AMPK\u03b11 in the mixed glial cells of Abcd1-KO mice induced spontaneous mitochondrial dysfunction (lower oxygen consumption rate and ATP levels). Mitochondrial dysfunction in ALD patient-derived cells and in AMPK\u03b11-deleted Abcd1-KO mice mixed glial cells was accompanied by lower levels of mitochondrial complex (1-V) subunits. More importantly, AMPK\u03b11 deletion induced proinflammatory inducible nitric oxide synthase levels in the unstimulated Abcd1-KO mice mixed glial cells. Taken together, this study provides novel direct evidence for a causal role for AMPK loss in the development of mitochondrial dysfunction and proinflammatory response in X-ALD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5023cf058f61000308f","authors":["Singh, Jaspreet","Suhail, Hamid","Giri, Shailendra"],"doi":"10.1155\/2015\/176983","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T20:10:12+00:00","issns":["1466-1861","0962-9351"],"journal":"Mediators of Inflammation","last_mentioned_on":1460768335,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25861159?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25861159","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pathology","biochemistry"],"title":"Loss of AMP-Activated Protein Kinase Induces Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Proinflammatory Response in Unstimulated Abcd1-Knockout Mice Mixed Glial Cells.","type":"article","volume":"2015","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/loss-ampactivated-protein-kinase-induces-mitochondrial-dysfunction-proinflammatory-response-unstimul"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7556298,"mean":6.524637537139,"rank":3685572,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3679206,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7556298,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":215348,"mean":8.4348088712637,"rank":107350,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":99005,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":215348,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":958,"mean":2.0545768025078,"rank":279,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":611,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":958,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":3.7924186046512,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
