Overall, 3 groups of patients were studied according to the dosing schedule they received: schedule 4\/2 (n = 50), transitional schedule 2\/1 (T2\/1; patients switched from schedule 4\/2 to 2\/1; n = 26), and initial schedule 2\/1 (I2\/1; n = 32). The tumor response, progression-free survival (PFS) time, adverse events, and HRQoL were assessed and compared among the groups.\nThe incidences of diarrhea, fatigue, hand-foot syndrome, and neutropenia induced by the treatment of sunitinib were all significantly less common with schedule I2\/1 and T2\/1 than with schedule 4\/2 (P<0.05). Although there was no statistically significant difference in the tumor response among the 3 groups, the median PFS time was significantly longer with schedule I2\/1 than with schedules T2\/1 and 4\/2 (11.2 vs. 9.4 and 9.5mo, respectively, P = 0.030), and HRQoL (as determined by 19-item Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Kidney Symptom Index scores) was better.\nTreatment with sunitinib 50mg daily using a 2\/1 dosing schedule can provide better tolerability and a longer PFS with better HRQoL in Chinese patients with mRCC than the traditional schedule 4\/2.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036e2","authors":["Pan, Xiuwu","Huang, Hai","Huang, Yi","Liu, Bing","Cui, Xingang","Gan, Sishun","Ye, Jianqing","Xu, Danfeng","Chen, Lu","Zhou, Qiwei","Li, Lin","Hong, Yi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.urolonc.2015.03.008","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T19:45:55+00:00","issns":["1873-2496"],"journal":"Urologic Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1428959157,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25863944?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25863944","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Sunitinib dosing schedule 2\/1 improves tolerability, efficacy, and health-related quality of life in Chinese patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sunitinib-dosing-schedule-21-improves-tolerability-efficacy-healthrelated-quality-life-chinese-patie"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6405734,"mean":5.8610928910102,"rank":2765462,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":3585886,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6405734,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":181290,"mean":9.0582013139243,"rank":92608,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":86884,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":181290,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":422,"mean":3.3156009501188,"rank":170,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":244,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":422,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.8678571428571,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mlazqui\/status\/587695600499589120","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4028631],"posted_on":"2015-04-13T19:15:24+00:00","author":{"name":"Mart\u00edn L\u00e1zaro","url":"http:\/\/www.novedadesenoncologia.blogspot.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000653691864\/11d6fb0c77217bfce2c907aa9b0f2ee5_normal.jpeg","description":"Medical oncologist.
