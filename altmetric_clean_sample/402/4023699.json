Diet recalls, detailed interviews, fasting blood, and anthropometric measures were collected at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months.\nHispanic women (n=70) with stage 0 to III breast cancer who completed adjuvant treatment and lived in New York City were randomized between April 2011 and March\u00a02012.\nThe Intervention group (n=34) participated in \u00a1Cocinar Para Su Salud!, a culturally based nine-session (24 hours over 12 weeks) intervention including nutrition education, cooking classes, and food-shopping field trips. The Control group (n=36) received written dietary recommendations for breast cancer survivors.\nChange at 6 months in daily F\/V servings and percent calories from total fat were the main outcome measures.\nLinear regression models adjusted for stratification factors and estimated marginal means were used to compare changes in diet from baseline to 3 and 6 months.\nBaseline characteristics were the following: mean age 56.6 years (standard deviation 9.7 years), mean time since diagnosis 3.4 years (standard deviation 2.7 years), mean body mass index (calculated as kg\/m(2)) 30.9 (standard deviation 6.0), 62.9% with annual household income \u2264$15,000, mean daily servings of all F\/V was 5.3 (targeted F\/V 3.7 servings excluding legumes\/juices\/starchy vegetables\/fried foods), and 27.7% of daily calories from fat. More than 60% in the Intervention group attended seven or more of nine classes, with overall study retention of 87% retention at 6 months. At month 6, the Intervention group compared with Control group reported an increase in mean servings of F\/V from baseline (all F\/V:\u00a0+2.0 vs\u00a0-0.1; P=0.005; targeted F\/V:\u00a0+2.7 vs\u00a0+0.5; P=0.002) and a nonsignificant decrease in percent calories from fat (-7.5% vs\u00a0-4.4%; P=0.23) and weight (-2.5 kg vs\u00a0+3.8 kg; P=0.22).\n\u00a1Cocinar Para Su Salud! was effective at increasing short-term F\/V intake in a diverse population of Hispanic breast cancer survivors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e8b","authors":["Greenlee, Heather","Gaffney, Ann Ogden","Aycinena, A Corina","Koch, Pam","Contento, Isobel","Karmally, Wahida","Richardson, John M","Lim, Emerson","Tsai, Wei-Yann","Crew, Katherine","Maurer, Matthew","Kalinsky, Kevin","Hershman, Dawn L"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jand.2015.02.027","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T16:59:48+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["2212-2672"],"issue":"5 Suppl","journal":"Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics","last_mentioned_on":1430043728,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25911520?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25911520","subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"\u00a1Cocinar Para Su Salud!: Randomized Controlled Trial of a Culturally Based Dietary Intervention among Hispanic Breast Cancer Survivors.","type":"article","volume":"115","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inverted-exclamation-markcocinar-para-su-salud-randomized-controlled-trial-culturally-based-dietary"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039712,"mean":5.9641504891867,"rank":2676089,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1688809,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039712,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169908,"mean":8.978628814587,"rank":97469,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":54082,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169908,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":631,"mean":15.275177777778,"rank":436,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":143,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":631,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":13.239619047619,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cgrisan\/status\/592272441944051713","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4023699],"posted_on":"2015-04-26T10:22:08+00:00","author":{"name":"cgrisan","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"cgrisan","tweeter_id":"2832037486","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":5},"tweet_id":"592272441944051713"}]}}
