In most cases, the elderly have cardiac ischemia or chronic coronary diseases, which would lead to more ischemic events during general anesthesia. Therefore, surgeons and anesthetists prefer regional aesthesia to the general one owing to its more advantages and less complications.\nTherefore, this study aimed to compare topical method and retrobulbar block for pain intensity, patient's satisfaction, hemodynamic changes and intra and postoperative complications.\nIn a single-blinded clinical trial, 114 patients scheduled for cataract surgery, aged 50 to 90 years with ASA physical status of I-III, were randomly assigned to two groups under monitored anesthesia care as topical anesthesia and retrobulbar block. After the injection of intravenous sedation, which was the combination of midazolam 0.5-1 mg with fentanyl 0.5-1 \u00b5\/kg, patients received retro bulbar block or topical anesthesia. During the operation, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial blood pressure and arterial saturation of O2were measured every five minutes. In addition, pain (VAS) and satisfaction (ISAS) scores were recorded every 15 minutes, then at recovery and one hour after the ending of operation in the ward. Findings were statistically analyzed using SPSS 16.\nIn this study, no significant association was found between age, gender, education and physical condition of patients in both topical and retro bulbar block groups. Comparison of pain based on VAS, satisfaction based on ISAS score and MAP in the studied periods had no significant differences between the two groups of patients undergoing cataract surgery. However, significant differences were found between the two groups (P = 0.045, 0.02, 0.042 and P < 0.05) regarding heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and arterial oxygen saturation percentage after 20-30 minutes of the operation.\nBoth methods, topical and retro bulbar block had similar impression in cataract surgery regarding analgesia and patient satisfaction. However, in non-complicated cataract surgeries with short duration, topical anesthesia may be the preferable method, because of non-invasiveness, appropriate analgesia, patient satisfaction and hemodynamic stability.","altmetric_jid":"583e01a87ac79e9838077897","authors":["Haddadi, Soudabeh","Marzban, Shideh","Fazeli, Baharak","Heidarzadeh, Abtin","Parvizi, Arman","Naderinabi, Bahram","Panjtan Panah, Mohamad Reza"],"doi":"10.5812\/aapm.24780","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T16:43:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2228-7523"],"issue":"2","journal":"Anesthesiology And Pain Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1430301909,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25918686?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25918686","pubdate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Comparing the effect of topical anesthesia and retrobulbar block with intravenous sedation on hemodynamic changes and satisfaction in patients undergoing cataract surgery (phaco method).","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparing-effect-topical-anesthesia-retrobulbar-block-intravenous-sedation-hemodynamic-changes-satis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6637547,"mean":6.149720809766,"rank":5663530,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6637547,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185817,"mean":9.1104978258064,"rank":153715,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185817,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":4,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Mathematics":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/status\/593355329171140608","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4023253],"posted_on":"2015-04-29T10:05:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
