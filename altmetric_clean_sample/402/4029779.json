Patients underwent local excision and ipsilateral parotidectomy. The primary cancer was analyzed for vascular involvement, perineural invasion, and cartilage involvement, while the parotid specimen was analyzed for cancer positivity.\nThirty-nine parotid (37.5%) samples were positive for carcinoma. Of these, 16 patients had primary auricular carcinomas with vascular involvement, 17 had perineural invasion, and 4 had cartilage involvement. Thirty-two of 77 affected men and 7 of 27 affected women had positive parotid specimen. Vascular involvement (P = .0006) and perineural invasion (P = .0027) of the primary lesion were significantly higher in patients with a positive parotid specimen. Cartilage involvement and sex were not statistically significant.\nElective parotidectomy is beneficial in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the auricle at least 2 cm in size, especially in lesions having perineural invasion and vascular involvement. For patients with positive parotid specimens, we recommend postoperative external beam radiation therapy and close surveillance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005c01","authors":["Kadakia, Sameep","Saman, Masoud","Gordin, Eli","Marra, Diego","Ducic, Yadranko","Sameep Kadakia","Masoud Saman","Eli Gordin","Diego Marra","Yadranko Ducic"],"doi":"10.1177\/0194599815579885","endpage":"1052","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T20:18:50+00:00","issns":["1097-6817"],"issue":"6","journal":"Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1439657342,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25855416?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/oto.sagepub.com\/content\/152\/6\/1048.abstract?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/oto.sagepub.com\/content\/152\/6\/1048.full.pdf","pmid":"25855416","pubdate":"2015-04-08T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1048","subjects":["otolaryngology","generalsurgery"],"title":"The Role of Parotidectomy in the Treatment of Auricular Squamous Cell Carcinoma","type":"article","volume":"152","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-parotidectomy-treatment-auricular-squamous-cell-carcinoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5483994,"mean":6.3682819390887,"rank":2276406,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3119169,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5483994,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179133,"mean":9.0277603219973,"rank":74649,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":100905,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179133,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1592,"mean":3.6125543683218,"rank":557,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":915,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1592,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82,"mean":2.4907407407407,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
