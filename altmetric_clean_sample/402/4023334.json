Current legislation demands the labeling of food products if they contain <1% GMO, as assessed for each ingredient of the product. To create confidence in the testing methods and to complement enforcement requirements, there is an urgent need for internationally validated methods, which could serve as reference methods. To date, several methods have been submitted to validation trials at an international level; approaches now exist that can be used in different circumstances and for different food matrixes. Moreover, the requirement for the formal validation of methods is clearly accepted; several national and international bodies are active in organizing studies. Further validation studies, especially on the quantitative polymerase chain reaction methods, need to be performed to cover the rising demand for new extraction methods and other background matrixes, as well as for novel GMO constructs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c8b","authors":["Ankilam, Elke","Heinze, Petra","Kay, Simon","Van den Eede, Guy","Popping, Bert"],"first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T16:47:12+00:00","issns":["1060-3271"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of AOAC International","last_mentioned_on":1430263703,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12083280"],"pmid":"12083280","pubdate":"2002-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Validation studies and proficiency testing.","type":"article","volume":"85","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/validation-studies-proficiency-testing-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5032982,"mean":5.9702113860563,"rank":2656553,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1719340,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5032982,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168616,"mean":9.0041177593929,"rank":95690,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":56336,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168616,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189,"mean":3.0103085106383,"rank":88,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":84,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":2.1975,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Earth and Planetary Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"CN":1,"IT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MercilessComplx\/status\/593195081219317762","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4023334],"posted_on":"2015-04-28T23:28:23+00:00","author":{"name":"Merciless Complex","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/422582624473731073\/OyskKATn_normal.jpeg","description":"Writing, Music, Creating, Inspiring, Exploring","id_on_source":"MercilessComplx","tweeter_id":"2289074322","followers":187},"tweet_id":"593195081219317762"}]}}
