In an attempt to reduce costs, we developed a homemade specimen retrieval bag for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\nWe used the polyethylene bag containing the catheter of a Redon drainage set. The bag was cut in half and pleated longitudinally; then, the gallbladder was placed in the bag and removed through the umbilicus with a grasping forceps.\nFrom September 2011 to June 2012, we used our homemade bag on 85 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. No rupture, accidental opening, or bile leak was observed. The learning curve was found to be five cases. Our homemade specimen retrieval bag seems to be a safe, effective, and easy tool for tissue extraction. Further studies need to be conducted to evaluate its full potential.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006b5a","authors":["Stavrou, George","Fotiadis, Kyriakos","Panagiotou, Dimitrios","Faitatzidou, Afroditi","Kotzampassi, Katerina"],"doi":"10.1111\/ases.12165","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T16:40:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1758-5910"],"issue":"2","journal":"Asian Journal of Endoscopic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1453287644,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25913593?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25913593","subjects":["generalsurgery","diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Homemade specimen retrieval bag for laparoscopic cholecystectomy: A solution in the time of fiscal crisis.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/homemade-specimen-retrieval-bag-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy-solution-time-fiscal-crisis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6997887,"mean":6.2543742573087,"rank":6007483,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6997887,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":211841,"mean":8.3650553908611,"rank":178039,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":211841,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132,"mean":0.55267175572519,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1.25,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/status\/593358851413442560","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4023141],"posted_on":"2015-04-29T10:19:08+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":371},"tweet_id":"593358851413442560"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/statuses\/689764490708058112","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4023141],"posted_on":"2016-01-20T11:00:44+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":371},"tweet_id":"689764490708058112"}]}}
