However, most individuals with inherited RCC do not have a detectable germline mutation. To identify novel inherited RCC genes we undertook exome resequencing studies in a familial RCC kindred and identified a CDKN2B nonsense mutation that segregated with familial RCC status. Targeted resequencing of CDKN2B in individuals (n=82) with features of inherited RCC then revealed three candidate CDKN2B missense mutations (p.Pro40Thr, (p.Ala23Glu, p.Asp86Asn). In silico analysis of the three-dimensional structures indicated that each missense substitution was likely pathogenic through reduced stability of the mutant or reduced affinity for CDK4 and CDK6 and in vitro studies demonstrated that each of the mutations impaired CDKN2B-induced suppression of proliferation in a RCC cell line. These findings identify germline CDKN2B mutations as a novel cause of familial RCC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dcb","authors":["Jafri, Mariam","Wake, Naomi C","Ascher, David B","Pires, Douglas E V","Gentle, Dean","Morris, Mark R","Rattenberry, Eleanor","Simpson, Michael A","Trembath, Richard C","Weber, Astrid","Woodward, Emma R","Donaldson, Alan","Blundell, Tom L","Latif, Farida","Maher, Eamonn R","Mariam Jafri","Naomi C.
