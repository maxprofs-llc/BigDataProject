Effective treatments, including pathogenesis\u2011based biological agents against psoriasis, are currently under development. Although the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the pathogenesis of psoriasis has been investigated, it remains to be fully elucidated; ROS\u2011targeted therapeutic strategies are also lacking at present. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to assess whether H2, a ROS scavenger, has a therapeutic effect on psoriasis\u2011associated inflammation by reducing hydroxyl radicals or peroxynitrite in the immunogenic psoriasis cascade. Three methods were used to administer H2: Drop infusion of saline containing 1\u00a0ppm H2 (H2\u2011saline), inhalation of 3% H2 gas, and drinking of water containing a high concentration (5\u20117\u2011ppm) of H2 (high\u2011H2 water). Treatment efficacy was estimated using the disease activity score\u00a028 (DAS28) system, based on C\u2011reactive protein levels, and the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score, determined at baseline and following each H2 treatment. Furthermore, levels of TNF\u03b1, IL\u20116, and IL\u201117 were analyzed. The DAS28 and PASI score of the three patients decreased during H2 treatment, regardless of the administration method. The psoriatic skin lesions almost disappeared at the end of the treatment. IL\u20116 levels decreased during H2 treatment in Case\u00a01 and 2. IL\u201117, whose concentration was high in Case\u00a01, was reduced following H2 treatment, and TNF\u03b1 also decreased in Case 1. In conclusion, H2 administration reduced inflammation associated with psoriasis in the three cases examined and it may therefore be considered as a treatment strategy for psoriasis\u2011associated skin lesions and arthritis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c8","authors":["Ishibashi, Toru","Ichikawa, Miki","Sato, Bunpei","Shibata, Shinji","Hara, Yuichi","Naritomi, Yuji","Okazaki, Ken","Nakashima, Yasuharu","Iwamoto, Yukihide","Koyanagi, Samon","Hara, Hiroshi","Nagao, Tetsuhiko","Ishibashi,Toru ","Ichikawa,Miki ","Sato,Bunpei ","Shibata,Shinji ","Hara,Yuichi ","Naritomi,Yuji ","Okazaki,Ken ","Nakashima,Yasuharu ","Iwamoto,Yukihide ","Koyanagi,Samon ","Hara,Hiroshi ","Nagao,Tetsuhiko "],"doi":"10.3892\/mmr.2015.3707","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T15:11:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1791-3004","1791-2997"],"journal":"Molecular Medicine Reports","last_mentioned_on":1494175386,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25936373?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25936373","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3892\/mmr.2015.3707","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25936373?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25936373","pubdate":"2015-04-30T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Improvement of psoriasis-associated arthritis and skin lesions by treatment with molecular hydrogen: A report of three cases.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/improvement-psoriasisassociated-arthritis-skin-lesions-treatment-molecular-hydrogen-report-three-cas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.35,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8201012,"mean":6.9362810438797,"rank":1979236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6201326,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8201012,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":218989,"mean":8.6753996018048,"rank":64086,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":154020,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":218989,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2100,"mean":1.6032072415436,"rank":114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":1986,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2100,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145,"mean":0.90381944444444,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":138,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Improvement of psoriasis-associated arthritis and skin lesions by treatment with molecular...","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=663544603777143&id=640507369414200","license":"public","citation_ids":[4020246],"posted_on":"2015-06-14T09:17:57+00:00","summary":"An interesting abstract from pubmed regarding H2 and its therapeutic effects on Psoriasis associated arthritis.
