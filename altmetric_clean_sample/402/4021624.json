Under untreated conditions caffeine mainly showed inhibitory action on the ureter, inhibiting the evoked action potentials and phasic contractions as well as potassium contracture. Caffeine was also found to suppress the low-Na contracture of Na-loaded ureter muscle. It is established that Na-loaded tissue is able to generate transient contracture in response to caffeine application at 37 degrees C. These caffeine contractures could be evoked under completely removed [Ca2+]0 and in the presence of high doses of Ca-channel blockers (nifedipine, diltiazem, Mn ions) and could be reversibly blocked by tetracaine, procaine and benzocaine. Caffeine contractures could also be produced by the ureter muscle placed in isotonic K-solution. Cooling significantly potentiated low-Na, potassium and caffeine contractures of the ureter muscle. Filling of the store is totally dependent on the entry of Ca ions from the extracellular Ca2+ store sites which sequester Ca ions entering the cell on either Na-Ca exchange or via voltage operated Ca channels.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9373cf058f61000decb","authors":["Burdyga, T V","Magura, I S"],"first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T15:54:29+00:00","issns":["0231-5882"],"issue":"6","journal":"General physiology and biophysics","last_mentioned_on":1430499060,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2435612"],"pmid":"2435612","pubdate":"1986-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","physiology"],"title":"Effects of caffeine on the electrical and mechanical activity of guinea-pig ureter smooth muscle.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-caffeine-electrical-mechanical-activity-guineapig-ureter-smooth-muscle"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5045006,"mean":5.9752110334897,"rank":2662954,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1723586,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5045006,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168859,"mean":9.0023097277004,"rank":95848,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":56403,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168859,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":1.4971343283582,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.8,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hellraider999\/status\/594182240420003841","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4021624],"posted_on":"2015-05-01T16:51:00+00:00","author":{"name":"Diya Roy","url":"http:\/\/facebook.com\/dgroy81","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/658842468012560384\/uc6TNPMy_normal.jpg","description":"IIT KGP PhD Scholar","id_on_source":"hellraider999","tweeter_id":"228427813","followers":2},"tweet_id":"594182240420003841"}]}}
