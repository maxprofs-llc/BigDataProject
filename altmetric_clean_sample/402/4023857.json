The current study focuses on a saccharopine dehydrogenase (SDH) that catalyzes the penultimate reaction in biosynthesis of the amino acid lysine (Lys), which plays a role in insect growth and carnitine production (as a substrate). The protein, provisionally designated as NlylsSDH [a SDH derived from yeast-like symbiont (YLS) in N. lugens], had a higher transcript level in abdomens, compared with heads, wings, legs and thoraces, which agrees with YLS distribution in N. lugens. Ingestion of Nlylssdh targeted double-stranded RNA (dsNlylssdh) for 5, 10 and 15 days decreased the mRNA abundance in the hoppers by 47, 70 and 31%, respectively, comparing with those ingesting normal or dsegfp diets. Nlylssdh knockdown slightly decreased the body weights, significantly delayed the development of females, and killed approximately 30% of the nymphs. Moreover, some surviving adults showed two apparent phenotypic defects: wing deformation and nymphal cuticles remained on tips of the legs and abdomens. The brachypterours\/macropterours and sex ratios (female\/male) of the adults on the dsRNA diet were lowered compared with the adults on diets without dsRNA. These results suggest that Nlylssdh encodes a functional SDH protein. The adverse effect of Nlylssdh knockdown on N. lugens implies the importance of Lys in hopper development. This study provides a proof of concept example that Nlylssdh could serve as a possible dsRNA-based pesticide for planthopper control.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000246d","authors":["Wan, P-J","Yang, L","Yuan, S-Y","Tang, Y-H","Fu, Q","Li, G-Q"],"doi":"10.1017\/s0007485315000231","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T17:06:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1475-2670"],"journal":"Bulletin of Entomological Research","last_mentioned_on":1429976224,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25908053?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25908053","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ecological Applications","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"RNA interference-aided knockdown of a putative saccharopine dehydrogenase leads to abnormal ecdysis in the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (St\u00e5l) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae).","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rna-interferenceaided-knockdown-putative-saccharopine-dehydrogenase-leads-abnormal-ecdysis-brown-pla"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5035086,"mean":5.96053209112,"rank":4208919,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5035086,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169850,"mean":8.976402274962,"rank":140689,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169850,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":290,"mean":2.1971626297578,"rank":221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":290,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.2285714285714,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/yeast_papers\/status\/591989308057227264","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4023857],"posted_on":"2015-04-25T15:37:04+00:00","author":{"name":"yeast_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yeast","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/470859351591092225\/S4XxHSFa_normal.jpeg","description":"Get your fresh daily #yeast #papers from #Pubmed, #Arxiv, #BioRxiv and #PeerJ here!
