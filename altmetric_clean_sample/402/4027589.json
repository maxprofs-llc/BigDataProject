FHSR mutations have been largely reported in the Finnish population, but in patients of Asian Indian descent, the incidence of FSHR mutations are extremely rare.\nTwo female siblings of Indian descent were diagnosed with primary ovarian failure and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. The daughters were the result of a consanguineous marriage between second cousins. A combination of CGH+SNP array and whole exome sequencing was conducted on the family to identify potential causative genetic variants.\nBoth daughters were found to have a novel pathogenic variant in FSHR (c.1253T>G, p.Ile418Ser), inherited as autosomal recessive trait from heterozygous parents. This loss of function mutation is located in exon 10 of FSHR affecting the second transmembrane helix of the FSHR protein. The transmembrane domain of FSHR is highly conserved across species and is involved in signal transduction. The FSHR c.1253T>G variant is next to a known pathogenic variant, rs12190966 (c.1255G>A, p.Ala419Thr), previously reported in a Finnish woman with primary amenorrhea.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be1","authors":["Katari, S","Wood-Trageser, M A","Jiang, H","Kalynchuk, E","Muzumdar, R","Yatsenko, S A","Rajkovic, A"],"doi":"10.1210\/jc.2015-1401","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T19:13:38+00:00","issns":["1945-7197"],"journal":"The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1429179728,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25875778?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25875778","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","endocrinology"],"title":"Novel Inactivating Mutation of the FSH Receptor in Two Siblings of Indian Origin with Premature Ovarian Failure.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-inactivating-mutation-fsh-receptor-two-siblings-indian-origin-premature-ovarian-failure"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5002950,"mean":5.926907258501,"rank":2656289,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1674810,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5002950,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169221,"mean":8.9546847417565,"rank":97142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":53778,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169221,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5267,"mean":6.2051633118116,"rank":3160,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":1225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5267,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":14.013964285714,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":5,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":4},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":13,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1,"Arts and Humanities":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Exome_seq\/status\/588648563996905472","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4027589],"posted_on":"2015-04-16T10:22:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Exome-seq","url":"http:\/\/genomics.cruk.cam.ac.uk\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/520305836476755970\/1oHrqeyl_normal.png","description":"A PubMed RSS feed for exome, by dlvr.it, http:\/\/bit.ly\/1qv7gmS, and @CIgenomics","id_on_source":"Exome_seq","tweeter_id":"2820127624","geo":{"lt":52.2,"ln":0.11667,"country":"GB"},"followers":620},"tweet_id":"588648563996905472"}]}}
