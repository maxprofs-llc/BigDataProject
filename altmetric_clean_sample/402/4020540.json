We investigated whether urinary (U) 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG)-an oxidative DNA damage marker-was related to SAR inflammatory activity.\nU-8-OHdG levels were measured in 31 SAR patients, classified as active (n=17) or non-active (n=14) based on (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography ((18)F-FDG-PET\/CT), 28 dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients, and 30 controls. In active SAR patients, U-8-OHdG levels were reexamined and compared with (18)F-FDG-PET\/CT results at 6months after corticosteroid treatment to assess therapeutic response.\nImmunohistochemical examination of left ventricle (LV) autopsy samples from SAR patients revealed positive 8-OHdG staining in cardiomyocyte nuclei from LV sections showing (18)F-FDG accumulation on PET\/CT, while serum 8-OHdG levels were significantly higher in the coronary sinus than in the aortic root only in active SAR patients. U-8-OHdG levels in SAR patients were higher than those in controls, and significantly higher in active SAR patients than in non-active SAR and DCM patients. U-8-OHdG was a powerful predictor of active SAR in receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (AUC, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.94-1.02; optimal cutoff value, 13.1ng\/mg creatinine), with a sensitivity of 88.2% and a specificity of 92.9%. U-8-OHdG levels in responders significantly decreased at 6months after corticosteroid treatment initiation, in proportion with the decrease in the focal cardiac uptake of (18)F-FDG.\nU-8-OHdG is a potentially clinically useful biomarker for evaluating inflammatory activity and monitoring the effectiveness of corticosteroid therapy in SAR patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b29","authors":["Kobayashi, Shigeki","Myoren, Takeki","Oda, Seiko","Inari, Makana","Ishiguchi, Hironori","Murakami, Wakako","Fukuda, Masakazu","Tanaka, Takeo","Okuda, Shinichi","Nao, Tomoko","Doi, Masahiro","Yamada, Jutaro","Okamura, Takayuki","Hoshii, Yoshinobu","Suga, Kazuyoshi","Matsuzaki, Masunori","Yano, Masafumi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijcard.2015.04.144","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T15:21:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1874-1754"],"journal":"International Journal of Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1456935993,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25935620?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25935620","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine as a novel biomarker of inflammatory activity in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis.","type":"article","volume":"190","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/urinary-8hydroxy2deoxyguanosine-novel-biomarker-inflammatory-activity-patients-cardiac-sarcoidosis-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7342039,"mean":6.3783632029643,"rank":3761544,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2059682,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7342039,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":213269,"mean":8.4051819213385,"rank":115934,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":76147,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":213269,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3286,"mean":2.7314185692542,"rank":1176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":1761,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3286,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105,"mean":2.8679230769231,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":58,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
