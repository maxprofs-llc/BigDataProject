While immunosuppressive drugs can prevent graft rejection to a certain degree, their efficacies are limited, transient, and associated with severe side effects. Induction of thymic central tolerance to allografts remains challenging, largely due to the difficulty of maintaining donor thymic epithelial cells (TECs) in vitro to allow successful bioengineering. Here, we show that 3-D scaffolds generated from decellularized mouse thymus can support TEC survival in culture, and maintain their unique molecular properties. When transplanted into athymic nude mice, the bioengineered thymus organoids effectively promoted homing of lymphocyte progenitors and supported thymopoiesis. Nude mice transplanted with thymus organoids promptly rejected skin allografts, and were able to mount antigen-specific humoral responses against ovalbumin upon immunization. Notably, tolerance to skin allografts was achieved by transplanting thymus organoids constructed with either TECs co-expressing both syngeneic and allogenic MHCs, or mixtures of donor and recipient TECs. Our results demonstrate the technical feasibility of restoring thymic function with bioengineered thymus organoids and highlight the clinical implications of this thymus reconstruction technique in organ transplantation and regenerative medicine.Molecular Therapy (2015); doi:10.1038\/mt.2015.77.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5083cf058f61000311d","authors":["Fan, Yong","Tajima, Asako","Goh, Saik Kia","Geng, Xuehui","Gualtierotti, Giulio","Grupillo, Maria","Coppola, Antonina","Bertera, Suzanne","Rudert, William A","Banerjee, Ipsita","Bottino, Rita","Trucco, Massimo"],"doi":"10.1038\/mt.2015.77","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T17:21:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1525-0024"],"journal":"Molecular Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1461112867,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25903472?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/mt\/rss\/aop\/~3\/CHk_39gk0hQ\/mt.2015.77","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25903472"],"pmid":"25903472","pubdate":"2015-04-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Bioengineering thymus organoids to restore thymic function and induce donor-specific immune tolerance to allografts.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bioengineering-thymus-organoids-restore-thymic-function-induce-donorspecific-immune-tolerance-allogr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":18.858,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":18.858},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7578098,"mean":6.5350293264878,"rank":389130,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7189020,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7578098,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":215468,"mean":8.4377166062554,"rank":16387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":199080,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":215468,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1190,"mean":9.0070092514718,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":1115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1190,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":12.174464285714,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
