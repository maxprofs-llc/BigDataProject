These include the extensive range of known phosphorylation site motifs for protein kinases; metal binding sites for calcium, zinc, copper, and iron; enzyme active site motifs; nucleotide binding and covalent attachment sites for prosthetic groups, carbohydrate, and lipids. Of particular notes is the increasing realization of the importance for cellular regulation of protein-protein interaction motifs and sequences that target proteins to particular subcellular locations. This article includes an introduction to accessing the many suites of programs for analysis of protein structure, signatures of protein families, and consensus sequences that may be carried out on the internet.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081de","authors":["Aitken, A"],"doi":"10.1385\/mb:12:3:241","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T19:21:27+00:00","issns":["1073-6085"],"issue":"3","journal":"Molecular Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1444633560,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10631681"],"pmid":"10631681","pubdate":"1999-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"Protein consensus sequence motifs.","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/protein-consensus-sequence-motifs-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6234309,"mean":5.9738297379616,"rank":1083028,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":5125018,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6234309,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168260,"mean":9.2589214484813,"rank":42030,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":125655,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168260,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":200,"mean":1.6901306532663,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":200,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.41666666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
