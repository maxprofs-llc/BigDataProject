VCIP135 (Valosin-containing protein p97\/p47 complex interacting protein, p135), a deubiquitinating enzyme required for p97\/p47-mediated postmitotic Golgi membrane fusion, is phosphorylated at multiple sites during mitosis. However, whether phosphorylation directly regulates VCIP135 deubiquitinase activity and Golgi membrane fusion in the cell cycle remains unknown. Here, we show that in early mitosis phosphorylation of VCIP135 by Cdk1 at a single residue, Ser130, is sufficient to inactivate the enzyme and inhibit p97\/p47-mediated Golgi membrane fusion. At the end of mitosis, VCIP135 Ser130 is dephosphorylated, which is accompanied by the recovery of its deubiquitinase activity and Golgi reassembly. Our results demonstrate that phosphorylation and ubiquitination are coordinated via VCIP135 to control Golgi membrane dynamics in the cell cycle.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c7","authors":["Zhang, Xiaoyan","Wang, Yanzhuang"],"doi":"10.1091\/mbc.e15-01-0041","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T17:24:40+00:00","funders":["nigms","niehs"],"issns":["1939-4586"],"journal":"Molecular Biology of the Cell","last_mentioned_on":1429886177,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25904330?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25904330","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"Cell cycle regulation of VCIP135 deubiquitinase activity and function in p97\/p47-mediated Golgi reassembly.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cell-cycle-regulation-vcip135-deubiquitinase-activity-function-p97p47mediated-golgi-reassembly"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5033253,"mean":5.9592311638698,"rank":4207588,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5033253,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169828,"mean":8.9753973514225,"rank":140671,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169828,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2128,"mean":3.049215796897,"rank":1939,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2128,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":5.6300869565217,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
