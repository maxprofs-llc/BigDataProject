To characterize the relevant receptors, brain areas, and circuits, detailed in vitro and in vivo studies were performed with the highly selective \u03bc opioid receptor agonist DAMGO in neuronal P450-deficient mutant (Null) and control mice. Homogenates of brain regions and spinal cord showed no differences in DAMGO-induced activation of [(35)S]- GTP\u03b3S binding between Null and control mice, indicating no genotype differences in \u00b5 opioid receptor signaling, receptor affinities or receptor densities. Intracerebroventricular (icv) DAMGO produced robust, near-maximal, analgesic responses in control mice which were attenuated by 50% in Null mice, confirming a role for \u00b5 opioid receptors in activating P450-associated responses. Intra-periaqueductal gray (PAG) and intra-rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) injections of DAMGO revealed deficits in Null (vs. control) analgesic responses, yet no such genotype differences were observed after intrathecal DAMGO administration. Taken with earlier published findings, the present results suggest that activation of \u00b5 opioid receptors in both the PAG and in the RVM relieves pain by mechanisms which include nerve-terminal P450 enzymes within inhibitory PAG-RVM projections. Spinal opioid analgesia, however, does not seem to require such P450 enzyme activity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002427","authors":["Hough, Lindsay B","Nalwalk, Julia W","Yang, Weizhu","Ding, Xinxin"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.brainres.2015.04.045","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T15:25:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1872-6240"],"journal":"Brain Research","last_mentioned_on":1430835004,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25935691?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25935691","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["brain"],"title":"Neuronal cytochrome P450 activity and opioid Analgesia: Relevant Sites and Mechanisms.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neuronal-cytochrome-p450-activity-opioid-analgesia-relevant-sites-mechanisms"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5059951,"mean":5.99355929209,"rank":2671934,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1727402,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5059951,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169041,"mean":9.020816564127,"rank":96055,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":56321,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169041,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2607,"mean":3.3420299309286,"rank":1575,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":670,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2607,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":2.0391891891892,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
