The authors developed and deployed, at two time points, a web-based survey on nine indicators of research activities with response choices reflecting the transtheoretical model of stages of behavior change. Librarians with research experience or membership in the Medical Library Association Research Section reported higher levels of having completed indicators. Our results suggest that creating awareness in precontemplation responders could encourage skill development. Mentoring and continuing education could support librarians who are contemplating or preparing to perform indicator activities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f6d","authors":["Mazure, Emily S","Alpi, Kristine M"],"doi":"10.3163\/1536-5050.103.2.007","endpage":"95","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T16:33:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1558-9439","1536-5050"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of the Medical Library Association","last_mentioned_on":1441377368,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25918489?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=4melow","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4404862\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4404862\/?hootPostID=83cafeb89f2daa0f154cf8c67ce51812"],"pmid":"25918489","pubdate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Library And Information Studies","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"91","subjects":["libraryscience"],"title":"Librarian readiness for research partnerships","type":"article","volume":"103","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/librarian-readiness-research-partnerships"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.05,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8180362,"mean":6.9194144321931,"rank":1329293,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":6846877,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8180362,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":218883,"mean":8.6715459562688,"rank":46197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":172502,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":218883,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":486,"mean":5.9466927835052,"rank":117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":385,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":486,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":12.857142857143,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Librarian":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
