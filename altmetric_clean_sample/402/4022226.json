To the best of our knowledge, this report includes the first case of mumps-associated pharyngolaryngeal edema in a patient who had previously received mumps vaccination, and these cases represent the sixth report of mumps-associated pharyngolaryngeal edema in the English literature. All 5 of our patients with mumps infection were adults and manifested airway stenosis due to pharyngolaryngeal edema. This edema responded favorably to steroid treatment without tracheotomy. We conclude that a pharyngolaryngeal examination is recommended for patients with mumps infection. Steroid treatment is usually effective against pharyngolaryngeal edema; however, in certain cases tracheotomy may be inevitable.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027db","authors":["Ohki, Masafumi","Baba, Yuka","Kikuchi, Shigeru","Ohata, Atsushi","Tsutsumi, Takeshi","Tanaka, Sunao","Tahara, Atsushi","Urata, Shinji","Ishikawa, Junichi"],"first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T16:14:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1942-7522"],"issue":"4-5","journal":"ENT: Ear, Nose & Throat Journal","last_mentioned_on":1430401085,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25923277?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25923277","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"Potentially lethal pharyngolaryngeal edema with dyspnea in adult patients with mumps: A series of 5 cases.","type":"article","volume":"94","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/potentially-lethal-pharyngolaryngeal-edema-dyspnea-adult-patients-mumps-series-5-cases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5042235,"mean":5.975453691361,"rank":2661768,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1722178,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5042235,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168804,"mean":9.0038922412518,"rank":95822,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":56371,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168804,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":318,"mean":1.2888012618297,"rank":70,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":59,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":318,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.0192307692308,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/OTO_docs\/status\/593771305888972800","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4022226],"posted_on":"2015-04-30T13:38:05+00:00","author":{"name":"OTOdocs","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/451475015045615617\/pvQ7oTD5_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Otolaryngology papers in #PubMed and #arXiv.","id_on_source":"OTO_docs","tweeter_id":"2424371810","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":385},"tweet_id":"593771305888972800"}]}}
