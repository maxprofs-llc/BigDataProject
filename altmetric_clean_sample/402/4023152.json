The splenocyte proliferation assay was performed to study in-vitro immunomodulatory activity of MEAC, where sheep RBC (SRBC) was used to induce immune responses in the experimental animals. The in-vivo immunomodulatory activity was evaluated by humoral antibody titer, quantification of plaque forming cells, qualitative hemolysis, delayed type hypersensitivity assay, phagocytic index and neutrophil adhesion assays. The chemoprotective effect of MEAC was determined against cyclophosphamide induced immunosuppression in mice models. MEAC exhibited significant mitogenic and co-mitogenic activity on Con-A, PHA and LPS stimulated splenocytes isolated from mouse spleen in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, MEAC also elicited significant immunomodulatory activity with enhanced activation of humoral immune response along with a suppressive effect on cell mediated immune response. Hematological and histopathological analysis revealed the protective effect of MEAC against CP induced immunosuppression. The significant immunomodulatory activity of MEAC observed in the current study could be due to the fatty acids and phytosterols present in the extract.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028f2","authors":["Raj, Sreena","Gothandam, K M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.fct.2015.04.026","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T16:41:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-6351"],"journal":"Food & Chemical Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1430302718,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25916916?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25916916","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Immunomodulatory activity of methanolic extract of Amorphophallus commutatus var. wayanadensis under normal and cyclophosphamide induced immunosuppressive conditions in mice models.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/immunomodulatory-activity-methanolic-extract-amorphophallus-commutatus-var-wayanadensis-under-normal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037611,"mean":5.97497561185,"rank":4190967,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037611,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168715,"mean":9.0067586448074,"rank":139040,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168715,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1385,"mean":7.3615187861272,"rank":1096,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1385,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":3.8611111111111,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
