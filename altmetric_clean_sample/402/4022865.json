Azole antifungals are the treatment of choice, however, resistance has arisen against these compounds, which could lead to devastating consequences. Therefore, it is important to understand how these fungicides are used and how the resistance arises to fully tackle the problem. Here, we give an overview of the problem and discuss the mechanisms that mediate azole resistance in agriculture (point mutations in the CYP51 amino acid sequence, overexpression of the CYP51 enzyme and overexpression of genes encoding efflux pumps proteins).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100066eb","authors":["Price, Claire L","Parker, Josie E","Warrilow, Andrew G S","Kelly, Diane E","Kelly, Steven L","Warrilow, Andrew GS"],"doi":"10.1002\/ps.4029","endpage":"1058","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T16:33:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1526-4998"],"issue":"8","journal":"Pest Management Science","last_mentioned_on":1460069466,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25914201?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ps.4029\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ps.4029\/pdf","pmid":"25914201","pubdate":"2015-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Science And Management","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"1054","title":"Azole fungicides\u00a0\u2013\u00a0understanding resistance mechanisms in agricultural fungal pathogens","type":"article","volume":"71","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/azole-fungicides-understanding-resistance-mechanisms-agricultural-fungal-pathogens"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7516464,"mean":6.5017388130518,"rank":1679983,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":5803473,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7516464,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":215127,"mean":8.424790559951,"rank":60723,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":153387,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":215127,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":741,"mean":3.4756675675676,"rank":138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":599,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":741,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":6.9117692307692,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
