These results led us to propose a model of a developmental switch in B lymphopoiesis, similar to the well-known switch in fetal to adult erythropoiesis. More recent global analysis of mRNA and microRNA expression comparing these two types of pro-B cells revealed differential expression of Lin28b and microRNAs from the Let-7 family, indicating that this regulatory axis plays a role in the switch. Further analysis has provided data supporting this model, implicating Arid3a as a key transcription factor in mediating fetal-type B cell development. Function of this regulatory axis in human B lineage precursors may also explain the predominance of CD5(+) B cells in cord blood. We suggest that Lin28b-promoted B cell development generates many cells expressing CD5 as a consequence of positively selected self-reactivity. While such cells serve a useful role in clearance of senescent cells and in certain immune responses, they also carry the risk of progression to leukemia\/lymphoma later in life.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51b3cf058f6100038d2","authors":["Li, Yue-Sheng","Zhou, Yan","Tang, Lingjuan","Shinton, Susan A","Hayakawa, Kyoko","Hardy, Richard R"],"doi":"10.1111\/nyas.12769","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T15:40:33+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid"],"issns":["1749-6632"],"issue":"1","journal":"Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1461418834,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25931205?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25931205","pubdate":"2015-12-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"A developmental switch between fetal and adult B lymphopoiesis.","type":"article","volume":"1362","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/developmental-switch-between-fetal-adult-b-lymphopoiesis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7591700,"mean":6.5431604635494,"rank":5476206,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1846591,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7591700,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":215555,"mean":8.4386621913768,"rank":139042,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":63683,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":215555,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4667,"mean":5.245415773682,"rank":3914,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":657,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4667,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":2.606262295082,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
