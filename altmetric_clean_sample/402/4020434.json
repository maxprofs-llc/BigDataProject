These patients were divided into down-staging group and non-down-staging group according to the change of staging in accordance with TNM classification for rectal cancer after neoadjuvant therapy. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the proportions of Treg cells, CD4+T cells, CD8+T cells, NK cells, B cells, and CD4+\/CD8+ ratio in the peripheral blood from these patients before and after neoadjuvant therapy.\nA total of 108 patients were enrolled, including 76 cases in the down staging group and 32 cases in the non-down-staging group. Differences of immune cells proportions between two groups before neoadjuvant therapy were not statistically significant(all P>0.05). In the down-staging group, the proportions of Treg cells, B cells and CD4+\/CD8+ ratio were decreased while the proportion of NK cells did not change obviously after the neoadjuvant therapy. Interestingly, in the non-down-staging group, the proportions of B cells and CD4+\/CD8+ ratio were decreased while the proportions of Treg cells and NK cells did not change obviously after the neoadjuvant therapy. In addition, after neoadjunvat therapy, the proportion of Treg cells in down-staging group was significantly lower than that in non-down-staging group [(4.4\u00b11.7)% vs. (6.2\u00b11.9)%, P=0.001].\nFor patients in the down-staging group after neoadjuvant therapy, the proportion of Treg cells in peripheral blood decreases, suggesting that Treg cells may be a valuable biomarker for assessing tumor regression.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9283cf058f61000dd2d","authors":["Wang, Haibo","Liu, Haiyi","Su, Wen","Zhang, Yixun","Feng, Yi","Lu, Yanjun"],"first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T15:17:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1671-0274"],"issue":"4","journal":"Zhonghua wei chang wai ke za zhi Chinese journal of gastrointestinal surgery","last_mentioned_on":1450350303,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25940180?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25940180?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25940180","pubdate":"2015-04-25T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","gastroenterology"],"title":"[Relationship between CD4(+)CD25(High)CD127(low) regularly T cells in the peripheral blood and tumor regression after neoadjuvant therapy in patients with rectal cancer].","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/relationship-between-cd4cd25highcd127low-regularly-t-cells-peripheral-blood-tumor-regression-after-n-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6787729,"mean":6.1724472011828,"rank":4796836,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1746113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6787729,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":210898,"mean":8.3318553227406,"rank":134729,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":63373,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":210898,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253,"mean":0.46507936507937,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":221,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":0.42307692307692,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NK_papers\/status\/595893901132701696","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4020434],"posted_on":"2015-05-06T10:12:31+00:00","author":{"name":"NK papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/573591369375031296\/MLLMIFLv_normal.png","description":"Paper Twitterbot for academics with an interest in NK cell biology.","id_on_source":"NK_papers","tweeter_id":"2369366659","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":221},"tweet_id":"595893901132701696"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IL7Papers\/statuses\/677444388461477888","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4020434],"posted_on":"2015-12-17T11:05:03+00:00","author":{"name":"IL7Papers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"IL7Papers","tweeter_id":"4010117872","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":9},"tweet_id":"677444388461477888"}]}}
