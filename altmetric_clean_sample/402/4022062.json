Cytarabine (Ara-C) is a key drug in the treatment of AML patients, there is still uncertainly regarding its optimal dose and infusion schedule. The aim of this study is to examine the impact of the Ara-C infusion schedule used as part of an intensive salvage regimen, in patients with relapsed or refractory AML.\n252 adult patients (median age 59 years) with relapsed or refractory AML were randomly allocated to receive either Mito-FLAG with Ara-C as bolus (B) (1000 mg\/m(2) over 1 hour, every 12 hours, days 1-5), or continuous infusion (CI) (150 mg\/m(2) over 24 hours, days 1-5) in combination with mitoxantrone, fludarabine, and G-CSF. Autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation was offered as consolidation therapy. Primary endpoint was the rate of complete remissions (CR) after the first cycle of Mito-FLAG.\nThe complete remission rates after Mito-FLAG (B) and Mito-FLAG (CI) were 54% and 43%, respectively (p= .1). There was no statistical difference between rates of grade 3\/4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, mucositis, renal and liver toxicity. More infections occurred, however, after Mito-FLAG (B) compared to Mito-FLAG (CI) (80% versus 69%, p= .01). The early death rate by day 42 was 13% in both arms. Median disease-free survival was comparable in the two arms (7.8 versus 7.1 months, p= .53) as was overall survival (7.1 versus 6.6 months, p= .53).\nA five day course of Ara-C 2x1000 mg\/m(2) administered as bolus versus Ara-C 150 mg\/m(2) administered by continuous infusion (in combination with mitoxantrone, fludarabine, and G-CSF), resulted in a non-significant trend in response rates in favor of Mito-FLAG (B) at the selected dose-levels, but no differences in survival outcome in relapsed or refractory AML.\nLN_NN_2004_39\/ EudraCT number 2014-000083-18.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002280","authors":["Thiel, A","Schetelig, J","P\u00f6nisch, W","Sch\u00e4fer-Eckart, K","Aulitzky, W","Peter, N","Schulze, A","Maschmeyer, G","Neugebauer, S","Herbst, R","H\u00e4nel, A","Morgner, A","Kroschinsky, F","Bornh\u00e4user, M","Lange, T","Wilhelm, M","Niederwieser, D","Ehninger, G","Fiedler, F","H\u00e4nel, M",", "],"doi":"10.1093\/annonc\/mdv205","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T16:08:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1569-8041","0923-7534"],"journal":"Annals of Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1459937554,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25922062?dopt=Abstract&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25922062?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25922062","pubdate":"2015-04-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Mito-FLAG with Ara-C as Bolus versus Continuous Infusion in Recurrent or Refractory AML - Long-term Results of a Prospective Randomized Intergroup Study of the East German Study Group Hematology\/Oncology (OSHO) and the Study Alliance Leukemia (SAL).","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mitoflag-arac-bolus-versus-continuous-infusion-recurrent-refractory-amllongterm-results-prospective"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7506617,"mean":6.4985319251666,"rank":3871158,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2100768,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7506617,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":215025,"mean":8.4217171106483,"rank":117020,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":76575,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":215025,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3267,"mean":8.114709736681,"rank":2112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":816,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3267,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114,"mean":9.0711681415929,"rank":100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
