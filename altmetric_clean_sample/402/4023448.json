However, little is known about the role of the ECS in tumor progression. Here we report the correlation between CB 2 expression and pathological data in a series of 175 colorectal cancer patients, as well as the response of the HT29 colon cancer-derived cell line upon CB 2 activation. CB 2 mRNA was detected in 28.6% of samples tested. It was more frequent in N+ patients and predicts disease free survival and overall survival in colon cancer. In positive samples, CB 2 was expressed with great intensity in tumor epithelial cells and correlated with tumor growth. Treatment of HT29 with CB 2 agonist revealed membrane loss of E-cadherin and SNAIL1 overexpression. A direct correlation between CB 2 and SNAIL1 expression was also found in human tumors. CB 2 receptor expression is a poor prognostic marker for colon cancer and the activation of this receptor, with non-apoptotic doses of agonists, could be collaborating with disease progression. These results raise the question whether the activation of CB 2 should be considered as anti-tumoral therapy.","altmetric_jid":"57da952eaee83e3eee8b458f","authors":["Mart\u00ednez-Mart\u00ednez, Esther","G\u00f3mez, Irene","Mart\u00edn, Paloma","S\u00e1nchez, Antonio","Rom\u00e1n, Laura","Tejerina, Eva","Bonilla, F\u00e9lix","Merino, Antonio Garc\u00eda","de Herreros, Antonio Garc\u00eda","Provencio, Mariano","Garc\u00eda, Jose M","Esther Martinez-Martinez","Irene Gomez","Paloma Martin","Antonio Sanchez","Laura Roman","Eva Tejerina","Felix Bonilla","Antonio Garcia-Merino","Antonio Garcia de Herreros","Mariano Provencio","Jose M.
