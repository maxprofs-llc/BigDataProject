No study has examined the frequency and clinical relevance of vitamin D deficiency in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD).\nVitamin D levels were measured in 22 PCD patients (7 females, 10.5\u00a0years, range, 2-34 years). In PCD, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), sputum microbiology, self-reported physical activity (PA) level, and quality of life (QoL) by means of the Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), were also assessed.\nSeventy-two percent of PCD patients were vitamin-D deficient-to-insufficient and 28% were sufficient. No differences in PFTs parameters were found between vitamin D deficiency-to-insufficiency and sufficiency groups. Patients with vitamin D deficiency-to-insufficiency had significantly higher SGRQ total scores, and thus poorer QoL (p\u2009=\u20090.03). Seventy-nine percent of PCD subjects had limitations in performing vigorous activities, and 53% performed less than 3\u00a0hours of PA per week. Vitamin D deficiency-to-insufficiency and sufficiency groups did not show any differences in age at PCD diagnosis or at onset of respiratory symptoms, BMI, atopy, current asthma or bronchiectasis. However, 79% of patients with bronchiectasis had vitamin D deficiency-to-insufficiency. No differences were found in the rate of positive sputum cultures and in the number of antibiotic courses between the two groups.\nHypovitaminosis D is common in PCD patients, and is associated with poorer QoL. We recommend the assessment and treatment of hypovitaminosis D to be included in the routine management of PCD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000842","authors":["Mirra, Virginia","Caffarelli, Carlo","Maglione, Marco","Valentino, Rossella","Perruolo, Giuseppe","Mazzarella, Claudia","Di Micco, Laida Lisa","Montella, Silvia","Santamaria, Francesca","Virginia Mirra","Carlo Caffarelli","Marco Maglione","Rossella Valentino","Giuseppe Perruolo","Claudia Mazzarella","Laida Di Micco","Silvia Montella","Francesca Santamaria"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13052-015-0119-5","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T18:33:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1824-7288"],"issue":"1","journal":"Italian Journal of Pediatrics","last_mentioned_on":1455016476,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25887861?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25887861?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25887861","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Maternal and Child Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pediatrics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Hypovitaminosis D: a novel finding in primary ciliary dyskinesia.","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hypovitaminosis-d-novel-finding-primary-ciliary-dyskinesia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7156405,"mean":6.3086437613049,"rank":6164044,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7156405,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":212589,"mean":8.377487035957,"rank":178968,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":212589,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":326,"mean":2.7854092307692,"rank":237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":326,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":2.1055555555556,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
