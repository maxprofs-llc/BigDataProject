Animals were given access to either ground Purina Chow or one of two dietary self-selection regimes, one with a high-fat ration (7.8 kcal\/g) and the other with a fat ration isocaloric to the carbohydrate and protein rations (3.8 kcal\/g). Animals received morphine injections at the beginning of a six-hour feeding period and nutrient intakes were measured at 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours postinjection. Similar patterns of macronutrient choice were observed for both animals maintained on the high-fat regime and animals with access to the isocaloric components following morphine injections. As a function of morphine injections, animals on both self-selection regimes increased fat intake while suppressing carbohydrate intake and exhibiting little modifications in protein intake.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032e3","authors":["Marks-Kaufman, R"],"first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T18:13:14+00:00","issns":["0091-3057"],"issue":"6","journal":"Pharmacology, Biochemistry & Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1429566131,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7111355"],"pmid":"7111355","pubdate":"1982-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychopharmacology","behavioralsciences","pharmacology","biochemistry"],"title":"Increased fat consumption induced by morphine administration in rats.","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increased-fat-consumption-induced-morphine-administration-rats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5017345,"mean":5.9416736189543,"rank":4195225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5017345,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169485,"mean":8.970086143825,"rank":140366,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169485,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1064,"mean":3.1274261523989,"rank":875,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1064,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.8642857142857,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
