Considering the magnitude of concentrations (ng\u2009L(-1) to mg\u2009L(-1)) and their often-specific modes of action, the assessment of physiological responses of exposed aquatic biota may provide significant information regarding the potential ecological consequences of exposure to these contaminants. The present study intended to assess the acute and chronic effects of four pharmaceuticals: acetaminophen, chlorpromazine, diclofenac sodium and propranolol in the cladoceran species Daphnia magna. Parameters such as immobility, total of offspring and rate of population increase were analyzed. Results of acute exposures showed a considerable variability of toxicity among pharmaceuticals, with the following ranking of toxicity: diclofenac (EC50\u2009=\u2009123.3\u2009mg\u2009L(-1))\u2009<\u2009propranolol (EC50\u2009=\u20095.531\u2009mg\u2009L(-1))\u2009<\u2009acetaminophen (EC50\u2009=\u20092.831\u2009mg\u2009L(-1))\u2009<\u2009chlorpromazine (EC50\u2009=\u20091.805\u2009mg\u2009L(-1)). The chronic toxicity data showed the exertion of reproductive adverse effects. The compounds chlorpromazine and propranolol caused a significant decrease in fecundity, and the rate of population increase parameter suffered a significant decrease from 0.33\u2009mg\u2009L(-1) to 0.128\u2009mg\u2009L(-1) onwards, respectively. The levels of exposure to which our test organism was acutely and chronically exposed were above those already reported in the wild. Nevertheless, the extensive production, prescription and release of pharmaceuticals drugs will continue to grow in the future, and consequently their loadings to the environment can result in potential long-term ecological risks to aquatic biota.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5233cf058f610003ba8","authors":["de Oliveira, Laira L Damasceno","Antunes, Sara Cristina","Gon\u00e7alves, Fernando","Rocha, Odete","Nunes, Bruno"],"doi":"10.3109\/01480545.2015.1029048","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T19:39:10+00:00","issns":["1525-6014"],"journal":"Drug & Chemical Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1429009509,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25864724?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25864724","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Acute and chronic ecotoxicological effects of four pharmaceuticals drugs on cladoceran Daphnia magna.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/acute-chronic-ecotoxicological-effects-four-pharmaceuticals-drugs-cladoceran-idaphnia-magnai"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5033220,"mean":5.9655498050018,"rank":3544424,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":840257,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5033220,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169810,"mean":8.9825663539624,"rank":123364,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":29207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169810,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":204,"mean":1.8580591133005,"rank":101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":204,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
