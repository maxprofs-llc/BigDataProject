Secondary end points included: trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) response; peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) response; seven-question Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-7) score.\nAt Week 52, adverse-event (AE) rates with tiotropium 5 \u03bcg, 2.5 \u03bcg and placebo were 88.6%, 86.8% and 89.5%, respectively. Commonly reported AEs with tiotropium 5 \u03bcg, 2.5 \u03bcg and placebo were nasopharyngitis (48.2%, 44.7%, 42.1%), asthma (28.9%, 29.8%, 38.6%), decreased PEFR (15.8%, 7.9%, 21.1%), bronchitis (9.6%, 13.2%, 7.0%), pharyngitis (7.9%, 13.2%, 3.5%) and gastroenteritis (10.5%, 3.5%, 5.3%). In the tiotropium 5 \u03bcg, 2.5 \u03bcg and placebo groups, 8.8%, 5.3% and 5.3% of patients reported drug-related AEs; 3.5%, 3.5% and 15.8% reported serious AEs. Asthma worsening was the only serious AE reported in more than one patient. At Week 52, adjusted mean trough FEV1 and trough PEFR responses were significantly higher with tiotropium 5 \u03bcg (but not 2.5 \u03bcg) versus placebo. ACQ-7 responder rates were higher with tiotropium 5 \u03bcg and 2.5 \u03bcg versus placebo at Week 24.\nThe long-term tiotropium Respimat safety profile was comparable with that of placebo Respimat, and associated with mild to moderate, non-serious AEs in patients with symptomatic asthma despite ICS\u00b1LABA therapy. Compared with placebo, tiotropium 5 \u03bcg, but not 2.5 \u03bcg, significantly improved lung function and symptoms, supporting the long-term efficacy of the 5 \u03bcg dose.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT01340209.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Ohta, Ken","Ichinose, Masakazu","Tohda, Yuji","Engel, Michael","Moroni-Zentgraf, Petra","Kunimitsu, Satoko","Sakamoto, Wataru","Adachi, Mitsuru"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0124109","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T17:50:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"4","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1473565945,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25894430?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25894430?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25894430","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25894430"],"pmid":"25894430","pubdate":"2015-04-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0124109","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Long-Term Once-Daily Tiotropium Respimat\u00ae Is Well Tolerated and Maintains Efficacy over 52 Weeks in Patients with Symptomatic Asthma in Japan: A Randomised, Placebo-Controlled Study.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/longterm-oncedaily-tiotropium-respimat-tolerated-maintains-efficacy-52-weeks-patients-symptomatic-as"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8360145,"mean":7.0505745135414,"rank":6045388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2015875,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8360145,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":220021,"mean":8.7081505590402,"rank":142423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":64642,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":220021,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115499,"mean":10.629120538884,"rank":78562,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":31097,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115499,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6087,"mean":9.6376694051923,"rank":4263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1465,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6087,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
