Prompted by the hypothesis that neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction underlies chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI), we explored the efficacy of administering the small molecule pifithrin (PFT)-\u00b5, an inhibitor of mitochondrial p53 accumulation, in preventing CICI. Male C57BL\/6J mice injected with cisplatin +\/- PFT-\u00b5 for two 5-day cycles were assessed for cognitive function using novel object\/place recognition and alternation in a Y-maze. Cisplatin impaired performance in the novel object\/place recognition and Y-maze tests. PFT-\u00b5 treatment prevented CICI and associated cisplatin-induced changes in coherency of myelin basic protein fibers in the cingular cortex and loss of doublecortin+ cells in the subventricular zone and hippocampal dentate gyrus. Mechanistically, cisplatin decreased spare respirator capacity of brain synaptosomes and caused abnormal mitochondrial morphology, which was counteracted by PFT-\u00b5 administration. Notably, increased mitochondrial p53 did not lead to cerebral caspase-3 activation or cytochrome-c release. Furthermore, PFT-\u00b5 administration did not impair the anticancer efficacy of cisplatin and radiotherapy in tumor-bearing mice. Our results supported the hypothesis that neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction induced by mitochondrial p53 accumulation is an underlying cause of CICI, and that PFT-\u00b5 may offer a tractable therapeutic strategy to limit this common side-effect of many types of chemotherapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dd4","authors":["Gabriel S.
