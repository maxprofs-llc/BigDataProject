Cardiogenic shock was predominantly attributable to left ventricular (LV) failure in 815 Registry patients for whom temporal data were available. We examined factors related to the timing of shock onset and the relation of temporal onset to in-hospital outcomes.\nOverall, shock developed a median of 6.2 h after MI symptom onset. Shock onset varied by culprit artery: left main, median 1.7 h; right, 3.5 h; circumflex, 3.9 h; left anterior descending (LAD), 11.0 h; saphenous vein graft, 10.9 h (p = 0.025). Early shock (< 24 h) occurred in 74.1% and was associated with chest pain at shock onset, ST-segment elevation in two or more leads, multiple infarct locations, inferior MI, left main disease and smoking. Late shock (> or = 24 h) was associated with recurrent ischemia, Q waves in two or more leads and LAD culprit vessel. Mortality was higher in patients with early versus late shock (62.6% vs. 53.6%, p = 0.022).\nShock onset after acute MI occurred within 24 h in 74% of the patients with predominant LV failure. Mortality was slightly higher in patients developing shock early rather than later. Many factors influence when shock develops, which has implications for its management.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f57","authors":["John G Webb","Lynn A Sleeper","Christopher E Buller","Jean Boland","Angela Palazzo","Elizabeth Buller","Harvey D White","Judith S Hochman"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0735-1097(00)00876-7","first_seen_on":"2017-02-01T11:43:11+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["07351097","0735-1097"],"issue":"3 Suppl A","journal":"Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC)","last_mentioned_on":1262649600,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0735-1097(00)00876-7"],"pmid":"10985709","pubdate":"2000-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Implications of the timing of onset of cardiogenic shock after acute myocardial infarction: a report from the SHOCK Trial Registry","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0735109700008767","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/implications-timing-onset-cardiogenic-shock-after-acute-myocardial-infarction-report-shock-trial-reg"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7072903,"mean":6.2890406842877,"rank":1664174,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4568118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7072903,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93767,"mean":11.200862274172,"rank":28669,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":63542,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93767,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5728,"mean":14.688479832373,"rank":2716,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":2411,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5728,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":54.446818181818,"rank":79,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":4,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":12}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"policy":[{"title":"Infarkt-bedingter kardiogener Schock -
