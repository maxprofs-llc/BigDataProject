Site-specific expression in mice leads to cancer development (e.g., breast, lymphoma) indicating the oncogenic nature of CK2. CK2 is involved in many key aspects of cancer including inhibition of apoptosis, modulation of signaling pathways, DNA damage response, and cell cycle regulation. A number of CK2 inhibitors are now available and have been shown to have activity against various cancers in vitro and in pre-clinical models. Some of these inhibitors are now undergoing exploration in clinical trials as well. In this review, we will examine some of the major cancers in which CK2 inhibition has promise based on in vitro and pre-clinical studies, the proposed cellular and signaling mechanisms of anti-cancer activity by CK2 inhibitors, and the current or recent clinical trials using CK2 inhibitors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043bf","authors":["Melissa Chua","Charina Ortega","Ayesha Sheikh","Migi Lee","Hussein Abdul-Rassoul","Kevan Hartshorn","Isabel Dominguez"],"doi":"10.3390\/ph10010018","first_seen_on":"2017-02-01T08:41:23+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms"],"issns":["1424-8247"],"issue":"1","journal":"Pharmaceuticals","last_mentioned_on":1486950853,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3390\/ph10010018","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8247\/10\/1\/18"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8247\/10\/1\/18\/pdf","pmid":"28134850","pubdate":"2017-01-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"CK2 in Cancer: Cellular and Biochemical Mechanisms and Potential Therapeutic Target","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ck2-cancer-cellular-biochemical-mechanisms-potential-therapeutic-target-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":10,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8204367,"mean":6.945700472644,"rank":829217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7340903,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8204367,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":265826,"mean":12.825929795918,"rank":42575,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":222427,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":265826,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":308,"mean":3.2983973941368,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":280,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":308,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":2.3224137931034,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
