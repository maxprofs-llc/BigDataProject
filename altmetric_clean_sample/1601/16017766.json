Case subjects were patients treated with resectional arthroplasty and control subjects received standard nonsurgical care. Both groups received standard off-loading and wound care. Outcomes included time to healing, reulceration, infection, and amputation.\nThe surgery group healed significantly faster than patients in the standard therapy group (standard 67.1 +\/- 17.1 versus surgery 24.2 +\/- 9.9 days, P = 0.0001), and they had fewer recurrent ulcers (standard 35.0 versus surgery 4.8%, P = 0.02, odds ratio 7.6, 95% CI 1.1-261.7) Both groups had similar rates of infection (standard 38.1 versus surgery 40.0%, P = 0.9) and amputation (standard 10.0 versus surgery 4.8%, P = 0.5).\nResults suggest that resectional arthroplasty is a safe and effective procedure to treat wounds of the plantar hallux compared with nonsurgical therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026f8","authors":["David G.
