Thirty-two diabetic patients were included in a first historic group from 1986 to 1993, treated by antibiotic therapy, offloading, and wound care. Thirty-two patients were included from September 1993 to March 1995, treated by the same medical treatment and conservative orthopedic surgery.\nThe healing rate was 57% in the group treated by the medical treatment alone versus 78% in the surgical group (P < 0.008). The duration of healing was 462 +\/- 98 days versus 181 +\/- 30 days (P < 0.008).\nConservative surgery contributes to an increase in the healing rate of foot ulcers with osteomyelitis compared with a medical treatment alone.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026f8","authors":["Georges Ha Van","Hubert Siney","Jean-Paul Danan","Claude Sachon","Andr\u00e9
