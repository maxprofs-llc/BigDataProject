The cell utilises glucose oxidase and bilirubin oxidase immobilised on nanoporous gold. The power output of the cell decreases with increasing solvent hydrophobicity in the alcohols, methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH), 1-propanol (PrOH), 1-butanol (BuOH) and 1-pentanol (PeOH).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024e2","authors":["Xiao, Xinxin","Magner, Edmond","Xinxin Xiao","Edmond Magner"],"doi":"10.1039\/c5cc04888e","endpage":"13480","first_seen_on":"2016-04-14T14:13:38+00:00","issns":["1364-548X","1359-7345"],"issue":"70","journal":"Chemical Communications","last_mentioned_on":1465311633,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlelanding\/2015\/cc\/c5cc04888e#.V1bhj9Xr8sE.twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2015\/cc\/c5cc04888e","pmid":"26214173","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Materials Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"13478","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"A biofuel cell in non-aqueous solution","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/xlink.rsc.org\/?DOI=C5CC04888E","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biofuel-cell-nonaqueous-solution"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7866440,"mean":6.6628832942016,"rank":4121714,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2192849,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7866440,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272505,"mean":11.408058046854,"rank":148149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":97823,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272505,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5641,"mean":3.0081485815603,"rank":2521,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":2131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5641,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":199,"mean":2.7580909090909,"rank":101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":199,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Chemistry":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Xinxin_Xiao1989\/statuses\/740196755833298944","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6701373],"posted_on":"2016-06-07T15:00:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Xinxin Xiao","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/747829203710676992\/8Cq4SSpZ_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"Xinxin_Xiao1989","tweeter_id":"706483821315751936","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":8},"tweet_id":"740196755833298944"}]}}
