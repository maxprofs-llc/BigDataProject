Proton pump inhibitors have been shown to interfere with the liver metabolism of clopidogrel. However, there is Iimited data on any direct effects proton pump inhibitors may have on clopidogrel. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether the in vitro addition of pantoprazole affects platelet aggregation in blood samples from clopidogrel and aspirin treated patients. Blood samples were drawn from 66 patients on clopidogrel and aspirin who underwent coronary angiography. Platelet aggregation was analysed using the bed-side Plateletworks assay before and after the addition of two different amounts of pantoprazole. The addition of 2.5 \u00b5l (4 mg\/ml) pantoprazole, final concentration 0.01 mg\/ml, was followed by a significant reduction (26%, p=<0.001) of platelet aggregation which was further reduced (39%, p=<0.001) when a higher dose, 10 \u00b5l (4 mg\/ml), final concentration 0.04 mg\/ml, was added. In conclusion, platelet aggregation was significantly decreased by in vitro addition of pantoprazole. To explore the clinical relevance of this, future studies are needed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bb9","authors":["Karlsson, Elias","Holm, Manne","van der Linden, Jan A."],"doi":"10.1097\/fjc.0000000000000401","endpage":"195","first_seen_on":"2016-05-01T09:41:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1533-4023","0160-2446"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1474360007,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/cardiovascularpharm\/9000\/00000\/The_in_vitro_effects_of_pantoprazole_on_platelet.98796.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/cardiovascularpharm\/Abstract\/2016\/09000\/In_Vitro_Effects_of_Pantoprazole_on_Platelet.2.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/cardiovascularpharm\/9000\/00000\/The_in_vitro_effects_of_pantoprazole_on_platelet.98796.pdf","pmid":"27110745","pubdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["pharmacology","cardiology"],"title":"The in vitro effects of pantoprazole on platelet aggregation in blood samples from clopidogrel and aspirin treated patients","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/cardiovascularpharm\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/The_in_vitro_effects_of_pantoprazole_on_platelet.98796.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vitro-effects-pantoprazole-platelet-aggregation-blood-samples-clopidogrel-aspirintreated-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":6381838,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1141212,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271643,"mean":11.585260305843,"rank":189735,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":44971,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271643,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1182,"mean":2.0779068585944,"rank":450,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1182,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":0.86034482758621,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JofCVPonline\/statuses\/726705946156617728","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7100665],"posted_on":"2016-05-01T09:32:53+00:00","author":{"name":"JofCVPharmacology","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1611389347\/JCVPharma_Cover_-_Twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Editor-in-Chief: Michael R.
