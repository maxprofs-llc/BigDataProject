Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain E3T belongs to the genus Paenibacillus with Paenibacillus thailandensis S3-4AT (96.0%), Paenibacillus xanthinilyticus 11N27T (95.7%), Paenibacillus mendelii C\/2T (95.7%) and other members of the genus Paenibacillus (<95.5%) as its closest phylogenetic neighbours. The DNA G+C content of strain E3T was 53 mol%. Strain E3T was positive for gelatin hydrolysis, ammonification, catalase, chitinase production, ACC deaminase activity, HCN production, siderophore production, biofilm formation, urea and starch hydrolysis. Strain E3T has phosphatidylethanolamine, diphosphotidylglycerol, an unidentified aminophospholipid (APL-1), two unidentified aminolipids (AL1,2) and two unidentified lipids (L1,2) as polar lipids. Strain E3T has diploptene, deplopterol and bacteriohopaneterol as major hopanoids. Anteiso-C15:0 is the predominant cellular fatty acid with significant proportions of iso-C16:0, C16:0, C17:0, anteiso-C17:0, C18:1\u03c99c and iso-C14:0. Strain E3T has meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid in the cell-wall peptidoglycan. On the basis of physiological, biochemical, chemotaxonomic and molecular analysis, strain E3T represents a new species of the genus Paenibacillus, for which the name Paenibacillus arachidis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is E3T (=KCTC 33574T =LMG 28417T).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079fb","authors":["K, Sadaf","L, Tushar","P, Nirosha","A R, Podile","Ch, Sasikala","Ch V, Ramana"],"doi":"10.1099\/ijsem.0.001124","first_seen_on":"2016-05-01T10:09:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1466-5034","1466-5026"],"journal":"International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1462097147,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27129367?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27129367","pubdate":"2016-04-29T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Paenibacillus arachidis sp. nov., isolated from groundnut seeds","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7632130,"mean":6.5668397124796,"rank":6605606,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7632130,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266126,"mean":11.384988204791,"rank":222843,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266126,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3483,"mean":2.6851344055141,"rank":2981,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3483,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116,"mean":1.22,"rank":71,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/biofilmPapers\/statuses\/726714225385566208","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7101150],"posted_on":"2016-05-01T10:05:47+00:00","author":{"name":"Biofilm Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/585213267288653824\/evf5BSKg_normal.jpg","description":"Stay on top of all the latest publications on Biofilm research curated from PubMed. #biofilm #microbiology #antibioticresistance.
