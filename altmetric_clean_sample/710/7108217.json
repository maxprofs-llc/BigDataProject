We extracted essential oils from 20 Atractylodes lancea and Atractylodes koreana samples by hydrodistillation. The variation in extraction yields (1.33-4.06%) suggested that contents of the essential oils differed between species. The volatile components (atractylon, atractydin, and atractylenolide I, II, and III) were quantified by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection and confirmed by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry, and the results demonstrated that the number and content of volatile components differed between A. lancea and A. koreana. We then calculated the relative peak areas of common components and similarities of samples by comparing the chromatograms of A. lancea and A. koreana extracts. Also, we employed several chemometric techniques, including similarity analysis, hierarchical clustering analysis, principal component analysis, and partial least-squares discriminate analysis, to analyze the samples. Results were consistent across analytical methods and showed that samples could be separated according to species. Five volatile components in the essential oils were quantified to further validate the results of the multivariate statistical analysis. The method is simple, stable, accurate, and reproducible. Our results provide a foundation for quality control analysis of A. lancea and A. koreana. This article is protected by copyright.
