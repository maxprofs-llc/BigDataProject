Laparoscopy is the gold standard diagnostic test for endometriosis, but is expensive and carries surgical risks. Currently, there are no non-invasive or minimally invasive tests available in clinical practice to accurately diagnose endometriosis. Although other reviews have assessed the ability of blood tests to diagnose endometriosis, this is the first review to use Cochrane methods, providing an update on the rapidly expanding literature in this field.\nTo evaluate blood biomarkers as replacement tests for diagnostic surgery and as triage tests to inform decisions on surgery for endometriosis. Specific objectives include:1. To provide summary estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of blood biomarkers for the diagnosis of peritoneal, ovarian and deep infiltrating pelvic endometriosis, compared to surgical diagnosis as a reference standard.2. To assess the diagnostic utility of biomarkers that could differentiate ovarian endometrioma from other ovarian masses.\nWe did not restrict the searches to particular study designs, language or publication dates. We searched CENTRAL to July 2015, MEDLINE and EMBASE to May 2015, as well as these databases to 20 April 2015: CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, LILACS, OAIster, TRIP, ClinicalTrials.gov, DARE and PubMed.\nWe considered published, peer-reviewed, randomised controlled or cross-sectional studies of any size, including prospectively collected samples from any population of reproductive-aged women suspected of having one or more of the following target conditions: ovarian, peritoneal or deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE). We included studies comparing the diagnostic test accuracy of one or more blood biomarkers with the findings of surgical visualisation of endometriotic lesions.\nTwo authors independently collected and performed a quality assessment of data from each study. For each diagnostic test, we classified the data as positive or negative for the surgical detection of endometriosis, and we calculated sensitivity and specificity estimates. We used the bivariate model to obtain pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity whenever sufficient datasets were available. The predetermined criteria for a clinically useful blood test to replace diagnostic surgery were a sensitivity of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.79 to detect endometriosis. We set the criteria for triage tests at a sensitivity of \u2265 0.95 and a specificity of \u2265 0.50, which 'rules out' the diagnosis with high accuracy if there is a negative test result (SnOUT test), or a sensitivity of \u2265 0.50 and a specificity of \u2265 0.95, which 'rules in' the diagnosis with high accuracy if there is a positive result (SpIN test).\nWe included 141 studies that involved 15,141 participants and evaluated 122 blood biomarkers. All the studies were of poor methodological quality. Studies evaluated the blood biomarkers either in a specific phase of the menstrual cycle or irrespective of the cycle phase, and they tested for them in serum, plasma or whole blood. Included women were a selected population with a high frequency of endometriosis (10% to 85%), in which surgery was indicated for endometriosis, infertility work-up or ovarian mass. Seventy studies evaluated the diagnostic performance of 47 blood biomarkers for endometriosis (44 single-marker tests and 30 combined tests of two to six blood biomarkers). These were angiogenesis\/growth factors, apoptosis markers, cell adhesion molecules, high-throughput markers, hormonal markers, immune system\/inflammatory markers, oxidative stress markers, microRNAs, tumour markers and other proteins. Most of these biomarkers were assessed in small individual studies, often using different cut-off thresholds, and we could only perform meta-analyses on the data sets for anti-endometrial antibodies, interleukin-6 (IL-6), cancer antigen-19.9 (CA-19.9) and CA-125. Diagnostic estimates varied significantly between studies for each of these biomarkers, and CA-125 was the only marker with sufficient data to reliably assess sources of heterogeneity.The mean sensitivities and specificities of anti-endometrial antibodies (4 studies, 759 women) were 0.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 0.87) and 0.75 (95% CI 0.46 to 1.00). For IL-6, with a cut-off value of > 1.90 to 2.00 pg\/ml (3 studies, 309 women), sensitivity was 0.63 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.75) and specificity was 0.69 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.82). For CA-19.9, with a cut-off value of > 37.0 IU\/ml (3 studies, 330 women), sensitivity was 0.36 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.45) and specificity was 0.87 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.99).Studies assessed CA-125 at different thresholds, demonstrating the following mean sensitivities and specificities: for cut-off > 10.0 to 14.7 U\/ml: 0.70 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.77) and 0.64 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.82); for cut-off > 16.0 to 17.6 U\/ml: 0.56 (95% CI 0.24, 0.88) and 0.91 (95% CI 0.75, 1.00); for cut-off > 20.0 U\/ml: 0.67 (95% CI 0.50 to 0.85) and 0.69 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.80); for cut-off > 25.0 to 26.0 U\/ml: 0.73 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.79) and 0.70 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.77); for cut-off > 30.0 to 33.0 U\/ml: 0.62 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.79) and 0.76 (95% CI 0.53 to 1.00); and for cut-off > 35.0 to 36.0 U\/ml: 0.40 (95% CI 0.32 to 0.49) and 0.91 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.94).We could not statistically evaluate other biomarkers meaningfully, including biomarkers that were assessed for their ability to differentiate endometrioma from other benign ovarian cysts.Eighty-two studies evaluated 97 biomarkers that did not differentiate women with endometriosis from disease-free controls. Of these, 22 biomarkers demonstrated conflicting results, with some studies showing differential expression and others no evidence of a difference between the endometriosis and control groups.\nOf the biomarkers that were subjected to meta-analysis, none consistently met the criteria for a replacement or triage diagnostic test. A subset of blood biomarkers could prove useful either for detecting pelvic endometriosis or for differentiating ovarian endometrioma from other benign ovarian masses, but there was insufficient evidence to draw meaningful conclusions. Overall, none of the biomarkers displayed enough accuracy to be used clinically outside a research setting. We also identified blood biomarkers that demonstrated no diagnostic value in endometriosis and recommend focusing research resources on evaluating other more clinically useful biomarkers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9123cf058f61000cc8c","authors":["Vicki Nisenblat","Patrick MM Bossuyt","Rabia Shaikh","Cindy Farquhar","Vanessa Jordan","Carola S Scheffers","Ben Willem J Mol","Neil Johnson","M Louise Hull","Nisenblat, Vicki","Bossuyt, Patrick Mm","Shaikh, Rabia","Farquhar, Cindy","Jordan, Vanessa","Scheffers, Carola S","Mol, Ben Willem J","Johnson, Neil","Hull, M Louise","Bossuyt, Patrick MM"],"doi":"10.1002\/14651858.cd012179","first_seen_on":"2016-05-02T03:29:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1465-1858","1469-493X"],"journal":"Cochrane database of systematic reviews","last_mentioned_on":1472518148,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/14651858.CD012179\/full","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27132058?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.cochrane.org\/CD012179\/MENSTR_blood-biomarkers-non-invasive-diagnosis-endometriosis","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/14651858.CD012179#.VyhgyV2fXWY.twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27132058","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/14651858.CD012179#.Vyqv-_o-GDU.twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27132058","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27132058\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27132058\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/14651858.CD012179","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1002\/14651858.cd012179"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/14651858.CD012179\/pdf","pmid":"27132058","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["healthservicesresearch","medicine"],"title":"Blood biomarkers for the non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/blood-biomarkers-noninvasive-diagnosis-endometriosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":18.9,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":18.9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8302052,"mean":6.9984430163018,"rank":458770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7842904,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8302052,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271124,"mean":11.545010921242,"rank":23293,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":247809,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271124,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8573,"mean":18.317075128325,"rank":1930,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":6642,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8573,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184,"mean":27.03349726776,"rank":70,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":16,"researcher":4,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":16,"Scientists":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":5,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"NZ":2,"GB":6,"US":3,"AU":1,"PH":1,"BR":1,"ES":1},"mendeley":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CochraneCGF\/statuses\/726976903517630464","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7107596],"posted_on":"2016-05-02T03:29:35+00:00","author":{"name":"CochraneCGF","url":"http:\/\/mdsg.cochrane.org\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/635664811020283904\/950UUro3_normal.jpg","description":"The Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group is concerned with the systematic evaluation of the management and treatment of menstrual disorders and subfertility","id_on_source":"CochraneCGF","tweeter_id":"931157516","geo":{"lt":-36.85,"ln":174.78333,"country":"NZ"},"followers":387},"tweet_id":"726976903517630464"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jd_wilko\/statuses\/727022182514196480","license":"gnip","rt":["CochraneCGF"],"citation_ids":[7107596],"posted_on":"2016-05-02T06:29:30+00:00","author":{"name":"Jack Wilkinson","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/879104831616503808\/rGjZkL6s_normal.jpg","description":"Applied Medical Statistician.
