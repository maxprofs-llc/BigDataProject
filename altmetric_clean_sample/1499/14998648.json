Up to five target lesions were selected per patient, and FES SUV corrected for background was recorded for each lesion pre-therapy and on-therapy. Complete ER downregulation was defined as \u2265 90% decrease in FES SUV. The effect of prior tamoxifen and fulvestrant therapy on FES SUV was assessed.\nOf 30 patients who underwent paired FES-PET scans, 24 (80%) achieved \u2265 90% decrease in FES avidity, including 1 of 3 patients receiving 200 mg\/day, 2 of 4 patients receiving 400 mg\/day, 14 of 16 patients receiving 600 mg\/day, and 7 of 7 patients receiving 800 mg\/day. Withdrawal of tamoxifen two months prior to FES PET\/CT and withdrawal of fulvestrant six months prior to FES PET\/CT both appeared sufficient to prevent effects on FES SUV. A dosage of 600 mg GDC-0810 per day was selected for phase II in part due to decreases in FES SUV achieved in phase I.\nFES PET\/CT was a useful biomarker of ER occupancy and\/or downregulation in a phase I dose escalation trial of GDC-0810 and helped select the dosage of the ER antagonist\/degrader for phase II trials.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006efa","authors":["Yingbing Wang","Karen Ayres","Debra A Goldman","Maura N.
