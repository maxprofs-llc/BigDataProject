Skin lesion extent in primary cutaneous ALCL was indicative of extracutaneous dissemination development and skin lesion relapse. Neither anaplastic lymphoma kinase expression nor clinical stage affected skin lesion characteristics in secondary cutaneous ALCL. Patients with primary rather than secondary cutaneous ALCL demonstrated better survival outcomes. The skin lesion extent and location on the leg were associated with the tendency toward a poorer prognosis in primary cutaneous ALCL. The secondary cutaneous ALCL prognosis was not influenced by skin lesion characteristics.\nThis was a retrospective study in a single institution.\nSurvival outcomes and prognostic factors in cutaneous ALCL differed by primary tumor site.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e8d","authors":["Lee, Woo Jin","Moon, Ik Jun","Lee, Sang Hyung","Won, Chong Hyun","Chang, Sung Eun","Choi, Jee Ho","Chan Moon, Kee","Park, Chan-Sik","Huh, Jooryung","Lee, Mi Woo","Woo Jin Lee","Ik Jun Moon","Sang Hyung Lee","Chong Hyun Won","Sung Eun Chang","Jee Ho Choi","Kee Chan Moon","Chan-Sik Park","Jooryung Huh","Mi Woo Lee"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jaad.2015.12.053","first_seen_on":"2016-02-22T11:24:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1097-6787","01909622"],"journal":"Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1492165714,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26897385?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26897385?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26897385","pubdate":"2016-02-22T22:00:14+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL): A comparative clinical feature and survival outcome analysis of 52 cases according to primary tumo..","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cutaneous-anaplastic-largecell-lymphoma-alcl-comparative-clinical-feature-survival-outcome-analysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8072166,"mean":6.8521645392475,"rank":4269669,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2238700,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8072166,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":289356,"mean":10.69121285618,"rank":157382,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":101871,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":289356,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3354,"mean":7.6383071875932,"rank":2163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":636,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3354,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99,"mean":11.154836734694,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Other":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/dermatologyf\/statuses\/701727773103038464","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5911761],"posted_on":"2016-02-22T11:18:33+00:00","author":{"name":"dermatologyf","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2046835740\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Dermatology News","id_on_source":"dermatologyf","tweeter_id":"546505902","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":57},"tweet_id":"701727773103038464"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/dermatologyf\/statuses\/852830936072724483","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5911761],"posted_on":"2017-04-14T10:28:34+00:00","author":{"name":"dermatologyf","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2046835740\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Dermatology News","id_on_source":"dermatologyf","tweeter_id":"546505902","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":57},"tweet_id":"852830936072724483"}]}}
