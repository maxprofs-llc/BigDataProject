Past literature has reported various hypotheses about the psychopathology of schizophrenia. Recently, a growing literature has been trying to explain the role of inflammation in the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia. In the past, numerous immune modulation and anti-inflammatory treatment options have been proposed for schizophrenia, but sometimes the results were inconsistent. Electronic search was carried out in November 2015. PubMed and Scopus databases have been used to find studies to introduce in this review. Only randomized-placebo-controlled add-on trials were taken into account. In this way, six articles were obtained for the discussion. Celecoxib showed beneficial effects mostly in early stages of schizophrenia. In chronic schizophrenia, the data are controversial, possibly in part for methodological reasons.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5023cf058f61000308f","authors":["Marini, Stefano","De Berardis, Domenico","Vellante, Federica","Santacroce, Rita","Orsolini, Laura","Valchera, Alessandro","Girinelli, Gabriella","Carano, Alessandro","Fornaro, Michele","Gambi, Francesco","Martinotti, Giovanni","Di Giannantonio, Massimo"],"doi":"10.1155\/2016\/3476240","endpage":"8","first_seen_on":"2016-07-25T10:41:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0962-9351","1466-1861"],"journal":"Mediators of Inflammation","last_mentioned_on":1471622531,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/mi\/2016\/3476240\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27524864?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27524864"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/mi\/2016\/3476240.pdf","pmid":"27524864","pubdate":"2016-07-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["pathology","biochemistry"],"title":"Celecoxib Adjunctive Treatment to Antipsychotics in Schizophrenia: A Review of Randomized Clinical Add-On Trials","type":"article","volume":"2016","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/celecoxib-adjunctive-treatment-antipsychotics-schizophrenia-review-randomized-clinical-addon-trials-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8247986,"mean":6.9694821610306,"rank":5964250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1989892,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8247986,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259348,"mean":11.985927949812,"rank":167397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":76521,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259348,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1049,"mean":2.1823282442748,"rank":460,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":537,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1049,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":4.3254545454545,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
