Chronic neck\/shoulder pain was assessed during a follow-up in 1995-1997. A generalized linear model (Poisson regression) was used to calculate adjusted relative risks (RRs).\nWork stress was dosedependently associated with the risk of neck\/shoulder pain (ptrend < 0.001 in both sexes). The women and men who perceived their work as stressful \"almost all the time\" had multi-adjusted RRs = 1.27 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-1.47) and 1.71 (95% CI: 1.46-2), respectively, referencing those with no stressful work. Work stress interacted with sex (p < 0.001). Poor job control was not associated with the risk of neck\/shoulder pain among the women (RR = 1.04, 95% CI: 0.92-1.19) nor the men (RR = 1.09, 95% CI: 0.95-1.26). Combined analyses showed an inverse dose-dependent association between hours of physical exercise\/week and the risk of neck\/shoulder pain in the men with no stressful work (ptrend = 0.05) and among the men who perceived their work as \"rarely stressful\" (ptrend < 0.02). This effect was not statistically significant among the women or among men with more frequent exposure to work stress.\nWork stress is an independent predictor of chronic neck\/shoulder pain and the effect is stronger in men than in women. Physical exercise does not substantially reduce the risk among the persons with frequent exposure to work stress.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b84","authors":["Fanavoll, Rannveig","Nilsen, Tom Ivar Lund","Holtermann, Andreas","Mork, Paul Jarle","Rannveig Fanavoll","Tom Ivar Lund Nilsen","Andreas Holtermann","Paul Jarle Mork"],"doi":"10.13075\/ijomeh.1896.00606","first_seen_on":"2016-07-25T03:36:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1896-494X","1232-1087"],"issue":"4","journal":"International Journal of Occupational Medicine & Environmental Health (Instytut Medycyny Pracy im.
