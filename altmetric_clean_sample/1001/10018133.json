Early experimenters found that the head is induced during gastrulation by Spemann's organizer. In 1999 we celebrate the 75th anniversary of the discovery of the organizer by Spemann and Mangold, a group of cells in amphibia that secretes powerful signalling molecules. Recently, advances have been made in identifying candidate head inducers. Not surprisingly, these inducers act in familiar molecular pathways, namely transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and WNT signalling.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036ad","authors":["Niehrs, C"],"first_seen_on":"2016-07-25T11:35:00+00:00","issns":["0168-9525"],"issue":"8","journal":"Trends in Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1469446448,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10431193"],"pmid":"10431193","pubdate":"1999-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Head in the WNT: the molecular nature of Spemann's head organizer.","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/head-wnt-molecular-nature-speamanns-head-organizer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082038,"mean":6.8946982576228,"rank":4263705,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2251758,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082038,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257842,"mean":11.950223897673,"rank":141595,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":90513,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257842,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":980,"mean":7.1076792645557,"rank":833,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":87,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":980,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":7.665,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Ph.
