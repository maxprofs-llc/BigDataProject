During this period, one of the most common disorders that frequently arise is represented by depression, that tends to become chronic and may produce many subsequent psychosocial impairments. The present study aimed to analyze characteristics of depressive symptoms in an Italian sample of early adolescents, and to explore their connections with self-esteem levels and perceived maternal and paternal emotional availability.\n594 adolescents (50% females) with a mean age of 12.11 years (SD = 0.98) were administered the Children's Depression Inventory, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and the maternal and the paternal forms of the Lum Emotional Availability of Parents.\nFindings highlighted a slightly higher, though not statistically significant, level of depressive symptoms in girls than in boys. Regression analysis showed that, as far as predictors of depression, self-esteem was the most relevant one, followed by maternal and paternal emotional availability.\nOur results strongly suggested to plan intervention programs aimed at monitoring early adolescents' self-esteem and supporting relationship with both parents, in order to prevent the emergence of depressive symptoms.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc1b","authors":["Babore, Alessandra","Trumello, Carmen","Candelori, Carla","Paciello, Marinella","Cerniglia, Luca"],"doi":"10.3389\/fpsyg.2016.00982","first_seen_on":"2016-07-25T04:05:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1664-1078"],"journal":"Frontiers in Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1469419531,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27445941?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC4923143","pmid":"27445941","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Depressive Symptoms, Self-Esteem and Perceived Parent\u2013Child Relationship in Early Adolescence","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/depressive-symptoms-selfesteem-perceived-parentchild-relationship-early-adolescence-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082038,"mean":6.8946982576228,"rank":6993581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082038,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257842,"mean":11.950453690452,"rank":218027,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257842,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7520,"mean":10.934130336481,"rank":6745,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7520,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":350,"mean":16.666584527221,"rank":307,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":350,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Psychology":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/757426527445266432","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10010369],"posted_on":"2016-07-25T04:05:31+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":981},"tweet_id":"757426527445266432"}]}}
