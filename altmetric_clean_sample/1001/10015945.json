Previous studies have reported that miR-142-3p is a novel mediator of inflammatory signaling pathways, but whether miR-142-3p regulates OA remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential role of miR-142-3p in OA and the underlying molecular mechanism. We showed that miR-142-3p was significantly reduced in the articular cartilage tissues from experimental OA mice. The expression of miR-142-3p was also decreased in chondrocytes treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro. Moreover, the overexpression of miR-142-3p significantly inhibited cell apoptosis, nuclear factor (NF)-kB, and the production of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 induced by LPS. Interestingly, bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), an important inflammatory mediator of OA, was predicted as a target of miR-142-3p, which was validated by dual-luciferase reporter assay. The high expression of HMGB1 in chondrocytes induced by LPS was significantly inhibited by miR-142-3p overexpression. Furthermore, the restoration of HMGB1 markedly abrogated the effect of miR-142-3p. In OA mice, the overexpression of miR-142-3p by lentivirus-mediated gene transfer significantly inhibited HMGB1 expression, NF-kB signaling, and proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, the overexpression of miR-142-3p significantly alleviated OA progression in OA mice in vivo. Taken together, our study suggests that miR-142-3p inhibits chondrocyte apoptosis and inflammation in OA by inhibiting the HMGB1-mediated NF-kB signaling pathway. The overexpression of miR-142-3p impedes the OA progression in mice in vivo indicating that miR-142-3p is a potential molecular target for OA treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ac7","authors":["Wang, Xiuqin","Guo, Yanqing","Wang, Chunyan","Yu, Hong","Yu, Xiuxiang","Yu, Hongbo"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10753-016-0406-3","first_seen_on":"2016-07-25T09:21:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-2576","0360-3997"],"journal":"Inflammation","last_mentioned_on":1469438408,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27447821?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27447821","pubdate":"2016-07-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pathology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology\/Toxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Rheumatology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["pathology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"MicroRNA-142-3p Inhibits Chondrocyte Apoptosis and Inflammation in Osteoarthritis by Targeting HMGB1","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microrna1423p-inhibits-chondrocyte-apoptosis-inflammation-osteoarthritis-targeting-hmgb1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082038,"mean":6.8946982576228,"rank":6993550,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082038,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257841,"mean":11.950343546385,"rank":218004,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257841,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":461,"mean":1.5081608695652,"rank":255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":461,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":1.0875,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
