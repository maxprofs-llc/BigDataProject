This is necessary to reduce the risk of complications related to surgical procedures performed in the area due to vascular, metabolic, or traumatic causes. It is of importance for achieving the alignment of the prosthesis to be implanted as well. The aim of this study was to evaluate the morphometric characteristics of the proximal femur and to establish a database for making and performing total hip prosthesis. Anteroposterior (AP) pelvic radiographs of 162 cases, with a mean age of 65.6 years, who had undergone unilateral total hip arthroplasty were used in this study. Femoral head diameter (FHD), femoral neck width (FNW), femoral neck length (FNL), femoral neck axis length (FNAL), intertrochanteric line length (ILL), and neck-shaft angle (NSA) were measured on radiographs obtained digitally using setrapacs media. FHD was found to be 48.1\u2009\u00b1\u20093.7 mm, FNW 35.4\u2009\u00b1\u20094.2 mm, FNL 30.8\u2009\u00b1\u20096.1 mm, FNAL 98.6\u2009\u00b1\u20099.4 mm, ILL 81.1\u2009\u00b1\u20097.9 mm, and NSA 130.4\u2009\u00b1\u20095.1\u00b0 on average. The comparison of the mean values for females and males revealed a statistically significant difference between the FHD, FNW, FNL, FNAL, and ILL (P\u2009=\u20090.000). There was no statistically significant difference in NSA between males and females (P\u2009=\u20090.356). A weak correlation was found between age and parameter values using correlation analysis (r\u2009<\u20090.24, P\u2009>\u20090.05). In morphometric assessment of the proximal femur, taking into consideration regional and sexual differences is of importance for prosthesis design and surgical success.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006eef","authors":["\u0130yem, C\u0130han","G\u00fcven\u00e7er, Mustafa","Karatosun, Vasf\u0130","\u00dcnver, Bayram"],"doi":"10.1002\/ca.22245","endpage":"488","first_seen_on":"2013-05-06T05:25:44+00:00","issns":["1098-2353","0897-3806"],"issue":"3","journal":"Clinical Anatomy","last_mentioned_on":1367817778,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ca.22245\/abstract;jsessionid=E0713504157D301F3DFAADE5D324CBB1.d02t03?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+on+11+May+from+10%3A00-12%3A00+BST+%2805%3A00-07%3A00+EDT%29+for+essential+maintenance"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ca.22245\/pdf","pmid":"23650122","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley-Liss Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"478","subjects":["anatomy"],"title":"Morphometric evaluation of proximal femur in patients with unilateral total hip prosthesis","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/morphometric-evaluation-proximal-femur-patients-unilateral-total-hip-prosthesis-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6638946,"mean":6.1503669423349,"rank":4911865,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":974320,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6638946,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100977,"mean":7.2310158057361,"rank":68109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":18106,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100977,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":453,"mean":8.0220132743363,"rank":292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":63,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":453,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":2.0625,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
