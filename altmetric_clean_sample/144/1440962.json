This article reports the successful achievement of this goal. Using previously rehearsed alkylating agents, students in a second semester organic chemistry laboratory performed a solid-phase combinatorial chemistry experiment in which they made 38 new analogs of the most potent member of a class of antimelanoma compounds. All compounds were made in duplicate, purified by silica gel chromatography, and characterized by NMR and LC\/MS. As a continuing part of the Distributed Drug Discovery program, a virtual D(3) catalog based on this work was then enumerated and is made freely available to the global scientific community.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d16","authors":["William L.
