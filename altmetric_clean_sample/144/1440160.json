A mechanism involving a formal Cu(II) to Cu(0) route by convergent disproportionation of the copper mediator is proposed and has been evidenced by copper mirror formation during the reaction. This synthetic protocol provides a concise and \"green\" access to unsymmetrical biheteroarenes bearing structural motifs of substantial utility in organic synthesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003265","authors":["Zhifeng Mao"],"doi":"10.1021\/ol301517y","first_seen_on":"2013-05-05T11:52:56+00:00","issns":["1523-7060"],"journal":"Organic Letters","last_mentioned_on":1342719000,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ol301517y"],"pmid":"22794302","pubdate":"2012-07-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Copper(II)-Mediated Dehydrogenative Cross-Coupling of Heteroarenes","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/copperiimediated-dehydrogenative-crosscoupling-heteroarenes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.624,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.624},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3686760,"mean":4.9542254316086,"rank":535602,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":3150607,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3686760,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85289,"mean":6.8061624613075,"rank":15297,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":69988,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85289,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2383,"mean":3.4544920235097,"rank":534,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":1781,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2383,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159,"mean":4.2472151898734,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":135,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
