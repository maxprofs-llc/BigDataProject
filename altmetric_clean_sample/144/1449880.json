Visual inspection after application of dilute acetic acid on the cervix (VIA) has not been adequately studied against the current standard: conventional cervical cytology (Pap smears) among HIV-infected women. We evaluated 303 nonpregnant HIV-infected women in Pune, India, by simultaneous and independent screening with VIA and cervical cytology with disease ascertainment by colposcopy and histopathology. At the cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2+) disease threshold, the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive value estimates of VIA were 80, 82.6, 47.6 and 95.4% respectively, compared to 60.5, 59.6, 22.4 and 88.7% for the atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or severe (ASCUS+) cutoff on cytology, 60.5, 64.6, 24.8 and 89.4% for the low-grade squamous intraepithelial cells or severe (LSIL+) cutoff on cytology and 20.9, 96.0, 50.0 and 86.3% for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or severe (HSIL+) cutoff on cytology. A similar pattern of results was found for women with the presence of carcinogenic HPV-positive CIN2+ disease, as well as for women with CD4+ cell counts <200 and <350 \u03bcL(-1) . Overall, VIA performed better than cytology in this study with biologically rigorous endpoints and without verification bias, suggesting that VIA is a practical and useful alternative or adjunctive screening test for HIV-infected women. Implementing VIA-based screening within HIV\/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome care programs may provide an easy and practical means of complementing the highly anticipated low-cost HPV-based rapid screening tests in the near future, thereby contributing to improve program effectiveness of screening.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61d3cf058f610007841","authors":["Sahasrabuddhe, Vikrant V.","Bhosale, Ramesh A.","Kavatkar, Anita N.","Nagwanshi, Chandraprabha A.","Joshi, Smita N.","Jenkins, Cathy A.","Shepherd, Bryan E.","Kelkar, Rohini S.","Sahay, Seema","Risbud, Arun R.","Vermund, Sten H.","Mehendale, Sanjay M."],"doi":"10.1002\/ijc.25971","endpage":"240","first_seen_on":"2013-05-06T14:18:59+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1097-0215","0020-7136","00207136"],"issue":"1","journal":"International Journal of Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1388534400,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ijc.25971\/abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/ijc.25971"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ijc.25971\/pdf","pmid":"21387289","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"234","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Comparison of visual inspection with acetic acid and cervical cytology to detect high\u2010grade cervical neoplasia among HIV\u2010infected women in India","type":"article","volume":"130","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-visual-inspection-acetic-acid-cervical-cytology-detect-highgrade-cervical-neoplasia-among"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.264,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.264},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082038,"mean":6.8946982576228,"rank":1016558,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7065707,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082038,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120182,"mean":6.9728993934151,"rank":16480,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":103701,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120182,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4167,"mean":6.0500326452232,"rank":487,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":3681,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4167,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":6.3808421052632,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":4,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
