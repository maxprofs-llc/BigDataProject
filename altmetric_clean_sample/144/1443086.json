A central computational problem on reticulate networks is: given a set of phylogenetic trees (each for some region of the genomes), reconstruct the most parsimonious reticulate network (called the minimum reticulate network) that combines the topological information contained in the given trees. This problem is well-known to be NP-hard. Thus, existing approaches for this problem either work with only two input trees or make simplifying topological assumptions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023d2","authors":["Yufeng Wu"],"doi":"10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btq198","first_seen_on":"2013-05-05T19:35:47+00:00","issns":["1460-2059"],"journal":"Bioinformatics","last_mentioned_on":1337119680,"links":["http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/26\/12\/i140.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/26\/12\/i140.full.pdf","pmid":"20529899","pubdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Mathematics","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Close lower and upper bounds for the minimum reticulate network of multiple phylogenetic trees","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/close-lower-upper-bounds-minimum-reticulate-network-multiple-phylogenetic-trees"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.368,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.368},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628259,"mean":4.9430875566221,"rank":551340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":3076475,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628259,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84920,"mean":6.8291187602305,"rank":15667,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":69244,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84920,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3705,"mean":5.1314265658747,"rank":1016,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":2688,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3705,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":3.0666666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
