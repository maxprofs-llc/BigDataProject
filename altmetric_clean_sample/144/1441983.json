A 47-year-old woman developed right sensory neural hearing loss followed, 2 months later, by right facial palsy. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed features of pachymeningitis and pituitary gland infiltration. The diagnosis of primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome was confirmed by demonstrating positive SS-A and SS-B antibodies and histological evidence of lymphocytic infiltration of the sublabial salivary gland. During the 2-year follow-up, the patient had transient VI(th), IX(th), X(th), and XII(th) cranial nerve palsies. Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with multiple recurrent cranial nerve palsies, even if prominent sicca symptoms are absent.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51b3cf058f6100038cd","authors":["V.
