The physical properties of helium enable an easier gas flow through the airways; this enables easier breathing for the patient when compared to standard ventilation of air. A high cost of heliox falls within the factors that limit the use of heliox in clinical practice. At present, heliox is administered by use of an open circuit. The aim of this study is to propose a way of heliox administration that reduces heliox consumption but does not affect the positive heliox effects upon the airway resistance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008e13","authors":["Roub\u00edk K","Zazula R","Strnadov\u00e1 A","Z\u00e1brodsk\u00fd V","Sp\u00e1len\u00fd A","M\u00fcller M","Chlumsk\u00fd J","Tyll T"],"doi":"10.5301\/ijao.5000088","first_seen_on":"2013-05-05T13:59:04+00:00","issns":["0391-3988"],"issue":"","journal":"International Journal of Artificial Organs","last_mentioned_on":1367762183,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22466996?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22466996","pubdate":"2012-04-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Spontaneous breathing of heliox using a semi-closed circuit: A bench study.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/spontaneous-breathing-heliox-using-semiclosed-circuit-bench-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627218,"mean":4.9497513377373,"rank":2906647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":73710,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627218,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84925,"mean":6.8350358909143,"rank":66345,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":221,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84925,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":1.570575,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.625,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
