Significantly fewer male role models were found in the family backgrounds of the severely gender-disturbed boys as compared to the mild-to-moderately gender-disturbed boys. Male childhood gender disturbance was also found to be correlated with a high incidence of psychiatric problems in both the mothers and fathers and with atypical patterns of the boys' involvement with their mothers and fathers, as measured by the Bene-Anthony Family Relations Test and the Rekers Behavior Checklist for Childhood Gender Problems.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d83cf058f61000138a","first_seen_on":"2013-05-06T07:27:53+00:00","issns":["0022-1325"],"issue":"1st Half","journal":"The Journal of Genetic Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1279746538,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/6854278"],"pmid":"6854278","pubdate":"1983-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences","psychology","genetics"],"title":"Family correlates of male childhood gender disturbance.","type":"article","volume":"142","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/family-correlates-male-childhood-gender-disturbance"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.32,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.32},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685110,"mean":4.9408620385482,"rank":562922,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":3122466,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685110,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85204,"mean":6.8065623276175,"rank":15858,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":69345,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85204,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":2.7528936170213,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":76,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":3.3333333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":2,"Computer Science":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Cleaning the Closets of Medicine","url":"http:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/blog\/fetishes-i-dont-get\/201007\/cleaning-the-closets-medicine","license":"public","citation_ids":[1447962,1447963,1447964],"posted_on":"2010-07-21T21:08:58+00:00","summary":"","author":{"name":"Fetishes I Don&#039;t Get","url":"http:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/blog\/fetishes-i-dont-get\/feed","description":""}}]}}
