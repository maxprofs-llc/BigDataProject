Neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets, which are small in size but produce strong magnetic fields, have become widely available in recent years. Therefore, NdFeB magnets may be associated with an emerging risk of device interference.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61a3cf058f610007602","authors":["Wolber T","Ryf S","Binggeli C","Holzmeister J","Brunckhorst C","Luechinger R","Duru F"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.hrthm.2006.09.012","endpage":"4","first_seen_on":"2013-05-05T22:35:20+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1547-5271","15475271"],"issue":"1","journal":"Heart Rhythm","last_mentioned_on":1350601589,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17198980"],"pmid":"17198980","pubdate":"2007-01-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Potential interference of small neodymium magnets with cardiac pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators.","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/potential-interference-small-neodymium-magnets-cardiac-pacemakers-implantable-cardioverterdefibrilla"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.736,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.736},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685988,"mean":4.9540738657005,"rank":206236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":3479778,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685988,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85287,"mean":6.8037892737377,"rank":7157,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":78130,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85287,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":399,"mean":4.4359698492462,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":372,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":399,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.85,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Could a Bra Interact With a Pacemaker or Defibrillator?","url":"http:\/\/feedproxy.google.com\/~r\/blogspot\/TuRAx\/~3\/49IGOfe3K6k\/could-bra-interact-with-pacemaker-or.html","license":"public","citation_ids":[1444519],"posted_on":"2011-01-04T12:53:00+00:00","summary":"The comment was posted on this blog earlier:\"I was reading one of your old posts about magnets and I was wondering if a magnetic front closure on a bra would be a problem?
