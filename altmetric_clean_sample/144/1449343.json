The aldosterone\/plasma renin activity ratio (ARR) is routinely used as a screening test. Antihypertensive therapy can interfere with the interpretation of this parameter, but a correct washout period can be potentially harmful. We have investigated the effects of therapy with atenolol, amlodipine, doxazosin, fosinopril, and irbesartan on the ARR in a group of 230 patients with suspected primary aldosteronism. The percent change from control of ARR in patients taking amlodipine was -17%+\/-32; atenolol, 62%+\/-82; doxazosin, -5%+\/-26; fosinopril, -30%+\/-24; and irbesartan, -43%+\/-27. The ARR change induced by atenolol was significantly higher compared with that induced by all other drugs (P<0.0001), and the ARR change induced by irbesartan was significantly lower than that induced by doxazosin (P<0.0001). One of 55 patients from the group taking amlodipine (1.8%) and 4\/17 of the patients taking irbesartan (23.5%) gave a false-negative ARR (<50). None of the patients of the groups taking fosinopril, doxazosin, and atenolol displayed a false-negative ARR. Doxazosin and fosinopril can be used in hypertensive patients who need to undergo aldosterone and PRA measurement for the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism; amlodipine gave a very small percentage of false-negative diagnoses. beta-Blockers also do not interfere with the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism, but they can be responsible for an increased rate of false-positive ARRs. The high rate of false-negative diagnoses in patients undergoing irbesartan treatment requires confirmation in a higher number of patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f610007693","authors":["Mulatero, Paolo","Rabbia, Franco","Milan, Alberto","Paglieri, Cristina","Morello, Fulvio","Chiandussi, Livio","Veglio, Franco"],"first_seen_on":"2013-05-06T13:09:33+00:00","issns":["1524-4563"],"issue":"6","journal":"Hypertension (Highwire)","last_mentioned_on":1296640800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12468576"],"pmid":"12468576","pubdate":"2002-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Drug effects on aldosterone\/plasma renin activity ratio in primary aldosteronism.","type":"article","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/drug-effects-aldosteroneplasma-renin-activity-ratio-primary-aldosteronism"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.072,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.072},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3636227,"mean":4.9205935445202,"rank":584353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":3050848,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3636227,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84953,"mean":6.8159587531784,"rank":16395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":68549,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84953,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2038,"mean":3.9987039764359,"rank":254,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":1778,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2038,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":4.315625,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
