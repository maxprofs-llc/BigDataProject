We inhibited the expression of TKTL1 by RNAi in HepG2 cells. It was found that total transketolase activity was dramatically downregulated and the proliferation of cancer cells was significantly inhibited in HepG2 cells. These results indicate that TKTL1 gene influences total transketolase activity and cell proliferation in human hepatoma cells, suggesting that TKTL1 gene plays an important role on glycometabolism in tumors and it might become a novel target for tumor gene therapy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000249e","doi":"10.1016\/j.canlet.2007.01.010","first_seen_on":"2013-05-06T07:03:52+00:00","issns":["0304-3835"],"journal":"Cancer Letters","last_mentioned_on":1290436239,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T54-4N440GR-2&_user=10&_coverDate=08%2F08%2F2007&_rdoc=13&_fmt=high&_orig=browse&_origin=browse&_zone=rslt_list_item&_srch=doc-info%28%23toc%234992%232007%23997469998%23660500%23FLA%23display%23Volume%29&_cdi=4992&_sort=d&_docanchor=&_ct=18&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=37650abd29f54fc3e331b0e9a7366572&searchtype=a","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.canlet.2007.01.010","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17321041"],"pmid":"17321041","pubdate":"2007-02-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Gene silencing of TKTL1 by RNAi inhibits cell proliferation in human hepatoma cells.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gene-silencing-tktl1-rnai-inhibits-cell-proliferation-human-hepatoma-cells-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629051,"mean":4.9368884016521,"rank":234412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":3388924,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629051,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84856,"mean":6.830152778269,"rank":8064,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":76703,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84856,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":861,"mean":2.1701395348837,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":843,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":861,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.7,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
