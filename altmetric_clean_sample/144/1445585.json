It is shown that there is a first-order property, Q(X), definable in E, the lattice of r.e. sets under inclusion, such that (i) if A is any r.e. set satisfying Q(A) then A is nonrecursive and Turing incomplete and (ii) there exists an r.e. set A satisfying Q(A). This resolves a long open question stemming from Post's program of 1944, and it sheds light on the fundamental problem of the relationship between the algebraic structure of an r.e. set A and the (Turing) degree of information that A encodes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["L Harrington","R I Soare"],"first_seen_on":"2013-05-06T03:07:04+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1091-6490","0027-8424"],"issue":"22","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1271678430,"links":["http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/88\/22\/10242.full.pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/88\/22\/10242.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC52904","pmid":"11607241","pubdate":"1991-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Acad Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Post's program and incomplete recursively enumerable sets","type":"article","volume":"88","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/posts-program-incomplete-recursively-enumerable-sets"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3622349,"mean":4.9308753696201,"rank":328738,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":3259917,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3622349,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84658,"mean":6.8413472246832,"rank":10561,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":73746,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84658,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33565,"mean":13.674104576332,"rank":7706,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":25510,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33565,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":923,"mean":23.740778741866,"rank":407,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":513,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":923,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1,"Post Doc":2,"Ph.D. Student":1,"Researcher (at a non-Academic Institution)":1,"Student (Postgraduate)":1},"by_discipline":{"Education":1,"Computer and Information Science":2,"Mathematics":3}}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"A Post on Post","url":"http:\/\/rjlipton.wordpress.com\/2010\/04\/19\/a-post-on-post\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[1445585,1445586],"posted_on":"2010-04-19T12:00:30+00:00","summary":"Emil Post role in shaping modern computational theory \n\n\n\nEmil Post was one of founders of the modern theory of computation.
