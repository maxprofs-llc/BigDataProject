However, the negative effects on rumen function and distribution of trace elements in tissues induced by excessive Mo have not been well understood. Therefore, the purpose of present study was to investigate the impact of Mo on rumen microbiota, distribution of trace elements in various organs, and hematological parameters of goats. A total of 36 goats were randomly distributed into three groups with equal number and low-Mo and high-Mo groups were orally administered ammonium molybdate at 15 and 45\u00a0mg\u2009\u00b7\u2009Mo\u2009\u00b7\u2009kg(-1)\u2009\u00b7\u2009BW respectively, while the control group received corresponding quantitative deionized water. The results showed that the total number of ciliate and protozoa protein concentration decreased significantly (P\u2009<\u20090.01) on days 25 and 50. Concentrations of ammonia nitrogen and bacterial protein were significantly higher (P\u2009<\u20090.05) in low-Mo group, while they were lower (P\u2009<\u20090.05) in high-Mo group than the control group on days 25 and 50. In addition, Mo accumulated in serum and all detected tissues. Copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) contents significantly decreased (P\u2009<\u20090.05) in hair and serum on days 25 and 50, while Cu contents increased (P\u2009<\u20090.05) and the change of Zn contents were not obvious (P\u2009>\u20090.05) in other tissues on days 25 and 50. Besides, there was no obvious variation in iron (Fe) contents during whole experiment period (P\u2009>\u20090.05). Furthermore, excessive Mo content had no significant effect on red blood cell (RBC) counts and hemoglobin (HGB) concentration (P\u2009>\u20090.05) on days 25 and 50, while white blood cell (WBC) counts increased significantly (P\u2009<\u20090.05) on day 50. These results indicated that excessive Mo content could impact the balance of ruminal microorganisms and interfere with the absorption and distribution of Mo and Cu mainly.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c68","authors":["Zhou, Sihui","Zhang, Caiying","Xiao, Qingyang","Zhuang, Yu","Gu, Xiaolong","Yang, Fan","Xing, Chenghong","Hu, Guoliang","Cao, Huabin"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12011-016-0706-3","first_seen_on":"2016-05-09T03:32:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1559-0720","0163-4984"],"journal":"Biological Trace Element Research","last_mentioned_on":1462530970,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27147434?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27147434","pubdate":"2016-05-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nutrition","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Effects of Different Levels of Molybdenum on Rumen Microbiota and Trace Elements Changes in Tissues from Goats","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-different-levels-molybdenum-rumen-microbiota-trace-elements-changes-tissues-goats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7659635,"mean":6.5812991774756,"rank":5793728,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1031499,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7659635,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266663,"mean":11.41768746953,"rank":186673,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":43774,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266663,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":853,"mean":2.8452276995305,"rank":572,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":189,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":853,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":0.83,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
