The application of continuous flow technology allowed for the controlled generation of difluorocarbene from TMSCF3 and a catalytic quantity of NaI. The in situ generated electrophilic carbene reacts smoothly with a broad range of alkenes and alkynes, allowing the synthesis of the corresponding difluorocyclopropanes and difluorocyclopropenes. The reaction is complete within a 10 min residence time at high reaction concentrations. With a production flow rate of 1 mmol\/min, continuous flow chemistry enables scale up of this process in a green, atom-economic, and safe manner.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003265","authors":["Pauline Rulli\u00e8re"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.orglett.6b00573","endpage":"1991","first_seen_on":"2016-05-09T07:18:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1523-7052","1523-7060"],"issue":"9","journal":"Organic Letters","last_mentioned_on":1462560550,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.orglett.6b00573"],"pmid":"27119573","pubdate":"2016-05-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1988","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Difluorocarbene Addition to Alkenes and Alkynes in Continuous Flow","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/difluorocarbene-addition-alkenes-alkynes-continuous-flow"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7659635,"mean":6.5812991774756,"rank":3314256,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4259184,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7659635,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266663,"mean":11.417524904185,"rank":111506,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":151205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266663,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3696,"mean":3.3704070365359,"rank":1646,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":1975,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3696,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":129,"mean":5.772234375,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":75,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":129,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
