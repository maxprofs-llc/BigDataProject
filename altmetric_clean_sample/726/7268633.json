From a pharmacovigilance perspective, capturing and making the best use of this information remains a challenge. The Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb received about 1800 reports after the packaging of the drug Thyrax(\u00ae) (levothyroxine; Aspen Pharma Trading Limited, Dublin, Ireland) changed from a brown glass bottle to a blister package in the Netherlands.\nThe objective of this study was to explore the impact of ADRs on HR-QOL in patients who reported a possible ADR to Lareb in relation to the change in the packaging of the drug Thyrax(\u00ae). A secondary objective was to explore factors correlated with change in HR-QOL.\nPatients who reported an ADR in relation to the Thyrax(\u00ae) packaging change were included in this study. A web-based adapted version of the COOP\/WONCA questionnaire was sent to explore the HR-QOL before versus during the ADR, expressed on a 5-point scale from no impact (1) to high impact (5). Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to identify factors correlated with change in HR-QOL.\nOverall, 1167 patients returned the questionnaire (71.2\u00a0% response rate). The difference in HR-QOL was -0.8 for physical, -1.2 for mental, -1.4 for daily activities, -1.3 for social, and -1.3 for overall health status (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 for each domain). Age, sex, educational level of the patient, and absence from work due to an ADR were correlated with at least one domain, while severity of the ADR was found to be correlated with all domains of HR-QOL.\nPatients who reported possible ADRs after the Thyrax(\u00ae) packaging change experienced a significant decrease in HR-QOL. This impact was highest for the domains 'daily activities', 'overall health status', and 'mental health' and lowest for 'physical fitness'.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002737","authors":["Le\u00e0n Rolfes","Florence Hunsel","Katja Taxis","Eug\u00e8ne Puijenbroek","Rolfes, Le\u00e0n","van Hunsel, Florence","Taxis, Katja","van Puijenbroek, Eug\u00e8ne","Florence van Hunsel","Eug\u00e8ne van Puijenbroek"],"doi":"10.1007\/s40264-016-0422-0","endpage":"776","first_seen_on":"2016-05-09T07:38:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0114-5916","1179-1942"],"issue":"8","journal":"Drug Safety","last_mentioned_on":1464906600,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs40264-016-0422-0","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s40264-016-0422-0"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs40264-016-0422-0.pdf","pmid":"27145946","pubdate":"2016-05-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology\/Toxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"769","subjects":["drugtherapy"],"title":"The Impact of Experiencing Adverse Drug Reactions on the Patient\u2019s Quality of Life: A Retrospective Cross-Sectional Study in the Netherlands","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s40264-016-0422-0","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-experiencing-adverse-drug-reactions-patients-quality-life-retrospective-crosssectional-study-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.08,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7847043,"mean":6.6493042501824,"rank":854463,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":6991407,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7847043,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267843,"mean":11.436283794177,"rank":44270,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":223417,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267843,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":834,"mean":4.9014669867947,"rank":89,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":745,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":834,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":4.790625,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
