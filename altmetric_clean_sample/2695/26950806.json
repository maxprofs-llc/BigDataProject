The dataset GSE53482 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) of peripheral blood (PB) cluster of differentiation (CD)34(+) cells from PMF patients (PB-PMF group) and peripheral blood CD34(+) cells from healthy individuals (PB-control group) were analyzed using the Linear Models for Microarray Data package in R. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes was used for pathway enrichment analysis. MiRNA-gene joint enrichment analysis was performed by ENViz and a miRNAs-gene regulatory network was constructed. A total of 1,182 DEGs (773 upregulated and 109 downregulated) and 48 DEMs (28 upregulated and 20 downregulated) were identified. According to the pathway enrichment analysis, a number of DEGs were enriched in metabolic pathways, including IDH1 and DNMT1. Other DEGs were enriched in the citrate cycle (tricarboxylic acid cycle; IDH1 and IDH3A) and certain DEGs were enriched in pyrimidine metabolism, including CARD8. For downregulated genes, certain DEGs were enriched in the spliceosome, including SF3B1 and CDC40. Furthermore, hsa-miR-127-3p, hsa-miR-140-3p and hsa-miR345 were associated with cell cycle-related biological processes, signal transduction and cell surface receptor signaling pathway. The DEM-DEG regulatory network indicated that hsa-miR-543 regulated 113 genes, including CARD8 and TIFA. The present study identified a number of genes, including IDH1, DNMT1, SF3B1 and CARD8, and miRNAs, including hsa-miR-127-3p and hsa-miR-140-3p, which may be therapeutic targets in the treatment of PMF.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073b6","authors":["Yong Liu","Bo Wei","Xuebing Zhang","Dehui Xu","Bo Wang","Guochao Yin","Dawer Gu","Yuxiang Li","Daliang Kong"],"doi":"10.3892\/etm.2017.4912","first_seen_on":"2017-10-03T10:10:26+00:00","issns":["1792-0981","1792-1015"],"issue":"4","journal":"Experimental and Therapeutic Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1507025411,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28966666?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC5615205","pmid":"28966666","pubdate":"2017-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Identification of potential therapeutic target genes and miRNAs for primary myelofibrosis with microarray analysis","type":"article","volume":"14"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0.25,"6d":0.25,"5d":0.25,"4d":0.25,"3d":0.25,"2d":0.25,"1d":0.25,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8463828,"mean":7.1089465141397,"rank":7313094,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8463828,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103683,"mean":11.144315464594,"rank":83835,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103683,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":936,"mean":1.4838887700535,"rank":492,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":936,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":0.50568181818182,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/skim_lab\/statuses\/915157020600188928","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26950806],"posted_on":"2017-10-03T10:10:11+00:00","author":{"name":"BiocomputingLab@TGen","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"skim_lab","tweeter_id":"2806820977","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":29},"tweet_id":"915157020600188928"}]}}
