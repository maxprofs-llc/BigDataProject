For elucidating the function of biomolecules, peptides are powerful tools, compared to native proteins, because of their lower molecular weights, compatibility with chemical modification, and predictability of interaction with the target molecules. These advantages enabled us to develop peptide-based functional molecules. However, for the purposes of controlling or regulating biomolecule functions, designing artificial proteins is also an effective approach. Not only rational protein design, but also directed molecular evolution, are now regarded as powerful methods for optimizing protein function. The interactions of proteins with bio-macromolecules are usually highly specific and show high affinity because of larger interaction surfaces as compared to small molecules or peptides. Thus, the use of proteins for designing biofunctional molecules is also important for wider applications in the biotechnology field. In this review, four topics will be discussed: 1) the development of fluorescently-labeled ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), as well as bivalent ligands for GPCR imaging and function analysis, 2) the design and synthesis of gp41 trimer mimics as HIV-1 inhibitors or vaccines, 3) the development of a ZIP tag-probe system and its application to intracellular protein imaging, and 4) the functional analysis of sequence-specific DNA recombinase for expanding the scope of genome editing. The results of these studies indicate the importance of precision in the design of peptides or proteins for regulating bio-macromolecular interactions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d2e","authors":["Wataru Nomura"],"doi":"10.1248\/yakushi.17-00125","first_seen_on":"2017-10-03T12:03:28+00:00","issns":["0031-6903","1347-5231"],"issue":"10","journal":"Yakugaku Zasshi = Journal of Pharmaceutical Society of Japan","last_mentioned_on":1507032193,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28966263?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28966263","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacy","pharmacology"],"title":"Creation of Functional Molecules Based on Biomolecular Interactions; Development toward Chemical Biology","type":"article","volume":"137"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0.25,"6d":0.25,"5d":0.25,"4d":0.25,"3d":0.25,"2d":0.25,"1d":0.25,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8464649,"mean":7.1091103438598,"rank":7313662,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8464649,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103991,"mean":11.151139628811,"rank":84107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103991,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":586,"mean":2.1080444444444,"rank":462,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":586,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.925,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/camglyco\/statuses\/915185467078754304","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26955663],"posted_on":"2017-10-03T12:03:13+00:00","author":{"name":"CamGlycoscience","url":"http:\/\/camglyco.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/819687021732040706\/xl7Kg5aF_normal.jpg","description":"Tweeting the latest science about #sugars, #carbohydrates, #CAZymes, etc.","id_on_source":"camglyco","tweeter_id":"819673058885664768","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":267},"tweet_id":"915185467078754304"}]}}
