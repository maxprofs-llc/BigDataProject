Migraine imparts substantial suffering to the family in addition to the sufferer, particularly as it affects three times more women than men and is most prevalent between the ages of 25 and 45, the years of child rearing. Migraine typically occurs in individuals with a genetic predisposition and is aggravated by specific environmental triggers. Attempts to study the biochemistry of migraine began as early as the 1960s and were primarily directed at serotonin metabolism after an increase of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), the main metabolite of serotonin was observed in urine of migraineurs. Genetic and biochemical studies have primarily focused on the neurotransmitter serotonin, considering receptor binding, transport and synthesis of serotonin and have investigated serotonergic mediators including enzymes, receptors as well as intermediary metabolites. These studies have been mainly assayed in blood, CSF and urine as the most accessible fluids. More recently PET imaging technology integrated with a metabolomics and a systems biology platform are being applied to study serotonergic biology. The general trend observed is that migraine patients have alterations of neurotransmitter metabolism detected in biological fluids with different biochemistry from controls, however the interpretation of the biological significance of these peripheral changes is unresolved. In this review we present the biology of the serotonergic system and metabolic routes for serotonin and discuss results of biochemical studies with regard to alterations in serotonin in brain, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, platelets, plasma and urine of migraine patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dcd","authors":["Claudia Francesca Gasparini","Robert Anthony Smith","Lyn Robyn Griffiths"],"doi":"10.1186\/s10194-016-0711-0","first_seen_on":"2017-02-24T15:02:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1129-2369","1129-2377"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Headache & Pain","last_mentioned_on":1487948524,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1186\/s10194-016-0711-0"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1186%2Fs10194-016-0711-0.pdf","pmid":"28194570","pubdate":"2017-02-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Milan","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pain Medicine","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","neurology","internalmedicine"],"title":"Genetic and biochemical changes of the serotonergic system in migraine pathobiology","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/thejournalofheadacheandpain.springeropen.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s10194-016-0711-0","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genetic-biochemical-changes-serotonergic-system-migraine-pathobiology"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8266357,"mean":6.977935429341,"rank":6271829,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1117294,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8266357,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242592,"mean":13.668995337832,"rank":177120,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":40359,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242592,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":582,"mean":5.5226092943201,"rank":461,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":71,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":582,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":5.154380952381,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
