Yeast transformed by this plasmid synthesized up to 5 X 10(5) molecules per cell of immunologically active HBsAg polypeptide in phosphate-free medium. The HBsAg polypeptides produced in the yeast cells were assembled into 20- to 22-nm spherical or oval particles and were immunogenic.","ads_id":"1983PNAS...80....1M","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["A Miyanohara","A Toh-e","C Nozaki","F Hamada","N Ohtomo","K Matsubara"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.80.1.1","first_seen_on":"2017-02-24T16:04:05+00:00","issns":["0027-8424","1091-6490"],"issue":"1","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":473385600,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.80.1.1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/80\/1\/1.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC393297","pmid":"6337369","pubdate":"1983-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Acad Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Expression of hepatitis B surface antigen gene in yeast.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/cgi\/doi\/10.1073\/pnas.80.1.1","volume":"80","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expression-hepatitis-b-surface-antigen-gene-yeast-7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7278680,"mean":6.3652431544207,"rank":1730288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4603451,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7278680,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92374,"mean":12.624155305122,"rank":30198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":60389,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92374,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43515,"mean":22.018019855679,"rank":20207,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":14773,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43515,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":551,"mean":42.772585454545,"rank":312,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":210,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":551,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
