Despite its widespread use, no prior study has examined the psychometric validity of the CES-D in assessing depressive pathology in FES. The aim of this study was to examine the psychometric validity of the CES-D in FES. This study involved secondary analysis of baseline data from a single blind, randomized controlled trial of vocational intervention for individuals with FES (N=91; age range: 15-25 years). Measures used were: CES-D, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), and Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR (SCID-I\/P). The CES-D strongly correlated with the depression subscale of the BPRS, and with the presence of full-threshold depressive disorder on the SCID-I\/P. There was minimal overlap between the CES-D and SANS, with weak correlations emerging for avolition and anhedonia, and not for affective flattening, alogia, and attention. The CES-D cut-off of \u226523 produced high sensitivity and specificity values for determining full-threshold comorbid depressive disorder. Such findings indicate that the CES-D is effective for assessing and measuring depressive pathology in FES.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033d2","authors":["Sarah E. Herniman","Kelly A.
