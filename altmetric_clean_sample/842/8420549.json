Moderate activation of RLRs signaling is critical for efficient viral clearance without harmful immunopathology. Estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1) is a member of nuclear receptor and is involved in the regulation of innate immune responses. However, the effects of ER\u03b1 on RLR signaling and the molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we identify ER\u03b1 as a negative regulator of RLR-triggered antiviral immune responses. The expression level of ER\u03b1 is upregulated following RLR activation in macrophages. In the absence of ligand, VSV infection phosphorylates ER\u03b1 at serine 167. ER\u03b1 inhibits VSV-induced IRF3 activation. We further demonstrate that ER\u03b1 directly interacts with TRAF3 and promotes K48-linked proteasomal degradation of TRAF3. Consistently, ER\u03b1 inhibits VSV-triggered IFN-\u03b2 production in macrophages in a ligand independent mechanism. Thus, ER\u03b1 functions as a negative feedback regulator of RLR-triggered antiviral immune responses. These findings also provide the insights that separate the immune effects of ER\u03b1 from its ligand-induced hormonal effects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024cf","authors":["Wang, Changxing","Huang, Yue","Sheng, Jianzhong","Huang, Hefeng","Zhou, Jun"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cellsig.2015.07.008","endpage":"1983","first_seen_on":"2016-06-01T14:52:52+00:00","issns":["1873-3913","08986568"],"issue":"10","journal":"Cellular Signalling","last_mentioned_on":1464792754,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26186972?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26186972","pubdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1977","subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Estrogen receptor alpha inhibits RLR-mediated immune response via ubiquitinating TRAF3","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/estrogen-receptor-alpha-inhibits-rlrmediated-immune-response-via-ubiquitinating-traf3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7842728,"mean":6.6456077751988,"rank":6792739,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7842728,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269347,"mean":11.36503465431,"rank":224393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269347,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":757,"mean":2.0877883597884,"rank":591,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":757,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":1.1673076923077,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
