Mentorship has been shown to improve nurses' understanding and implementation of EBP. In this article, we describe a mentorship model in a successful program to support point-of-care nurses in conducting small-scale research projects, many of which have led to practice changes and\/or cost savings.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e89","authors":["Black, Agnes T.","Bungay, Vicky","Mackay, Martha","Balneaves, Lynda G.","Garossino,
