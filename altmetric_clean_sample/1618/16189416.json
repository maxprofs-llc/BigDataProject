Logit models of supplemental insurance choices provided modest but mixed evidence of self-selection on the basis of observable health status. Wealth had a strong influence on coverage. Two part models of Medicare utilization and expenditures showed that beneficiaries with individually purchased policies had higher total, part B and physician expenditures than those with employer-provided policies, even after controlling for observable differences, suggesting adverse selection. Results were similar for basic and more comprehensive policies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dd1","authors":["Susan L.
