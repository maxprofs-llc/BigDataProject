We sought to review the current requirements for procedural training as well as educational research pertaining to achieving competence in the core nephrology procedures of nontunneled (temporary) hemodialysis catheter insertion and percutaneous kidney biopsy. At this time, there is no universal approach to procedural training and assessment during nephrology fellowship. Nonetheless, simulation-based mastery learning programs have been shown to be effective in improving fellows' skills in nontunneled (temporary) hemodialysis catheter insertion and should be provided by all nephrology training programs. For percutaneous kidney biopsy, the development and evaluation of inexpensive simulators are a promising starting point for future study. Current practice with respect to procedural training during nephrology fellowship remains imperfect; however, the ongoing shift toward competency-based evaluation provides opportunities to refocus on improvement.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f05","authors":["Edward Clark","Jeffrey H.
