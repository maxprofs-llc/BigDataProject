However, evidence supporting this task shift from gastroenterologists to nurses is limited. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of EM-guided and endoscopic nasoenteral feeding tube placement.\nWe performed a multicenter randomized controlled non-inferiority trial in 154 adult patients who required nasoenteral feeding and were admitted to gastrointestinal surgical wards in five Dutch hospitals. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to undergo EM-guided or endoscopic nasoenteral feeding tube placement. The primary end point was the need for reinsertion of the feeding tube (e.g., after failed initial placement or owing to tube-related complications) with a prespecified non-inferiority margin of 10%.\nReinsertion was required in 29 (36%) of the 80 patients in the EM-guided group and 31 (42%) of the 74 patients in the endoscopy group (absolute risk difference -6%, upper limit of one-sided 95% confidence interval 7%; P for non-inferiority=0.022). No differences were noted in success and complication rates. In the EM-guided group, there was a reduced time to start of feeding (424 vs. 535\u2009min, P=0.001). Although the level of discomfort was higher in the EM-guided group (Visual Analog Scale (VAS) 3.9 vs. 2.0, P=0.009), EM-guided placement received higher recommendation scores (VAS 8.2 vs. 5.5, P=0.008).\nEM-guided bedside placement of nasoenteral feeding tubes by nurses was non-inferior to endoscopic placement by gastroenterologists in surgical patients and may be considered the preferred technique for nasoenteral feeding tube placement.Am J Gastroenterol advance online publication, 7 June 2016; doi:10.1038\/ajg.2016.224.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021fa","authors":["Arja Gerritsen","Thijs de Rooij","Marcel G Dijkgraaf","Olivier R Busch","Jacques J Bergman","Dirk T Ubbink","Peter van Duijvendijk","G Willemien Erkelens","Mari\u00ebl Klos","Philip M Kruyt","Dirk Jan Bac","Camiel Rosman","Adriaan C Tan","I Quintus Molenaar","Jan F Monkelbaan","Elisabeth M Mathus-Vliegent","Marc G Besselink"],"doi":"10.1038\/ajg.2016.224","first_seen_on":"2016-06-07T16:39:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0002-9270","1572-0241"],"journal":"American Journal of Gastroenterology","last_mentioned_on":1498076674,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ajg\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/ajg2016224a.html","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27272012?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27272012","pubdate":"2016-06-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Electromagnetic-Guided Bedside Placement of Nasoenteral Feeding Tubes by Nurses Is Non-Inferior to Endoscopic Placement by Gastroenterologists: A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/electromagneticguided-bedside-placement-nasoenteral-feeding-tubes-nurses-noninferior-endoscopic-plac"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8403724,"mean":7.0757025513494,"rank":3616486,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4750304,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8403724,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":273129,"mean":11.597832144635,"rank":106705,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":164380,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":273129,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2391,"mean":11.197317991632,"rank":1589,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":796,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2391,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":18.2965,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":4,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Business, Management and Accounting":1,"Linguistics":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"NL":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MarcBesselink\/statuses\/740217235936022529","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8541642],"posted_on":"2016-06-07T16:21:56+00:00","author":{"name":"Marc Besselink","url":"http:\/\/www.dpcg.nl","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2095949691\/Marc_Besselink_normal.jpg","description":"Professor of pancreatic and hepatobiliary (HPB) surgery, Academic Medical Center (AMC) Amsterdam.
