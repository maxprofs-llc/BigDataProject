To overcome this shortcoming, graphene-coated materials (GCMs) were prepared by loading graphene onto silica nanoparticles (SiO2). With the support of SiO2, the stacked interlamination of graphene was held open to expose the powerful adsorption sites in the interlayers. The adsorption of phenanthrene, a model aromatic pollutant, onto the loaded graphene nanosheets increased up to 100 fold compared with pristine graphene at the same level. The adsorption of GCMs increased with the loading amount of the graphene nanosheets and dramatically decreased with the introduction of oxygen-containing groups in the graphene nanosheets. The highly hydrophobic effect and the strong \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions of the exposed graphene nanosheets contributed to their superior adsorption of GCMs. An unusual GCM peak adsorption coefficient (Kd) was observed with the increase in sorbate concentration. The sorbate concentration at peak Kd shifted to lower values for the reduced graphene oxide and graphene relative to the graphene oxide. Therefore, the replacement of water nanodroplets attached to the graphene nanosheets through weak non-hydrogen bonding with phenanthrene molecules via strong \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions is hypothesized to be an additional adsorption mechanism for GCMs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Kaijie Yang","Baoliang Chen","Lizhong Zhu"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep11641","first_seen_on":"2016-06-07T16:16:57+00:00","issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1492325543,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep11641","https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep11641"],"pmid":"26119007","pubdate":"2015-06-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pollution remediation","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Environmental chemistry","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"11641","subjects":["science"],"title":"Graphene-coated materials using silica particles as a framework for highly efficient removal of aromatic pollutants in water","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/graphenecoated-materials-using-silica-particles-framework-highly-efficient-removal-aromatic-pollutan"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.85,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8076231,"mean":6.8570644748779,"rank":1810717,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":6250813,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8076231,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270605,"mean":11.490900230595,"rank":76516,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":193303,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270605,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32952,"mean":14.936822190525,"rank":10473,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":22383,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32952,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3162,"mean":15.408144258146,"rank":978,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":2172,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3162,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
