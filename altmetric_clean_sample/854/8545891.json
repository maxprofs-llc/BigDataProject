Among ALD transplants, of 31 with alcohol use, 23 (74%) relapsed at \u22652\u2009year, 25 (80%) reported intermittent drinking and 4 (13%) reported heavy drinking. Among Non-ALD recipients, alcohol use was equally distributed to within 2, 2-5 and after 5\u2009years of LT with 82% reporting intermittent drinking and 9% heavy drinking. Patients with pre-transplant drinking of >20\u2009years and abstinence duration of <2\u2009years were over\u00a02.5-fold likely to report post-transplant alcohol use compared to drinking of >20\u2009years and abstinence of >2\u2009years, 2.56 [95% CI: 1.41-4.67]. Etiology (ALD vs. non-ALD) did not predict post-transplant alcohol use. Of 139 ALD patients with follow-up biopsy data, 13 (7 with post-transplant alcohol use) had steatohepatitis. Histology on 319 non-ALD recipients showed recurrent disease in 91, none due to alcohol. Overall survival was similar between drinkers and abstainers (71% vs. 66%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.35). Recurrent ALD was cause of death in one ALD and none of non-ALD patients.\nAlcohol use after LT is independent of LT indication. Patients with non-ALD etiology should be carefully screened for alcohol use prior to LT to identify those at risk for post-LT alcohol use.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021c6","authors":["Kirk B Russ","Nai-Wei Chen","Patrick S Kamath","Vijay H Shah","Yong-Fang Kuo","Ashwani K Singal"],"doi":"10.1093\/alcalc\/agw032","endpage":"701","first_seen_on":"2016-06-07T18:12:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1464-3502"],"issue":"6","journal":"Alcohol & Alcoholism","last_mentioned_on":1477568264,"links":["http:\/\/alcalc.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/06\/03\/alcalc.agw032.large.jpg?rss=1&utm_content=buffer6c4d0&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/alcalc.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/06\/03\/alcalc.agw032.abstract?papetoc","http:\/\/alcalc.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/51\/6\/698?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/alcalc.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/alcalc\/early\/2016\/06\/03\/alcalc.agw032.full.pdf","pmid":"27267907","pubdate":"2016-06-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"698","subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"Alcohol Use after Liver Transplantation is Independent of Liver Disease Etiology","type":"article","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alcohol-after-liver-transplantation-independent-liver-disease-etiology"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7601780,"mean":6.5482482934541,"rank":3479119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":3951263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7601780,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266806,"mean":11.372081595172,"rank":121223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":136883,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266806,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1008,"mean":6.4268202581927,"rank":625,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1008,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":11.125185185185,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Unspecified":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/drmanejwala\/statuses\/740244999078612992","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8545891],"posted_on":"2016-06-07T18:12:15+00:00","author":{"name":"Omar S.
