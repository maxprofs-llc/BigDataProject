Second, we evaluated food intake (FI) following blockade of gut hormonal secretion in G-WL (n=23) or P-WLM (n=19) subjects. Finally, the impact of dietary-induced WL on the hormonal response in subjects with P-WLM (n=14) was assessed.\nTertiary hospital.\nStudies 1 and 3: area under the curve of gut hormones following a SMLM. Study 2: FI following subcutaneous injection of saline or octreotide.\nP-WLM associated a blunted GLP-1 (p=0.044) and PYY (p=0.001) responses and lesser suppression of ghrelin (p=0.032) following the SMLM challenge. On saline-day, FI in the G-WL (393\u00b1143 kcal) group was less than in the P-WLM (519\u00b1143 Kcal; p=0.014) group. Octreotide injection resulted in enlarged FI in both groups (G-WL: 579\u00b1248 kcal, p=0.014; P-WLM: 798\u00b1284 Kcal, p=0.036) but the difference in FI between groups remained (p<0.001). In subjects with P-WLM, dietary-induced WL resulted in larger ghrelin suppression (p=0.046) but no change in the GLP-1 or PYY responses.\nOur data show gastrointestinal hormones play a role in the control of FI following RYGB, but do not support changes in GLP-1, PYY, or ghrelin play a major role as determinants of P-WLM after this type of surgery.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be1","authors":["de Hollanda, Ana","Casals, Gregori","Delgado, Salvadora","Jim\u00e9nez, Amanda","Viaplana, Judith","Lacy, Antonio M","Vidal, Josep"],"doi":"10.1210\/jc.2015-3065","endpage":"4684","first_seen_on":"2016-04-19T13:44:23+00:00","issns":["1945-7197","0021-972X"],"issue":"12","journal":"The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1461061749,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26505823?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26505823","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"4677","subjects":["metabolism","endocrinology"],"title":"Gastrointestinal Hormones and Weight Loss Maintenance Following Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass","type":"article","volume":"100","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gastrointestinal-hormones-weight-loss-maintenance-following-rouxeny-gastric-bypass"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7571218,"mean":6.5337981331095,"rank":5462829,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1840704,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7571218,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267998,"mean":11.28234114561,"rank":172276,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":80452,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267998,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6563,"mean":8.1674964949711,"rank":5195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":1194,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6563,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118,"mean":18.692444444444,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
