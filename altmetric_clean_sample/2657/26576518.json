As nevirapine (NVP)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) tends to increase HDL-C, gene polymorphisms associated with HDL-C metabolism in HIV-infected adults on stable NVP-based ART were studied.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted between January 2013 and July 2014 among adults receiving NVP-based ART for 12-15 months. Blood lipids were estimated and gene polymorphisms in apolipoprotein C3 (APOC3), cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) genes were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Framingham's 10-yr CVD risk score was estimated. Logistic regression was done to show factors related to low HDL-C levels.\nOf the 300 patients included (mean age: 38.6\u00b18.7 yr; mean CD4 count 449\u00b1210 cell\/\u03bcl), total cholesterol (TC) >200 mg\/dl was observed in 116 (39%) patients. Thirty nine per cent males and 47 per cent females had HDL-C levels below normal while 32 per cent males and 37 per cent females had TC\/HDL ratio of 4.5 and 4.0, respectively. Body mass index [adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=1.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-2.84, P=0.04] and viral load (aOR=3.39, 95% CI: 1.52-7.52, P=0.003) were negatively associated with serum HDL-C levels. The 10-yr risk score of developing CVD was 11-20 per cent in 3 per cent patients. Allelic variants of APOC3 showed a trend towards low HDL-C.\nHigh-risk lipid profiles for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease were common among HIV-infected individuals, even after 12 months of NVP-based ART. Targeted interventions to address these factors should be recommended in the national ART programmes.","authors":["Padmapriyadarsini","C Padmapriyadarsini","K Ramesh","L Sekar","Geetha Ramachandran","Devaraj Reddy","G Narendran","S Sekar","C Chandrasekar","D Anbarasu","Christine Wanke","Soumya Swaminathan"],"doi":"10.4103\/ijmr.ijmr_1611_15","first_seen_on":"2017-09-26T03:27:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0971-5916"],"issue":"5","journal":"Indian Journal of Medical Research","last_mentioned_on":1506396415,"links":["http:\/\/www.ijmr.org.in\/article.asp?issn=0971-5916%3Byear%3D2017%3Bvolume%3D145%3Bissue%3D5%3Bspage%3D641%3Bepage%3D650%3Baulast%3DPadmapriyadarsini#.WcnI5Jf91ps.twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ijmr.org.in\/article.asp?issn=0971-5916;year=2017;volume=145;issue=5;spage=641;epage=650;aulast=Padmapriyadarsini;type=2","pmid":"28948955","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medknow Publications","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Factors affecting high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in HIV-infected patients on nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy","type":"article","volume":"145","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/factors-affecting-highdensity-lipoprotein-cholesterol-hivinfected-patients-nevirapinebased-antiretro"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0.25,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/rocatanho\/statuses\/912518822355140608","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26576518],"posted_on":"2017-09-26T03:26:55+00:00","author":{"name":"rodolfo catanho","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/418701421031088129\/F1CIU3nb_normal.jpeg","description":"internist.  proudly friend of my friends.
