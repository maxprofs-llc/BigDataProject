After taking royal jelly and several other medicinal products, a 33-year-old Japanese male developed severe facial pruritus and erythema, followed by vertigo, numbness in his fingers, generalized pruritus, wheals, dyspnea, wheezing and impaired consciousness. He was treated with corticosteroid and fluid therapy, and his symptoms subsided. Upon allergy testing, his only positive reaction was to royal jelly. Given the clinical symptoms and the positive prick test to royal jelly, a diagnosis of anaphylaxis due to the ingestion of royal jelly was made. In this paper, we describe this case and review the relevant published work.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c37","authors":["TAKAHAMA, Hideto","SHIMAZU, Takekazu"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1346-8138.2006.00100.x","endpage":"426","first_seen_on":"2014-08-05T13:05:01+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1346-8138","0385-2407"],"issue":"6","journal":"The Journal of Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1407218101,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1346-8138.2006.00100.x\/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&userIsAuthenticated=false","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1346-8138.2006.00100.x","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16700835"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1346-8138.2006.00100.x\/pdf","pmid":"16700835","pubdate":"2006-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Asia","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"424","subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Food-induced anaphylaxis caused by ingestion of royal jelly.","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/foodinduced-anaphylaxis-caused-ingestion-royal-jelly"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6418668,"mean":5.9879820074789,"rank":1401182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":4991437,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6418668,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":151307,"mean":8.0804810252074,"rank":40447,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":110237,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":151307,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":563,"mean":2.5216725978648,"rank":80,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":482,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":563,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":0.90625,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Royal jelly","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=511417170#altmetric_citation_7","license":"public","citation_ids":[2572342],"posted_on":"2012-09-08T19:00:56+00:00","summary":"Royal jelly is a honey bee secretion that is used in the nutrition of larvae, as well as adult queens.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=418151","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Citation bot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Citation bot"}}],"video":[{"title":"RISE Nutrition - All About Honeybees and Honeybee Products","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PePTyXutz_Q","image":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/PePTyXutz_Q\/hqdefault.jpg","license":"public","citation_ids":[614733,2572334,2572335,2572336,2572337,2572338,2572339,213031,2572340,1286984,2572341,2572342,2572343,1172468,2572344,2527745,2572345,2572346,2572347,2572348,2572349],"posted_on":"2014-08-05T05:55:01+00:00","summary":"Collin Chi, C.N.C., referencing over 43 clinical studies, discusses well-researched possibilities of MEDICINAL BENEFIT, as well as the PHYTOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES of PROPOLIS, ROYAL JELLY, BEE POLLEN and honey.
