It is thus unclear to what degree the observed abnormalities are due to the uraemic state and how much is due to disuse. The present study was undertaken to attempt to investigate this question by examining a non-locomotor muscle (rectus abdominis) in patients with end-stage renal failure.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f61000317f","authors":["Giorgos K Sakkas","Derek Ball","Thomas H Mercer","Anthony J Sargeant","Keith Tolfrey","Patrick F Naish","Sakkas, Giorgos K","Ball, Derek","Mercer, Thomas H","Sargeant, Anthony J","Tolfrey, Keith","Naish, Patrick F","G.
