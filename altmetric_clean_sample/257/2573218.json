Thin and short roots of the primary molars were observed, as were microdontia and anodontia of the premolars. The boy suffered from severe early childhood caries (ECC). Dental treatment was carried out under general anesthesia. Follow-up examinations at three, six and twelve months after the initial dental treatment revealed healthy gingival tissue and no new caries. The boy passed away before the next scheduled follow-up dental examination.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f5f","authors":["B Peretz","H Sarnat","J Kharouba"],"first_seen_on":"2014-08-06T11:31:11+00:00","issns":["1053-4628"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Clinical Pediatric Dentistry","last_mentioned_on":1407320197,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25095321?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25095321","pubdate":"2014-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry","pediatrics"],"title":"Chemotherapy Induced Dental Changes in a Child with Medulloblastoma: A Case Report.","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chemotherapy-induced-dental-changes-child-medulloblastoma-case-report"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4113006,"mean":5.1054066695351,"rank":3293034,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":101012,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4113006,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102786,"mean":8.1085182079098,"rank":82072,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":346,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102786,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73,"mean":1.1131666666667,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.6,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Computer Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/status\/496963043679428611","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2573218],"posted_on":"2014-08-06T10:16:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
