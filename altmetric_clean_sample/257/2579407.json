Compared to other forms of diabetes, young-onset T2DM experiences more cardiovascular events and other vascular complications although the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Increased arterial stiffness is a hallmark of vasculopathy. We aim to study the clinical and metabolic determinants of arterial stiffness in a cohort of multi-ethnic Asians with young-onset T2DM.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002346","doi":"10.1016\/j.atherosclerosis.2014.07.017","first_seen_on":"2014-08-07T16:11:48+00:00","issns":["0021-9150"],"journal":"Atherosclerosis (00219150)","last_mentioned_on":1407427832,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=6&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.atherosclerosis-journal.com%2Farticle%2FS0021-9150%252814%252901293-3%2Fabstract&code=ath-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.atherosclerosis-journal.com\/article\/S0021915014012933\/pdf","pmid":"25112799","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Obesity is a determinant of arterial stiffness independent of traditional risk factors in Asians with young- onset type 2 diabetes","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/obesity-determinant-arterial-stiffness-independent-traditional-risk-factors-asians-youngonset-type-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4508612,"mean":5.1916753366762,"rank":3034256,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":912528,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4508612,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110181,"mean":8.2576815574517,"rank":71928,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":24613,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110181,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1138,"mean":2.7820703605981,"rank":707,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":272,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1138,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":2.0217391304348,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
