This study assessed knowledge and perceptions of late effects risk before and after a survivor clinic visit. Young adult survivors (\u2265 16 years) and parents of child survivors (< 16 years) were recruited prior to initial visit to a cancer survivor program. Sixty-five participants completed a baseline survey and 50 completed both a baseline and follow-up survey. Participants were found to have a low perceived likelihood of developing a late effect of cancer therapy and many incorrect perceptions of risk for individual late effects. Low knowledge before clinic (odds ratio = 9.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-92.8; P = .02) and low perceived likelihood of developing a late effect (odds ratio = 18.7; 95% confidence interval, 2.7-242.3; P = .01) were found to predict low knowledge of late effect risk at follow-up. This suggests that perceived likelihood of developing a late effect is an important factor in the individuals' ability to learn about their risk and should be addressed before initiation of education.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a87","authors":["Cherven B","Mertens A","Meacham LR","Williamson R","Boring C","Wasilewski-Masker K"],"doi":"10.1177\/1043454214532022","first_seen_on":"2014-08-06T15:21:08+00:00","issns":["1043-4542"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Pediatric Oncology Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1407338444,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25013005?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25013005","pubdate":"2014-07-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing","neoplasms","pediatrics"],"title":"Knowledge and Risk Perception of Late Effects Among Childhood Cancer Survivors and Parents Before and After Visiting a Childhood Cancer Survivor Clinic.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/knowledge-risk-perception-late-effects-among-childhood-cancer-survivors-parents-before-after-visitin-6"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":3054484,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":938283,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110305,"mean":8.069926367131,"rank":72738,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":26665,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110305,"percentile":24},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109,"mean":2.3809259259259,"rank":66,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.825,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Social Sciences":1,"Decision Sciences":1,"Psychology":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/notimetoteach\/status\/497039579472752640","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2576036],"posted_on":"2014-08-06T15:20:44+00:00","author":{"name":"Fran London","url":"http:\/\/www.notimetoteach.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/728973617132765184\/tnVXwHdc_normal.jpg","description":"After saving lives, the most important service of health care providers is patient and family education. 2010 AJN Book of the Year. 2016 edition now available.","id_on_source":"notimetoteach","tweeter_id":"68849705","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":761},"tweet_id":"497039579472752640"}]}}
