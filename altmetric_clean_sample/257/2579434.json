HF rats demonstrated higher pulmonary ventilation (PV), which was not affected by PYR. When HF and control rats treated or untreated with PYR were exposed to 15% O2, all groups exhibited prompt increases in respiratory frequency (RF), tidal volume (TV) and PV. When HF rats were exposed to 10% O2 they showed greater PV response which was prevented by PYR. The hypercapnia triggered by either 5% CO2 or 10% CO2 promoted greater RF and PV responses in HF rats. PYR blunted the RF response in HF rats but did not affect the PV response. In conclusion, PYR prevented increased peripheral chemoreflex sensitivity, partially blunted central chemoreflex sensitivity and did not affect basal PV in HF rats.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002383","authors":["Sabino JP","da Silva CA","Giusti H","Glass ML","Salgado HC","Fazan R Jr"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.autneu.2013.07.001","first_seen_on":"2014-08-07T16:22:56+00:00","issns":["1566-0702"],"issue":"","journal":"Autonomic Neuroscience: Basic & Clinical","last_mentioned_on":1407428531,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23911533?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23911533","pubdate":"2013-08-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Parasympathetic activation by pyridostigmine on chemoreflex sensitivity in heart-failure rats.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/parasympathetic-activation-pyridostigmine-chemoreflex-sensitivity-heartfailure-rats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4115913,"mean":5.1087243297393,"rank":3295420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":101196,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4115913,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102675,"mean":8.1297443754018,"rank":82006,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":346,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102675,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231,"mean":1.6244608695652,"rank":161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.8821428571429,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
