Microbes acted as a living conductive template on which PPy was in situ polymerized. The as-prepared PPy-MP exhibit the distinctive underwater low adhesive superoleophobicity which is attributable to the unique hierarchical micro\/nano-structures and the high surface energy by doping with inorganic small anions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f61000823d","authors":["Cheng Z","Ding C","Liu H","Zhu Y","Jiang L"],"doi":"10.1039\/c3nr03788f","first_seen_on":"2014-08-05T10:05:55+00:00","issns":["2040-3364"],"issue":"","journal":"Nanoscale","last_mentioned_on":1407233138,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24232441?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24232441","pubdate":"2013-11-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"A facile bacterial assisted electrochemical self-assembly of polypyrrole micro-pillars: towards underwater low adhesive superoleophobicity.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/facile-bacterial-assisted-electrochemical-selfassembly-polypyrrole-micropillars-towards-underwater-l"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4108362,"mean":5.1034434819395,"rank":3289318,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":101201,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4108362,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102779,"mean":8.0903043063691,"rank":82008,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":356,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102779,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1121,"mean":3.5332696428571,"rank":716,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1121,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":4.440619047619,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
