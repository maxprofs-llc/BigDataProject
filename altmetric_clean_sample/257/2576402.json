Here we show that Uls1 is implicated in DNA repair independently of the replication stress response pathways mediated by the endonucleases Mus81 and Yen1 and the helicases Mph1 and Srs2. Uls1 works together with Sgs1 and we demonstrate that the attenuation of replication stress-related defects in sgs1\u0394 by deletion of ULS1 depends on a functional of Rad51 recombinase and post-replication repair pathway mediated by Rad18 and Rad5, but not on the translesion polymerase, Rev3. The higher resistance of sgs1\u0394 uls1\u0394 mutants to genotoxic stress compared to single sgs1\u0394 cells is not the result of decreased formation or accelerated resolution of recombination-dependent DNA structures. Instead, deletion of ULS1 restores stability of the rDNA region in sgs1\u0394 cells. Our data suggest that Uls1 may contribute to genomic stability during DNA synthesis and channel the repair of replication lesions into the Sgs1-dependent pathway, with DNA translocase and SUMO binding activities of Uls1 as well as a RING domain being essential for its functions in replication stress response.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002726","authors":["Karol Kramarz","Ireneusz Litwin","Magdalena Cal-B\u0105kowska","Barnabas Szakal","Dana Branzei","Robert Wysocki","Dorota Dziadkowiec"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.dnarep.2014.05.008","first_seen_on":"2014-08-06T17:41:09+00:00","issns":["1568-7856"],"journal":"DNA Repair","last_mentioned_on":1407346805,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25091157?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25091157","pubdate":"2014-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Swi2\/Snf2-like protein Uls1 functions in the Sgs1-dependent pathway of maintenance of rDNA stability and alleviation of replication stress.","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/swi2snf2like-protein-uls1-functions-sgs1dependent-pathway-maintenance-rdna-stability-alleviation-rep"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4113006,"mean":5.1054066695351,"rank":3293035,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":101010,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4113006,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102785,"mean":8.10860439368,"rank":82074,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":344,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102785,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319,"mean":1.5055094339623,"rank":212,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":0.85333333333333,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
