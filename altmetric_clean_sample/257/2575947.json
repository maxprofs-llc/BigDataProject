This cycle can also be considered as a good benchmark for the evaluation of early-stage strategies aiming at designing drugs that bind to RNA, with the possibility to correlate in vitro activities with antiviral properties. In this review, we highlight different approaches developed to interfere with four important steps of the HIV-1 replication cycle: the early stage of reverse transcription, the transactivation of viral transcription, the nuclear export of partially spliced transcripts and the dimerization step.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e5f","authors":["Blond, Aur\u00e9lie","Ennifar, Eric","Tisn\u00e9, Carine","Micouin, Laurent"],"doi":"10.1002\/cmdc.201402259","endpage":"1996","first_seen_on":"2014-08-06T14:51:50+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1860-7187","1860-7179"],"issue":"9","journal":"ChemMedChem","last_mentioned_on":1407395290,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cmdc.201402259\/abstract;jsessionid=F789DCC14949D62B8F6D513B356F0CB1.f04t02","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/cmdc.201402259"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cmdc.201402259\/pdf","pmid":"25100137","pubdate":"2014-08-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1982","subjects":["chemistry","pharmacology"],"title":"The Design of RNA Binders: Targeting the HIV Replication Cycle as a Case Study","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/design-rna-binders-targeting-hiv-replication-cycle-case-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6313717,"mean":5.974891785441,"rank":2556153,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":3731177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6313717,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145508,"mean":8.1817452768597,"rank":58816,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":85785,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145508,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":800,"mean":2.1961351689612,"rank":184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":618,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":800,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":0.9014,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
