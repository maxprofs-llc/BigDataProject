The intergenic region (IGR) IRES of the Dicistroviridae uses a streamlined mechanism in which it can directly recruit the ribosome in the absence of initiation factors and initiates translation using a non-AUG codon. A subset of IGR IRESs including that from the honey bee viruses can also direct translation of an overlapping +1 frame gene. In this study, we systematically examined cellular conditions that lead to IGR IRES-mediated 0 and +1 frame translation in Drosophila S2 cells. Towards this, a novel bicistronic reporter that exploits the 2A \"stop-go\" peptide was developed to allow the detection of IRES-mediated translation in vivo. Both 0 and +1 frame translation by the IGR IRES are stimulated under a number of cellular stresses and in S2 cells infected by cricket paralysis virus, demonstrating a switch from cap-dependent to IRES-dependent translation. The regulation of the IGR IRES mechanism ensures that both 0 frame viral structural proteins and +1 frame ORFx protein are optimally expressed during virus infection.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Qing S Wang","Eric Jan"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0103601","first_seen_on":"2014-08-05T10:37:59+00:00","funders":["cihr"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"8","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1407235039,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25089704?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25089704","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Switch from Cap- to Factorless IRES-Dependent 0 and +1 Frame Translation during Cellular Stress and Dicistrovirus Infection.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/switch-cap-factorless-iresdependent-0-1-frame-translation-during-cellular-stress-dicistrovirus-infec"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4108362,"mean":5.1034434819395,"rank":3289291,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":101216,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4108362,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102777,"mean":8.0985829571107,"rank":82007,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":355,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102777,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72666,"mean":8.339836234776,"rank":57986,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":218,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72666,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1884,"mean":15.685360594796,"rank":1579,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1884,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
