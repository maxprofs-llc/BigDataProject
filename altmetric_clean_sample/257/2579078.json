The aim of this study was to assess the fetal risk after intrauterine fluoroquinolone exposure. We performed an observational study of a prospectively ascertained cohort of pregnant women exposed to a fluoroquinolone during the first trimester. Pregnancy outcomes were compared to those of a cohort exposed to neither fluoroquinolones nor teratogenic or fetotoxic drugs. The outcomes evaluated were major birth defects (structural abnormalities of medical, surgical, or cosmetic relevance), spontaneous abortion, and elective termination of pregnancy. Pregnancy outcomes of 949 women with fluoroquinolone treatment were compared with those of 3,796 nonexposed controls. Neither the rate of major birth defects (2.4%; adjusted odds ratio [ORadj], 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6 to 1.5) nor the risk of spontaneous abortion (adjusted hazard ratio [HRadj], 1.01; 95% CI, 0.8 to 1.3) was increased. However, there was a nonsignificant increase in major birth defects after exposure to moxifloxacin (6\/93, 6.5%; crude odds ratio [ORcrude], 2.40; 95% CI, 0.8 to 5.6). Neither a critical exposure time window within the first trimester nor a specific pattern of birth defects was demonstrated for any of the fluoroquinolones. The rate of electively terminated pregnancies was increased among the fluoroquinolone-exposed women (HRadj, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.7). The gestational ages at delivery and birth weights did not differ between groups. Our study did not detect an increased risk of spontaneous abortion or major birth defects. These reassuring findings support the recommendation to allow fluoroquinolone use in early pregnancy in selected cases. After the use of moxifloxacin, a detailed fetal ultrasound examination should be considered.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a6a","authors":["Stephanie Padberg","Evelin Wacker","Reinhard Meister","Mary Panse","Corinna Weber-Schoendorfer","Marc Oppermann","Christof Schaefer","S.
