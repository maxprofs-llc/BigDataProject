The critical temperatures and densities were estimated by a finite-size scaling analysis with the help of histogram reweighting technique. The vapor-liquid coexistence curve in the near-critical region was determined using hyper-parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations. The simulation results for coexistence diameters show that the contribution of |t|(1-\u03b1) to the coexistence diameter dominates the singular behavior in all systems investigated. The contribution of |t|(2\u03b2) to the coexistence diameter is larger for the system with a smaller interaction range \u03bb. While for short square well chain fluids, longer the chain length, larger the contribution of |t|(2\u03b2). The molecular configuration greatly influences the critical asymmetry: a short soft chain fluid shows weaker critical asymmetry than a stiff chain fluid with same chain length.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cee","authors":["Liyan Li","Liyan Li","Fangfang Sun","Zhitong Chen","Long Wang","Jun Cai"],"doi":"10.1063\/1.4891799","first_seen_on":"2014-08-07T14:30:01+00:00","issns":["1089-7690"],"journal":"Journal of Chemical Physics","last_mentioned_on":1407421772,"links":["http:\/\/scitation.aip.org\/content\/aip\/journal\/jcp\/141\/5\/10.1063\/1.4891799"],"pmid":"25106611","pubdate":"2014-08-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"AIP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"title":"Vapor-liquid equilibrium and critical asymmetry of square well and short square well chain fluids","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vaporliquid-equilibrium-critical-asymmetry-square-short-square-chain-fluids"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":3039464,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":928663,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110171,"mean":8.1677268584917,"rank":72305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":25033,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110171,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3787,"mean":2.0697522451136,"rank":1847,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1237,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3787,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":200,"mean":2.9532964824121,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":78,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":200,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
