While larger bicelles are closer to the true lipid bilayer, it remains unclear how large the bicelles need to be to allow accurate assessment of protein transmembrane partition in lipid bilayer. Here, we address the above question from the perspective of protein residing in the bicelles, through systematic measurement of protein chemical shift and transmembrane partition at different lipid:detergent ratios (q), ranging from 0.3 to 0.7, using the transmembrane domain of human Fas receptor as model system. We found that the lipid environment of the bicelles, as reflected by the protein chemical shift, begins to be perturbed when the q is reduced to below 0.6. We also implemented a solvent paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) approach for bicelles to show that the protein transmembrane partition in bicelles with q = 0.5 and 0.7 are very similar, but at q = 0.3 the solvent PRE profile is significantly different. Our data indicate that q values between 0.5 and 0.6 are good compromise between high resolution NMR and closeness to the membrane environment, and allow accurate characterization of protein position in lipid bilayer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Piai, Alessandro","Fu, Qingshan","Dev, Jyoti","Chou, James J."],"doi":"10.1002\/chem.201604206","first_seen_on":"2016-12-22T12:35:31+00:00","funders":["nigms","nhlbi","niaid"],"issns":["1521-3765"],"journal":"Chemistry - A European Journal","last_mentioned_on":1483443228,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201604206\/abstract;jsessionid=801876B332036C3A5FB56DCBEF174951.f03t01","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201604206\/abstract?campaign=wolsavedsearch&utm_content=bufferf3791&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201604206\/pdf","pmid":"27747952","pubdate":"2016-12-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Optimal Bicelle q for Solution NMR Studies of Protein Transmembrane Partition","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/optimal-bicelle-size-q-solution-nmr-studies-protein-transmembrane-partition"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7976486,"mean":6.7343932358615,"rank":5761426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1930119,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7976486,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254696,"mean":12.356782991421,"rank":166666,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":74760,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254696,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5778,"mean":3.1124864116323,"rank":3123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":2377,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5778,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":663,"mean":3.2647613293051,"rank":307,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":310,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":663,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
