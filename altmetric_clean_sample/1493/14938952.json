This review examines dual informant studies to assess parent-child agreement on the QoL of children with attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder. A systematic search of four major databases (PsycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases) was completed, and related peer-reviewed journals were hand-searched. Studies which reported quantitative QoL ratings for matched parent and child dyads were screened in accordance with relevant inclusion and exclusion criteria. Key findings were extracted from thirteen relevant studies, which were rated for conformity to the recommendations of an adapted version of the STROBE statement guidelines for observational studies. In the majority of studies reviewed, children rated their QoL more highly than their parents. There was some evidence for greater agreement on the physical health domain than psychosocial domains.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006883","authors":["Helen Galloway","Emily Newman","Galloway, Helen","Newman, Emily"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12402-016-0210-9","first_seen_on":"2016-12-22T13:16:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1866-6647","1866-6116"],"journal":"ADHD Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1483956463,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs12402-016-0210-9","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28005216","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s12402-016-0210-9"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs12402-016-0210-9.pdf","pmid":"28005216","pubdate":"2016-12-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Vienna","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Is there a difference between child self-ratings and parent proxy-ratings of the quality of life of children with a diagnosis of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?
