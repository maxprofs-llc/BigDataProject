The authors also assessed the association between TXA use and other clinical outcomes (length of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality).\nA nationwide, retrospective cohort study using propensity score analyses.\nJapanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination inpatient database.\nPediatric patients who underwent cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass between July 2010 and March 2014 (N = 11,275).\nNone.\nPropensity-score matching created 3,739 pairs of patients with and without TXA administration. Propensity-matched analysis showed that the proportion of seizures was significantly higher in the TXA group than in the non-TXA group (1.6% v 0.2%, difference, 1.4%; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.9; p<0.001). However, none of the other outcomes was significantly different between the groups.\nTXA use is associated with a significantly increased risk of seizures. However, there is no difference in any other outcomes between the TXA and non-TXA groups.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bb4","authors":["Takuma Maeda","Yusuke Sasabuchi","Hiroki Matsui","Yoshihiko Ohnishi","Shigeki Miyata","Hideo Yasunaga"],"doi":"10.1053\/j.jvca.2016.10.001","first_seen_on":"2016-12-22T11:05:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-8422","10530770"],"journal":"Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia","last_mentioned_on":1482404720,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jcvaonline.com%2Farticle%2FS1053-0770%2816%2930451-7%2Ffulltext%3Frss%3Dyes&rc=0&code=yjcan-site","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S1053077016304517&_version=1&md5=3e205e728fc016c0eb34e86a087e64b1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jcvaonline.com\/article\/S1053077016304517\/pdf","pmid":"27988092","pubdate":"2016-12-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["anesthesiology","cardiology","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Safety of Tranexamic Acid in Pediatric Cardiac Surgery: A Nationwide Database Study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/safety-tranexamic-acid-pediatric-cardiac-surgery-nationwide-database-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8233879,"mean":6.9714785601567,"rank":5958725,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1982368,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8233879,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268131,"mean":12.276196785141,"rank":176036,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":78969,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268131,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1090,"mean":0.8972984389348,"rank":284,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":762,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1090,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85,"mean":0.53869047619048,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":68,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
