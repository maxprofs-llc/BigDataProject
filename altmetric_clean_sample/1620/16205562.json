We estimated the numbers of various components of such complexes in an HeLa cell by quantitative immunoblotting. The cells were lysed with saponin in a physiological buffer; approximately 140,000 unengaged polymerases (mainly of form IIA) were released. Only approximately 4,000 of these soluble molecules sedimented in glycerol gradients as holoenzyme-sized complexes. About 180,000 molecules of polymerases (approximately 110,000 molecules of form IIO) and 10,000 to 30,000 molecules of each of TFIIB, TFIIEalpha, TFIIEbeta, TFIIF-RAP74, TFIIF-RAP30, and TFIIH-MAT1 remained tightly associated with the nuclear substructure. Most proteins and run-on activity were retained when approximately 50% of the chromatin was detached with a nuclease, but approximately 45,000 molecules of bound TATA binding protein (TBP) were detached. Similar results were obtained after cross-linking living cells with formaldehyde. The results provide little support for the existence of a large pool of soluble holoenzyme; they are consistent with TBP-promoter complexes in nuclease-sensitive chromatin being assembled into preinitiation complexes attached to the underlying structure.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f61000310d","authors":["Hiroshi Kimura","Yong Tao","Robert G.
