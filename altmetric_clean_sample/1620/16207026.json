Regional anesthesia has been occasionally applied in high risk patients where general anesthesia is contraindicated. This randomized clinical trial compares spinal anesthesia with general anesthesia for TAPP inguinal hernia repair in non-high risk patients.\nSeventy adult American Society of Anesthesiologists I, II and III patients undergoing elective TAPP inguinal hernia repair were randomized to either general or spinal anesthesia.\nPostoperative morphine consumption was significantly less immediately postoperatively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in the spinal anesthesia group. Postoperative pain was also significantly decreased within the first 8\u00a0h postoperatively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in the spinal anesthesia group.\nSpinal anesthesia offers some advantages in patient analgesia during the early postoperative period after TAPP inguinal hernia repair and can be proposed as an effective alternative method of anesthesia for TAPP repair.\nThis randomized clinical trial compares spinal anesthesia with general anesthesia for TAPP inguinal hernia repair in non-high risk patients. Spinal anesthesia can be proposed as an effective alternative method of anesthesia for TAPP repair.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000221f","authors":["Chamaidi Sarakatsianou","Stavroula Georgopoulou","Ioannis Baloyiannis","Maria Chatzimichail","George Vretzakis","Dimitris Zacharoulis","George Tzovaras"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.amjsurg.2017.01.032","first_seen_on":"2017-02-07T20:05:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00029610","1879-1883"],"journal":"American Journal of Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1486497656,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=3&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.americanjournalofsurgery.com%2Farticle%2FS0002-9610%252816%252930741-3%2Ffulltext&code=ajs-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.americanjournalofsurgery.com\/article\/S0002961016307413\/pdf","pmid":"28173938","pubdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Spinal versus general anesthesia for transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair of inguinal hernia: Interim analysis of a controlled randomized trial","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0002961016307413","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/spinal-versus-general-anesthesia-transabdominal-preperitoneal-tapp-repair-inguinal-hernia-interim-an-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8172683,"mean":6.9158600214652,"rank":6206548,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1100031,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8172683,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263987,"mean":12.852880728523,"rank":191366,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":44851,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263987,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2100,"mean":3.3207870414483,"rank":1432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2100,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65,"mean":2.63640625,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AmJSurgery\/statuses\/829057375327891457","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16207026],"posted_on":"2017-02-07T20:00:56+00:00","author":{"name":"AmJSurgery","url":"http:\/\/www.americanjournalofsurgery.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/583720504277782529\/CosJCurw_normal.jpg","description":"American Journal of Surgery","id_on_source":"AmJSurgery","tweeter_id":"3131344053","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2647},"tweet_id":"829057375327891457"}]}}
