We used linked administrative data and statistical decomposition techniques to generate new insights into black and white differences in child maltreatment reports and foster care placements. Methods Birth records for all children born in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, between 2008 and 2010 were linked to administrative service records originating in multiple county data systems. Differences in rates of involvement with child protective services between black and white children by age 4 were decomposed using nonlinear regression techniques. Results Black children had rates of CPS involvement that were 3 times higher than white children. Racial differences were explained solely by parental marital status (i.e., being unmarried) and age at birth (i.e., predominantly teenage mothers). Adding other covariates did not capture any further racial differences in maltreatment reporting or foster care placement\u00a0rates, they simply shifted differences already explained by marital status and age to these other variables. Discussion Racial differences in rates of\u00a0maltreatment reports and foster care placements can be explained by a basic model that adjusts only for parental marital status and age at the time of birth. Increasing access to early prevention services for vulnerable families may reduce disparities in child protective service involvement. Using birth records linked to other administrative data sources provides an important means to developing population-based research.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5013cf058f610003065","authors":["Tim Maloney","Nan Jiang","Emily Putnam-Hornstein","Erin Dalton","Rhema Vaithianathan"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10995-016-2242-3","first_seen_on":"2017-02-07T21:19:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1092-7875","1573-6628"],"journal":"Maternal & Child Health Journal","last_mentioned_on":1490368739,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10995-016-2242-3","https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10995-016-2242-3"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10995-016-2242-3.pdf","pmid":"28124189","pubdate":"2017-01-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Gynecology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Maternal and Child Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pediatrics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Population Economics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Sociology, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Studies In Human Society","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["perinatology"],"title":"Black\u2013White Differences in Child Maltreatment Reports and Foster Care Placements: A Statistical Decomposition Using Linked Administrative Data","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s10995-016-2242-3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/blackwhite-differences-child-maltreatment-reports-foster-care-placements-statistical-decomposition-u"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":3656273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4632398,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279313,"mean":12.615670196769,"rank":118974,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":155633,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279313,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1090,"mean":7.8088999081726,"rank":533,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":537,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1090,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":3.9677419354839,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
