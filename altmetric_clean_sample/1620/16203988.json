Our study objective was to evaluate the prognostic utility of a modified HEART score (m-HS) within this trial.\nTwelve centers evaluated 1282 patients in the emergency department for possible AMI from 2011 to 2013. Measurements of hs-cTnT (99th percentile, 14 ng\/L) were performed at 0, 1, 2, and 4 to 14 hours. Evaluation for major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) occurred at 30 days (death or AMI). Low-risk patients had an m-HS\u22643 and had either hs-cTnT<14 ng\/L over serial testing or had AMI excluded by the 1-hour protocol. By the 1-hour protocol, 777 (60%) patients had an AMI excluded. Of those 777 patients, 515 (66.3%) patients had an m-HS\u22643, with 1 (0.2%) patient having a MACE, and 262 (33.7%) patients had an m-HS\u22654, with 6 (2.3%) patients having MACEs (P=0.007). Over 4 to 14 hours, 661 patients had a hs-cTnT<14 ng\/L. Of those 661 patients, 413 (62.5%) patients had an m-HS\u22643, with 1 (0.2%) patient having a MACE, and 248 (37.5%) patients had an m-HS\u22654, with 5 (2.0%) patients having MACEs (P=0.03).\nSerial testing of hs-cTnT over 1 hour along with application of an m-HS identified a low-risk population that might be able to be directly discharged from the emergency department.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006ece","authors":["James McCord","Rafael Cabrera","Bertil Lindahl","Evangelos Giannitsis","Kaleigh Evans","Richard Nowak","Tiberio Frisoli","Richard Body","Michael Christ","Christopher R. deFilippi","Robert H.
