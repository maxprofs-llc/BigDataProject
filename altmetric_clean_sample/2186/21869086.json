The aim of the present study was to investigate whether this radiation dose causes late molecular alterations in endothelial cells that could support the population-based data.\nHuman coronary artery endothelial cells were irradiated at 0.5\u2009Gy (X-ray) and radiation-induced changes in the proteome were investigated after different time intervals (1, 7 and 14 d) using ICPL technology. Key changes identified by proteomics and bioinformatics were validated by immunoblotting and ELISA.\nThe radiation-induced alteration of the endothelial proteome was characterized by sustained perturbation of Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI) and nitric oxide (NO) signalling pathways. At later time-points, this was accompanied by reduced proteasome activity, enhanced protein carbonylation indicating augmented oxidative stress, and senescence.\nThese molecular changes are indicative of long-term premature endothelial dysfunction and provide a mechanistic framework to the epidemiological data showing increased risk of cardiovascular disease at 0.5\u2009Gy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003ea7","authors":["Omid Azimzadeh","Vikram Subramanian","Susanne St\u00e4nder","Juliane Merl-Pham","Donna Lowe","Zarko Barjaktarovic","Simone Moertl","Ken Raj","Michael J.
