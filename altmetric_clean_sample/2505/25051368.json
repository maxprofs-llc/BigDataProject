Combinations of artemisinin with other effective antimalarial drugs were available free of charge in public health centres, theoretically after a biological validation of the diagnosis of a malaria attack. Private pharmacies offered many products without medical prescription, most of them being ACT (Artemisinin Combined Therapy) but some being Artemisia derivatives alone. The cost of treatment for a presumptive attack varied from 14 to 44 \u20ac. The diversity of antimalarial drugs and of their dosages makes it difficult for sellers to provide appropriate recommendations for their use. In the informal sector, sellers offered the same products at similar prices as the formal sector but with the option of purchasing only a part of the treatment. Analgesics and herbal medicine not validated as antimalarial drugs were also available.","authors":["Muila, M","Gazin, P"],"doi":"10.1007\/s13149-017-0569-7","first_seen_on":"2017-09-10T10:01:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0037-9085"],"journal":"Bulletin de la Societe de pathologie exotique (1990)","last_mentioned_on":1505037655,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28887771?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28887771","pubdate":"2017-09-08T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Antimalarial Drugs Available in the City Cabinda (Angola) in 2016.","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MalariaPapers\/statuses\/906819770871418880","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25051368],"posted_on":"2017-09-10T10:00:55+00:00","author":{"name":"Malaria Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/633328476070785024\/zGKHLt0g_normal.png","description":"I'm a bot tweeting papers about malaria as they appear on PubMed (& now preprints on BioRxiv). \n\nRun by @theosanderson.","id_on_source":"MalariaPapers","tweeter_id":"3428446343","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":140},"tweet_id":"906819770871418880"}]}}
