However, the mechanisms underlying these effects and how are they related to the clinical antidepressant efficacy are still poorly understood. We show here that chronic FLX administration decreases hippocampus-associated neophobia in na\u00efve mice. In parallel, electrophysiological recordings in hippocampal CA3-CA1 circuitry revealed that the FLX treatment resulted in increased short- and long-term plasticity likely attributed to changes in presynaptic function. These changes were accompanied by enhancement in the expression of proteins related to vesicular trafficking and release, namely synaptophysin, synaptotagmin 1, MUNC 18 and syntaxin 1. Thus, chronic FLX administration is associated with enhanced synaptic dynamics atypical of mature CA1 synapses, elevated hippocampal plasticity, improved hippocampus-dependent behavior as well as altered expression of synaptic proteins regulating neurotransmitter trafficking and release. The results support the idea that antidepressants can promote neuronal plasticity and show that they can increase the functional dynamic range and information processing in synaptic circuitries.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031a0","authors":["Popova Dina","Eero Castren","Tomi Taira"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neuropharm.2017.09.003","first_seen_on":"2017-09-10T12:45:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["00283908","1873-7064"],"journal":"Neuropharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1506283743,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28887184?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28887184?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=anxietynews","http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0028390817304215"],"pmid":"28887184","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology","pharmacology"],"title":"Chronic fluoxetine administration enhances synaptic plasticity and increases functional dynamics in hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chronic-fluoxetine-administration-enhances-synaptic-plasticity-increases-functional-dynamics-hippoca"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.75,"6m":1.75,"3m":1.75,"1m":1.75,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8461056,"mean":7.1082133466728,"rank":3900989,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4475059,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8461056,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":158531,"mean":11.967995609664,"rank":67193,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":88676,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":158531,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2050,"mean":5.3823123474866,"rank":1080,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":956,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2050,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":2.3606086956522,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Neuroscience":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"FI":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SynapsePapers\/statuses\/906861092994826240","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25058750],"posted_on":"2017-09-10T12:45:07+00:00","author":{"name":"SynapsePapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/566055028952018944\/nOqlF7Cg_normal.png","description":"Twitterbot bringing you new papers on neuronal synapses.
