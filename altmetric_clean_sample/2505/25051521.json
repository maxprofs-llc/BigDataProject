However, limited reports are available on systematic optimization of carbonization degree. In this investigation, pyrolysis temperatures between 160\u2009\u00b0C and 220\u2009\u00b0C were studied, based on CA thermal decomposition path, using various heating durations. The effect of the formation of more carbonized carbon particles (MCCPs), as the major byproduct of this method, on photoluminescence properties of CDs was also considered. The NaOH amount that neutralizes the solution and the effect of dilution on the emission intensity, were introduced as simple and accessible factors for monitoring carbonization degree, and an estimate of MCCP\/CD ratio, respectively. The results show that the CDs fabricated at 160\u2009\u00b0C, 50\u2009minutes attain almost twice higher quantum yield (QY) of 29% than highest QY reported based on pyrolysis of CA. The so-prepared CDs can be employed as excellent candidates for turn-off sensing. As a proof of concept, detection limit of 50\u2009nM for Hg(2+) was achieved using a facile and inexpensive smartphone set-up that is able to quantify and compare fluorescent intensity in several samples simultaneously.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Zeinab Bagheri","Hamide Ehtesabi","Moones Rahmandoust","Mohammad Mahdi Ahadian","Zahra Hallaji","Farzaneh Eskandari","Effat Jokar"],"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-017-11572-8","first_seen_on":"2017-09-10T10:04:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2045-2322"],"issue":"1","journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1505056895,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28887498?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28887498","pubdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["science"],"title":"New Insight into the Concept of Carbonization Degree in Synthesis of Carbon Dots to Achieve Facile Smartphone Based Sensing Platform","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-insight-concept-carbonization-degree-synthesis-carbon-dots-achieve-facile-smartphone-based-sensi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":1.5,"1m":1.5,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8392422,"mean":7.0682902969164,"rank":3984619,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4221626,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8392422,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121361,"mean":11.803938052077,"rank":53929,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":63746,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121361,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37279,"mean":14.714110413649,"rank":18161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":17927,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37279,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2555,"mean":11.540133124511,"rank":1211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":1274,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2555,"percentile":49}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1,"NL":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/doctick\/statuses\/906820644427505665","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25051521],"posted_on":"2017-09-10T10:04:24+00:00","author":{"name":"doctick","url":"http:\/\/doctick.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/502911606083166208\/Mo60jRB-_normal.png","description":"Working on medical online calculators and automated notification systems for science articles & #healtcareIT trends...","id_on_source":"doctick","tweeter_id":"2295768584","geo":{"lt":41.38879,"ln":2.15899,"country":"ES"},"followers":252},"tweet_id":"906820644427505665"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/caring_mobile\/statuses\/906821415076352000","license":"gnip","rt":["doctick"],"citation_ids":[25051521],"posted_on":"2017-09-10T10:07:27+00:00","author":{"name":"CareMo","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/727239253529350144\/Syga1r2Z_normal.jpg","description":"We want you to find the best digital health strategy!
