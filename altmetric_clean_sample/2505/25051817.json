Because multiresistant bacteria are becoming an increasing issue in medical care of chronic diseases, it is important to develop appropriate therapeutic management for acute and chronic dermatoses. The current discussion about the skin microbiota shows the importance of preserving the resident skin flora. There is a\u00a0need for alternatives to topical antibiotics, e.\u2009g. topical antiseptics, which should be safe, fast, and effective but not allergenic or toxic. Even with frequent and prolonged application it is important that they do not develop a\u00a0resistance. This article focusses on the use of antiseptics for medical indications. Mechanisms of action, tolerability, maximum concentrations, and possible contraindications are discussed and examples of extemporaneous antiseptic preparations are provided.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61a3cf058f6100075db","authors":["Staubach, P","Melhorn, S"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00105-017-4033-1","first_seen_on":"2017-09-10T10:12:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1432-1173"],"journal":"Der Hautarzt","last_mentioned_on":1505040479,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28887578?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28887578","pubdate":"2017-09-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"[Topical antiseptic agents].","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":2.25,"6m":2.25,"3m":2.25,"1m":2.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8392422,"mean":7.0682902969164,"rank":3543265,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4795567,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8392422,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121359,"mean":11.804064602251,"rank":43882,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":76163,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121359,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233,"mean":2.6193275862069,"rank":77,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":153,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.0833333333333,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HostMicroPapers\/statuses\/906822699376304128","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25051817],"posted_on":"2017-09-10T10:12:34+00:00","author":{"name":"HKAHostMicroPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/727224114998448128\/cO-ng_II_normal.jpg","description":"Tweets of new microbiome papers as they appear on pubmed. @HollyKArnold","id_on_source":"HostMicroPapers","tweeter_id":"726591212560355328","geo":{"lt":44.56457,"ln":-123.26204,"country":"US"},"followers":24},"tweet_id":"906822699376304128"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Symbiosispapers\/statuses\/906823221340545024","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25051817],"posted_on":"2017-09-10T10:14:38+00:00","author":{"name":"Symbiosis papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/471619200876687360\/8YeaykyW_normal.jpeg","description":"RSS feed of new symbiosis- and microbiome-related papers in PubMed.
