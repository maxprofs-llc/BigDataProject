The relationship among traumatic exposure, PTSD, and excessive drinking is well documented; however, little is known about these relationships in the long term. This study examines factors increasing binge drinking risk among exposed individuals a decade post-9\/11.\nIn 2015-2016, data were analyzed from 28,592 World Trade Center Health Registry enrollees aged \u226518 years who completed the Wave 3 (2011-2012) survey. Women comprised 38.9% of participants. Binge drinking in the last 30 days was categorized as low (men, five to seven drinks; women, four to six drinks) or high intensity (men, eight or more drinks; women, seven or more drinks). Probable 9\/11-related PTSD was defined as scoring \u226544 on the PTSD Checklist. Exposures to 9\/11 (e.g., witnessing horror, sustaining an injury) were categorized as none\/low (zero to two) or high (three or more).\nBinge drinking was reported by 24.7% of participants, of whom 36.9% reported high-intensity binge drinking. Compared with non-binge drinkers, the odds of low- and high-intensity binge drinking were greater among enrollees who were male, aged 18-34 years, non-Hispanic white, had income >$75,000, were rescue\/recovery workers, had high 9\/11 exposure, or 9\/11-related PTSD.\nThe observed associations among traumatic exposure, PTSD, and excessive drinking underscore the need for improved therapies addressing excessive drinking and PTSD concurrently, inclusion of repeated post-event screening for excessive drinking, and evidence-based population-level interventions to reduce alcohol consumption.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002215","authors":["Welch, Alice E.","Caramanica Zweig, Kimberly","McAteer, Jonathan M.","Brackbill, Robert M."],"doi":"10.1016\/j.amepre.2016.10.034","endpage":"198","first_seen_on":"2017-01-19T09:22:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0749-3797","07493797","1873-2607"],"issue":"2","journal":"American Journal of Preventive Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1484817692,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0749379716305682"],"pmid":"28109459","pubdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"192","subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Intensity of Binge Drinking a Decade After the September 11th Terror Attacks Among Exposed Individuals","type":"article","volume":"52","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intensity-binge-drinking-decade-after-september-11th-terror-attacks-among-exposed-individuals"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8083793,"mean":6.8666882938024,"rank":6137588,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1086401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8083793,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259244,"mean":12.827632013207,"rank":186732,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":45045,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259244,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2666,"mean":22.573503939962,"rank":2462,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":78,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2666,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123,"mean":44.642967213115,"rank":119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/profhrs\/statuses\/822011097540685824","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15581320],"posted_on":"2017-01-19T09:21:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Harry Sumnall","url":"http:\/\/www.cph.org.uk\/people\/harrysumnall\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/904607436434178048\/9FBWb6hc_normal.jpg","description":"Professor @PHI_Research, @LJMU; ACMD member; Board Member @euspr; Trustee @mentortweets.
