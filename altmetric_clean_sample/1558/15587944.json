Although there are standard treatments for pancreatic AC, no precise therapies exist for pancreatic SCC. Here, we screened 1033 cases of pancreatic cancer and identified 2 cases of pure SCC, which were pathologically diagnosed on the basis of finding definite intercellular bridges and\/or focal keratin peal formation in the tumor cells. Immunohistochemistry assay confirmed the positive expression of CK5\/6 and p63 in pancreatic SCC. To verify the genomic characteristics of pancreatic SCC, we employed in-solution hybrid capture targeting 137 cancer-related genes accompanied by high throughput sequencing (HTS) to compare the different genetic variants in SCC and AC of pancreas. We compared the genetic alterations of known biomarkers of pancreatic adenocarcinoma in different pancreatic cancer tissues, and identified nine mutated genes in SCC of pancreas: C7orf70, DNHD1, KPRP, MDM4, MUC6, OR51Q1, PTPRD, TCF4, TET2, and nine genes (ABCB1, CSF1R, CYP2C18, FBXW7, ITPA, KIAA0748, SOD2, SULT1A2, ZNF142) that are mutated in pancreatic AC. This study may have taken one step forward on the discovery of potential biomarkers for the targeted treatment of SCC of the pancreas.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Xu, Meng-Dan","Liu, Shu-Ling","Feng, Yi-Zhong","Liu, Qiang","Shen, Meng","Zhi, Qiaoming","Liu, Zeyi","Gu, Dong-Mei","Yu, Jie","Shou, Liu-Mei","Gong, Fei-Ran","Zhu, Qi","Duan, Weiming","Chen, Kai","Zhang, Junning","Wu, Meng-Yao","Tao, Min","Li, Wei","Meng-Dan Xu","Shu-Ling Liu","Yi-Zhong Feng","Qiang Liu","Meng Shen","Qiaoming Zhi","Zeyi Liu","Dong-Mei Gu","Jie Yu","Liu-Mei Shou","Fei-Ran Gong","Qi Zhu","Weiming Duan","Kai Chen","Junning Zhang","Meng-Yao Wu","Min Tao","Wei Li"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.14678","first_seen_on":"2017-01-19T14:30:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1503676444,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28099906","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28099906?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28099906","pubdate":"2017-01-16T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Genomic characteristics of pancreatic squamous cell carcinoma, an investigation by using high throughput sequencing after in-solution hybrid capture","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genomic-characteristics-pancreatic-squamous-cell-carcinoma-investigation-using-high-throughput-seque"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8425604,"mean":7.0878923279354,"rank":2164542,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5111542,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8425604,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280960,"mean":12.489735648261,"rank":96627,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":179381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280960,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8945,"mean":3.2147665474061,"rank":960,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7880,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8945,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":379,"mean":12.180439153439,"rank":122,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":256,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":379,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"JP":1,"ME":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/5hmC_papers\/statuses\/822088835802595329","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15587944],"posted_on":"2017-01-19T14:30:26+00:00","author":{"name":"5hmCpapers","url":"http:\/\/github.com\/pmcarlton\/pubmed-rss-twitter","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/520465276567949312\/ssHzUg9A_normal.png","description":"Papers related to the covalent DNA modification 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, from pubmed and bioR\u03c7iv","id_on_source":"5hmC_papers","tweeter_id":"2849780190","geo":{"lt":35.02107,"ln":135.75385,"country":"JP"},"followers":63},"tweet_id":"822088835802595329"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OncotargetACD\/statuses\/822358685691314178","license":"gnip","rt":["5hmC_papers"],"citation_ids":[15587944],"posted_on":"2017-01-20T08:22:44+00:00","author":{"name":"Oncotarget ACD","url":"http:\/\/www.impactjournals.com\/oncotarget\/index.php?journal=oncotarget&page=pages&op=view&path%5B%5D=","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/897050007932723201\/5tB9mCZx_normal.jpg","description":"This section of Oncotarget deals with the latest developments in Autophagy and Cell Death Research, not necessarily related to oncology.","id_on_source":"OncotargetACD","tweeter_id":"3400234997","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":4421},"tweet_id":"822358685691314178"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerWallonia\/statuses\/822369781269467136","license":"gnip","rt":["5hmC_papers"],"citation_ids":[15587944],"posted_on":"2017-01-20T09:06:49+00:00","author":{"name":"CancerWallonia","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/623178120615604224\/unGEOij0_normal.jpg","description":"Cancer: from Wallonia to the World, from the World to Wallonia -
