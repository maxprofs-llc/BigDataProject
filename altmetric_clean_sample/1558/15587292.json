We have considered several sets of protein pairs from S. cerevisiae with no functional interaction reported, denoted as non-interacting pairs, and compared their 3D structures to available experimental complexes. We identified some non-interacting pairs with significant structural similarity with experimental complexes, indicating that, even though they do not form functional interactions, they have compatible structures. We estimate that up to 8.7% of non-interacting protein pairs could have compatible structures. This number of interactions exceeds the number of functional interactions (around 0.2% of the total interactions) by a factor 40. Network analysis suggests that the interactions formed by non-interacting pairs with compatible structures could be particularly hazardous to the protein-protein interaction network. From a structural point of view, these interactions display no aberrant structural characteristics, and are even predicted as relatively stable and enriched in potential physical interactors, suggesting a major role of regulation to prevent them.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Guillaume Launay","Nicoletta Ceres","Juliette Martin"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep40419","first_seen_on":"2017-01-19T13:55:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1486596452,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep40419","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/srep40419","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1038\/srep40419"],"pmid":"28084410","pubdate":"2017-01-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Protein function predictions","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Protein structure predictions","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"40419","subjects":["science"],"title":"Non-interacting proteins may resemble interacting proteins: prevalence and implications","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep40419","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/noninteracting-proteins-resemble-interacting-proteins-prevalence-implications"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":2.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8177609,"mean":6.9186386481167,"rank":3424322,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4701687,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8177609,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":265136,"mean":12.747003843325,"rank":108686,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":154039,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":265136,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34330,"mean":14.894473768534,"rank":14099,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":19785,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34330,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3152,"mean":16.168596001269,"rank":1426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":1690,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3152,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
