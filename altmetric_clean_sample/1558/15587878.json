Virtual screening led to the discovery of new hits that interact with Bcl-2 at the BH3 binding pocket. Further study of the structure-activity relationship of the most active compound of the first series, compound 1, led to the discovery of a novel oxadiazole analogue, compound 16j, that was a more potent small molecule inhibitor of Bcl-2. 16j had good in vitro inhibitory activity with sub-micromolar IC50 values in a metastatic human breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231) and a human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa). The antitumour effect of 16j is concomitant with its ability to bind to Bcl-2 protein as shown by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (IC50 = 4.27 \u03bcM). Compound 16j has a great potential to develop into highly active anticancer agent. This article is protected by copyright.
