Twenty-four adults with a moderate-severe TBI accessing a community brain injury rehabilitation service were recruited. Age ranged between 19 and 69 years. Participants completed a battery of neuropsychological tasks assessing memory, executive functioning, and speed of information processing. Self-report questionnaires assessing obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) traits were also completed. Correlational analyses revealed that deficits in cognitive flexibility were associated with greater self-reported OC symptomatology and severity. Greater OC symptom severity was significantly related to poorer performance on a visual memory task. Verbal memory and speed of information processing impairments were unrelated to OC symptoms. Performance on tasks of memory, executive functioning, and speed of information processing were not associated with OCPD traits. Overall, results indicate that greater OC symptomatology and severity were associated with specific neuropsychological functions (i.e., cognitive flexibility, visual memory). OCPD personality traits were unrelated to cognitive performance. Further research is needed to examine the potential causal relationship and longer-term interactions between cognitive sequelae and obsessive-compulsive spectrum presentations post-TBI.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f61000148a","authors":["Michelle Rydon-Grange","Rudi Coetzer"],"doi":"10.1080\/09602011.2016.1272469","endpage":"18","first_seen_on":"2017-01-19T09:29:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0960-2011","1464-0694"],"journal":"Neuropsychological Rehabilitation","last_mentioned_on":1484818167,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/09602011.2016.1272469"],"pmid":"28043199","pubdate":"2017-01-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine","psychology","neurology"],"title":"Association between cognitive impairments and obsessive-compulsive spectrum presentations following traumatic brain injury","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/09602011.2016.1272469","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-between-cognitive-impairments-obsessivecompulsive-spectrum-presentations-following-traum"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8083793,"mean":6.8666882938024,"rank":6137588,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1086401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8083793,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259245,"mean":12.827586389656,"rank":186733,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":45045,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259245,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":311,"mean":4.7508064516129,"rank":229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":311,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":31.1,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
