The mean baseline DLQI score was 5.1 (SD 4.2). The Effect Size in the responder group 'Highly Improved' was 0.66; in group 'Improved' 0.62 and 0.23 in group 'Unchanged'. At the end of study, the mean DLQI score ranged from 1.1 (SD 1.5) in the 'Highly Improved' group to 3.7 (SD 6.0) in the 'Unchanged' group.\nThe results support the sensitivity to change of the DLQI in this population.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f63","authors":["Richter, C","Trojahn, C","Hillmann, K","Dobos, G","Kanti, V","Vogt, A","Blume-Peytavi, U","Kottner, J","C.
