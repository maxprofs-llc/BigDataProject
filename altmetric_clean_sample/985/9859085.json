Without effective antiviral therapies or vaccines, these viruses pose serious public health and biodefense concerns. Chemically distinct small-molecule inhibitors of arenavirus entry have recently been identified and shown to act on the arenavirus envelope glycoprotein (GPC) to prevent membrane fusion. In the tripartite GPC complex, pH-dependent membrane fusion is triggered through a poorly understood interaction between the stable signal peptide (SSP) and the transmembrane fusion subunit GP2, and our genetic studies have suggested that these small-molecule inhibitors act at this interface to antagonize fusion activation. Here, we have designed and synthesized photoaffinity derivatives of the 4-acyl-1,6-dialkylpiperazin-2-one class of fusion inhibitors and demonstrate specific labeling of both the SSP and GP2 subunits in a native-like Lassa virus (LASV) GPC trimer expressed in insect cells. Photoaddition is competed by the parental inhibitor and other chemically distinct compounds active against LASV, but not those specific to New World arenaviruses. These studies provide direct physical evidence that these inhibitors bind at the SSP-GP2 interface. We also find that GPC containing the uncleaved GP1-GP2 precursor is not susceptible to photocrosslinking, suggesting that proteolytic maturation is accompanied by conformational changes at this site. Detailed mapping of residues modified by the photoaffinity adducts may provide insight to guide the further development of these promising lead compounds as potential therapeutic agents to treat Lassa hemorrhagic fever.\nHemorrhagic fever arenaviruses cause lethal infections in humans and, in the absence of licensed vaccines or specific antiviral therapies, are recognized to pose significant threats to public health and biodefense. Lead small-molecule inhibitors that target the arenavirus envelope glycoprotein (GPC) have recently been identified and shown to block GPC-mediated fusion of the viral and cellular endosomal membranes, thereby preventing virus entry into the host cell. Genetic studies suggest that these inhibitors act through a unique pH-sensing intersubunit interface in GPC, but atomic-level structural information is unavailable. In this report, we utilize novel photoreactive fusion inhibitors and photoaffinity labeling to obtain direct physical evidence for inhibitor binding at this critical interface in Lassa virus GPC. Future identification of modified residues at the inhibitor-binding site will help elucidate the molecular basis for fusion activation and its inhibition, and guide the development of effective therapies to treat arenaviral hemorrhagic fevers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f92","authors":["Sundaresh Shankar","Landon R.
