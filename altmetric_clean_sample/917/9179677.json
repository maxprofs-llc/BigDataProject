Although some clinical trials of limited resection for lung cancer have started, it will take a long time before the results will be published. We have already reported a large-scale study of limited resection. We herein report the data for a subclass analysis according to differences in pathology.\nData from multiple institutions were collected on 1710 patients who had undergone limited resection (segmentectomy or wedge resection) for cT1N0M0 non-small cell carcinoma. The disease-free survival (DFS) and recurrence-free proportion (RFP) were analyzed. Small cell carcinomas and carcinoid tumors were excluded from this analysis. Adenocarcinomas were sub-classified into four groups using two factors, the ratio of consolidation to the tumor diameter (C\/T) and the tumor diameter alone.\nThe median patient age was 64 (20-75) years old. The mean maximal diameter of the tumors was 1.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0cm. The DFS and RFP at 5\u00a0years based on the pathology were 92.2 and 94.7\u00a0% in adenocarcinoma (n\u00a0=\u00a01575), 76.3 and 82.4\u00a0% in squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) (n\u00a0=\u00a0100), and 73.6 and 75.9\u00a0% in patients with other tumors (n\u00a0=\u00a035). The prognosis of adenocarcinoma in both groups A (C\/T \u22640.25 and tumor diameter \u22642.0\u00a0cm) and B (C\/T \u22640.25 and tumor diameter >2.0\u00a0cm) was good. In SqCC, only segmentectomy was a favorable prognostic factor. In the groups with other pathologies, large cell carcinomas were worse in prognosis (the both DFS and RFP: 46.3\u00a0%).\nKnowing the pathological diagnosis is important to determine the indications for limited resection. Measurement of the tumor diameter and C\/T was useful to determine the indications for limited resection for adenocarcinoma. Limited resection for adenocarcinomas is similar with a larger resection, while the technique should be performed with caution in squamous cell carcinoma and other pathologies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f610003741","authors":["Yano, Motoki","Yoshida, Junji","Koike, Terumoto","Kameyama, Kotaro","Shimamoto, Akira","Nishio, Wataru","Yoshimoto, Kentaro","Utsumi, Tomoki","Shiina, Takayuki","Watanabe, Atsushi","Yamato, Yasushi","Watanabe, Takehiro","Takahashi, Yusuke","Sonobe, Makoto","Kuroda, Hiroaki","Oda, Makoto","Inoue, Masayoshi","Tanahashi, Masayuki","Adachi, Hirofumi","Saito, Masao","Hayashi, Masataro","Otsuka, Hajime","Mizobuchi, Teruaki","Moriya, Yasumitsu","Takahashi, Mamoru","Nishikawa, Shigeto","Matsumura, Yuki","Moriyama, Satoru","Fujii, Yoshitaka"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00268-016-3596-9","first_seen_on":"2016-07-02T20:59:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-2323","0364-2313"],"issue":"11","journal":"World Journal of Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1467454149,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27365098?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27365098","pubdate":"2016-06-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Abdominal Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cardiac Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"General Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Thoracic Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Vascular Surgery","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"The Outcomes of a Limited Resection for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer\u00a0Based on Differences in Pathology","type":"article","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/outcomes-limited-resection-nonsmall-cell-lung-cancerbased-differences-pathology"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7976486,"mean":6.7343932358615,"rank":6902151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7976486,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260708,"mean":11.506228309941,"rank":218875,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260708,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2356,"mean":3.3944959660297,"rank":1557,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2356,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93,"mean":4.7528260869565,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/statuses\/749183119924748288","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9179677],"posted_on":"2016-07-02T10:09:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":439},"tweet_id":"749183119924748288"}]}}
