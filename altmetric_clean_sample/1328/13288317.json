The potential underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood.\nOf 244 patients treated with SAPIEN 3,208 without a previous pacemaker and 184 without baseline CA were analyzed. We assessed the association of angiographic implantation depth (% of frame height below the annulus) and degree of oversizing with PPI and CA.\nNew PPI and new or worsened CA or PPI occurred in 16% (34 of 208) and 31% (57 of 184), respectively. Patients requiring PPI had a higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation (44% vs. 24%; p\u00a0= 0.017), complete right bundle branch block (27% vs. 5%; p\u00a0= 0.001), and bradycardia (<60 beats\/min, 38% vs. 21%; p\u00a0= 0.034). In patients with new CA or PPI, implantation depth was lower (at septal side: 29 \u00b1 8% vs. 25 \u00b1 7%; p\u00a0= 0.003), and rate of oversizing was higher (19% [11 of 57] vs. 6% [8 of 126]; p\u00a0= 0.007). Independent predictors of new or worsened CA or PPI were implantation depth at septal side (odds ratio [OR]: 1.063 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.017 to 1.110]; p\u00a0= 0.006 per %\u00a0of frame below the aortic annulus), oversizing (OR: 3.489 [95% CI: 1.236 to 9.848]; p\u00a0= 0.018), and QRS duration (OR:\u00a01.033 [95% CI: 1.011 to 1.056]; p\u00a0= 0.003 per ms).\nImplantation depth and prosthesis oversizing were associated with a higher rate of new CA or PPI using the SAPIEN 3. Thus, avoidance of deep implantation and extreme oversizing may reduce these complications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007acb","authors":["Oliver Husser","Costanza Pellegrini","Thorsten Kessler","Christof Burgdorf","Hannah Thaller","N.
