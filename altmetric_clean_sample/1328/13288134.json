The lesions were evaluated to determine if distinctive patterns could be identified in correlation with lesion grade.\nFifty seven (n=57) consecutive DIN cases were investigated. Of these, 15 qualified as DIN1c, 28 as DIN2 and 14 as DIN3. The patterns of distribution were recorded for each case as either basal\/peripheral or haphazard within the epithelial proliferation.\nThere was a statistically significant difference between the DIN1c, DIN2 and DIN3 in terms of basal\/peripheral versus haphazard distribution of Ki67 immunostaining (Chi-square test, P<0.0001). Basal\/peripheral staining pattern was dominant among the DIN1c cases, while haphazard staining pattern was the dominant distribution among the DIN3 cases. One half of the DIN2 cases showed basal\/peripheral staining pattern, while the other half showed a haphazard staining pattern.\nHigh grade DIN lesions show haphazard Ki67 staining while low grade DIN lesions show basal\/peripheral Ki67 staining in the proliferating epithelial cells. This feature could be practical in separating DIN lesions into low grade (basal\/peripheral-Ki67) and high grade (haphazard-Ki67) eliminating the grade 2\/intermediate category.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f61000329d","authors":["Ozerdem, Ugur","Tavassoli, Fattaneh A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.prp.2016.07.005","endpage":"875","first_seen_on":"2016-11-02T21:43:00+00:00","issns":["1618-0631","03440338"],"issue":"10","journal":"Pathology - Research & Practice","last_mentioned_on":1478122966,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0344033816302400?_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_origin=gateway&_docanchor&md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb"],"pmid":"27499154","pubdate":"2016-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"872","subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Distribution pattern of Ki67 immunoreactivity in ductal intraepithelial neoplasia: Correlation with lesion grade and potential utility","type":"article","volume":"212"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7632130,"mean":6.5668397124796,"rank":6605662,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7632130,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233453,"mean":12.787457652965,"rank":189552,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233453,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":361,"mean":1.8246,"rank":257,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":361,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":4.3704545454545,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"MX":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/memoalexlope\/statuses\/793931379264274432","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13288134],"posted_on":"2016-11-02T21:42:46+00:00","author":{"name":"Guillermo Lopez C","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1511285875\/45150_485611673153_796953153_6804721_3991610_n_normal.jpg","description":"M\u00e9dico Anatomopatologo.
