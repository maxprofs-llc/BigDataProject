Currently, no validated comprehensive monitoring tool exists that can support introduction and further implementation of BL in a higher education context.\nStarting from established evaluation principles and standards, concepts that were to be evaluated were firstly identified and grouped. In a second step, related BL evaluation tools referring to students, faculty and institutional level were selected. This allowed setting up and implementing an evaluation framework to monitor the introduction of BL during two succeeding recurrences of the program.\nThe results of the evaluation allowed documenting strengths and weaknesses of the BL format in a comprehensive way, involving all actors. It has led to improvements at program, faculty and course level. The evaluation process and the reporting of the results proved to be demanding in time and personal resources.\nThe evaluation framework allows measuring the most significant dimensions influencing the success of a BL implementation at program level. However, this comprehensive evaluation is resource intensive. Further steps will be to refine the framework towards a sustainable and transferable BL monitoring tool that finds a balance between comprehensiveness and efficiency.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b83","authors":["Aviva S.Chmiel","Maya Shaha","Daniel Schneider"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.nedt.2016.10.008","first_seen_on":"2016-11-02T20:08:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["02606917","1532-2793"],"journal":"Nurse Education Today","last_mentioned_on":1478523993,"links":["http:\/\/www.nurseeducationtoday.com\/article\/S0260-6917(16)30237-4\/fulltext"],"pmid":"27835823","pubdate":"2016-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing","education"],"title":"Introduction of Blended Learning in a Master Program: Developing an Integrative Mixed Method Evaluation Framework","type":"article","volume":"48","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/introduction-blended-learning-master-program-developing-integrative-mixed-method-evaluation-framewor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.55,"score_history":{"1y":3.55,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7659635,"mean":6.5812991774756,"rank":1713589,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":5936635,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7659635,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233955,"mean":12.801936799542,"rank":74515,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":158950,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233955,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":876,"mean":3.68672,"rank":232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":637,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":876,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":6.1391891891892,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
