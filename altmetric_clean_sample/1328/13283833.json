Peripheral B cells, however, are not always easy to obtain and only represent a small percentage of the total B cell population across all bodily tissues. Although it has been demonstrated that tandem mass spectrometry (MS\/MS) techniques can interrogate the expressed polyclonal antibody (pAb) response to an antigen in vivo, all current approaches identify MS\/MS spectra against databases derived from genetic sequencing of B cells from the same patient. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate the feasibility of a novel MS\/MS antibody discovery approach in which only serum antibodies are required, without the need for sequencing of genetic material. Peripheral pAbs from a CMV exposed individual were purified by glycoprotein B antigen-affinity and de novo sequenced from MS\/MS data. Purely MS-derived mAbs were then manufactured in mammalian cells to validate potency via antigen-binding ELISA. Interestingly, we found that these mAbs accounted for 1-2% of total donor IgG but were not detected in parallel sequencing of memory B cells from the same patient.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e0f","authors":["Adrian Guthals"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jproteome.6b00608","first_seen_on":"2016-11-02T17:21:27+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms"],"issns":["1535-3907","1535-3893"],"journal":"Journal of Proteome Research","last_mentioned_on":1486843250,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jproteome.6b00608","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jproteome.6b00608#.WC3gNVbhxc4.twitter"],"pmid":"27779884","pubdate":"2016-11-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"De Novo MS\/MS Sequencing of Native Human Antibodies","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novo-msms-sequencing-native-human-antibodies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.85,"score_history":{"1y":4.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8192854,"mean":6.9262032168704,"rank":1653024,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6530335,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8192854,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240958,"mean":13.042517386919,"rank":68117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":172492,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240958,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2875,"mean":3.8293980514962,"rank":410,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":2462,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2875,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110,"mean":5.2302752293578,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":92,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
