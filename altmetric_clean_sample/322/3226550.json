In Studies 1 and 2, AP was correlated with D-PFCA (r=.37, p<.01, and r=.33, p<.01, respectively), IQ (r=.24, p<.05, and r=.38, p<.01, respectively), and Conscientiousness (r=.26, p<.05, and r=.37, p<.01, respectively). D-PFCA remained significant in regression analyses controlling for intelligence (or g) and personality. Studies 3 and 4 assessed D-PFCA, personality, and workplace performance among (a) managerial-administrative workers and (b) factory floor workers at a manufacturing company. Prefrontal cognitive ability correlated with supervisor ratings of manager performance at values of r ranging from .42 to .57 (ps<.001), depending on experience, and with factory floor performance at pr=.21 (p=.02), after controlling for experience, age, and education. Conscientiousness correlated with factory floor performance at r=.23.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037a6","authors":["Higgins DM","Peterson JB","Pihl RO","Lee AG"],"doi":"10.1037\/0022-3514.93.2.298","endpage":"319","first_seen_on":"2015-02-02T10:26:17+00:00","issns":["0022-3514","1939-1315"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Personality & Social Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1472472872,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1037\/0022-3514.93.2.298","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1037%2F0022-3514.93.2.298"],"pmid":"17645401","pubdate":"2007-07-24T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Marketing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"298","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Prefrontal cognitive ability, intelligence, Big Five personality, and the prediction of advanced academic and workplace performance.","type":"article","volume":"93","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prefrontal-cognitive-ability-intelligence-big-five-personality-prediction-advanced-academic-workplac"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8296164,"mean":6.9911317525872,"rank":1207986,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":7013473,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8296164,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241095,"mean":8.3006531643259,"rank":41747,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":196874,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241095,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5932,"mean":10.30514550666,"rank":1378,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":4494,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5932,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":18.05555,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":14,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":11,"Researcher":21,"Student  > Ph.
