This study reports on education\/training of practicing nurses and explores some of the reasons for nurses reporting feelings of discomfort with LGBT patient care. Transcripts from structured interviews with 268 nurses in the San Francisco Bay Area revealed that 80% had no education or training on LGBT issues. Although most said they were comfortable with LGBT patient care, some of their comments indicated that they might not be providing culturally sensitive care. Implications for nursing education and for policies and procedures of health care institutions are addressed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a94","authors":["Carabez, Rebecca","Pellegrini, Marion","Mankovitz, Andrea","Eliason, Mickey","Ciano, Mark","Scott, Megan"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.profnurs.2015.01.003","first_seen_on":"2015-02-01T02:16:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["8755-7223","1532-8481"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Professional Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1437580626,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=7&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.professionalnursing.org%2Farticle%2FS8755-7223%252815%252900004-6%2Fabstract&code=yjpnu-site","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26194964"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.professionalnursing.org\/article\/S8755722315000046\/pdf","pmid":"26194964","pubdate":"2015-07-22T15:57:30+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing"],"title":"\"Never in All My Years\u2026\": Nurses' Education About LGBT Health.","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/never-years-nurses-education-about-lgbt-health"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5387375,"mean":6.293258888655,"rank":2486174,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2766078,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5387375,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":188044,"mean":8.6830716804136,"rank":81098,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":101107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":188044,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105,"mean":2.0329230769231,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":64,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.6,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
