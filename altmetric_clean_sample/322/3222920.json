We retrospectively analyzed the characteristics and outcomes of 49 patients with AHA diagnosed in our center from February 1994 to October 2012. Twenty-four patients with acute bleeding episodes were treated with prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) at a relative low dose of 30 to -50 U\/kg\/d and achieved good outcomes without any adverse reaction. Corticosteroids alone or in combination with cyclophosphamide were used as the first-line therapy to eradicate the inhibitors. In 39 evaluable patients, 35 (89.7%) achieved complete remission (CR). This study demonstrates that when bypassing agents such as recombinant activated factor VII and activated PCCs are not affordable or available, low dose PCC is effective and safe to control acute bleeding in patients with AHA. First-line therapy achieved good outcomes with a CR rate of 89.7%.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006ef0","authors":["Yanhui Yang","Feng Xue","Hao Shi","Hongmei Wang","Lei Zhang","Linxiang Ji","Renchi Yang"],"doi":"10.1177\/1076029613488937","endpage":"40","first_seen_on":"2015-02-01T10:30:27+00:00","issns":["1938-2723","1076-0296"],"issue":"1","journal":"Clinical and Applied Thrombosis\/Hemostasis","last_mentioned_on":1422786612,"links":["http:\/\/cat.sagepub.com\/content\/21\/1\/35.abstract?hootPostID=412fd380ad3b8a19647e0247170ecdbc"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/cat.sagepub.com\/content\/21\/1\/35.full.pdf","pmid":"23677912","pubdate":"2013-05-13T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"35","title":"Acquired Hemophilia A Retrospective Analysis of 49 Cases From a Single Chinese Hemophilia Center","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/acquired-hemophilia-retrospective-analysis-49-cases-single-chinese-hemophilia-center"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4698042,"mean":5.7124864691489,"rank":3935397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4698042,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164337,"mean":8.8069084193363,"rank":132148,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164337,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":162,"mean":1.8263354037267,"rank":116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":162,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.0875,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":4,"Student  > Bachelor":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":9,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SAGECardiology\/status\/561833892114878464","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3222920],"posted_on":"2015-02-01T10:30:12+00:00","author":{"name":"SAGECardiology","url":"http:\/\/www.sagepublications.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/718098214050639872\/kYxwfwlM_normal.jpg","description":"Follow us for the latest #cardiology and #cardiovascular disease research from SAGE Publishing, as well as general news items of interest.","id_on_source":"SAGECardiology","tweeter_id":"1464726582","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2138},"tweet_id":"561833892114878464"}]}}
