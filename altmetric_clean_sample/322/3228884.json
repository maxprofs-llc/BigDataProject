Three tetanization paradigms were used: a relatively weak protocol A (10 bursts of 15 biphasic pulses at 200 Hz; 10-s interburst interval; 0.2-ms pulse width per phase), a stronger protocol B (as protocol A but 20 bursts and 0.25-ms pulse width) and, as the strongest condition, protocol C (2 times protocol B; inter-tetanus interval: 5 min). All protocols led to robust late-LTP in control animals. Late- but not early-LTP was protein synthesis-dependent under all tetanization conditions as indicated by the absence of long-lasting LTP when the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin was applied before tetanization. Application of the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol before LTP induction prevented late-LTP when either protocol A or B but not when protocol C was used. Thus, repeated strong tetanization can compensate for the loss of beta-adrenergic receptor activation. We suggest that the results could provide a link to cellular mechanisms of memory consolidation in respect to the strength and relevance of the incoming sensory information during learning.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031aa","authors":["T Straube","J U Frey"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-02T11:42:38+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0306-4522"],"issue":"2","journal":"Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1176141433,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12770561"],"pmid":"12770561","pubdate":"2003-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Involvement of beta-adrenergic receptors in protein synthesis-dependent late long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus of freely moving rats: the critical role of the LTP induction strength.","type":"article","volume":"119","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/involvement-adrenergic-receptors-protein-synthesisdependent-late-longterm-potentiation-ltp-dentate-g"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633986,"mean":4.9208287981427,"rank":815890,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295997,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633986,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94751,"mean":8.1879110712403,"rank":24803,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68859,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94751,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1843,"mean":2.6741465798046,"rank":265,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":1140,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1843,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":2.0624367816092,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":76,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
