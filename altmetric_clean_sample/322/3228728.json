Here we present a novel application of filamentous bacteriophages (phages) as targeted drug carriers for the eradication of (pathogenic) bacteria. The phages are genetically modified to display a targeting moiety on their surface and are used to deliver a large payload of a cytotoxic drug to the target bacteria. The drug is linked to the phages by means of chemical conjugation through a labile linker subject to controlled release. In the conjugated state, the drug is in fact a prodrug devoid of cytotoxic activity and is activated following its dissociation from the phage at the target site in a temporally and spatially controlled manner. Our model target was Staphylococcus aureus, and the model drug was the antibiotic chloramphenicol. We demonstrated the potential of using filamentous phages as universal drug carriers for targetable cells involved in disease. Our approach replaces the selectivity of the drug itself with target selectivity borne by the targeting moiety, which may allow the reintroduction of nonspecific drugs that have thus far been excluded from antibacterial use (because of toxicity or low selectivity). Reintroduction of such drugs into the arsenal of useful tools may help to combat emerging bacterial antibiotic resistance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a6a","authors":["Iftach Yacoby","Marina Shamis","Hagit Bar","Doron Shabat","Itai Benhar"],"doi":"10.1128\/aac.00169-06","first_seen_on":"2015-02-02T11:38:13+00:00","issns":["1098-6596"],"journal":"Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1197607285,"links":["http:\/\/aac.asm.org\/cgi\/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16723570","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1128\/AAC.00169-06","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16723570","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1479106"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/aac.asm.org\/content\/50\/6\/2087.full.pdf","pmid":"16723570","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["drugtherapy"],"title":"Targeting Antibacterial Agents by Using Drug-Carrying Filamentous Bacteriophages","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/targeting-antibacterial-agents-using-drugcarrying-filamentous-bacteriophages"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629407,"mean":4.9349111287126,"rank":816496,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290096,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629407,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94117,"mean":8.121813761741,"rank":24511,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68521,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94117,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2632,"mean":3.056491068035,"rank":410,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":1777,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2632,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99,"mean":2.3678571428571,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":85,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":19,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
