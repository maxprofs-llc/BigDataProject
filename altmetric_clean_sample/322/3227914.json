Of the two, the former was by far the stronger in vitro promoter of stolon tuberization. Number of tubers induced per stolon, tuberization rate, and final tuber weight were higher by factors of 2.8, 2.3, and 6.4, respectively. Bioassay sensitivity of jasmonic acid, measured in terms of the point at which the concentration for inducing tuberization was saturating, was more than 20 times greater than that of kinetin. Tuberization in both cases was associated with a decrease in rooting ability. Jasmonic acid also triggered a general state of induction throughout the stolon.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000333b","authors":["Ana M. Pelacho","Angel M.
