Visualization during minimally invasive procedures has traditionally been obtained by the use of surgical telescopes, surgical microscopes, glass fibre endoscopes or a combination of these devices. All of these methods for visualization are less than fully satisfactory due to problems with access, magnification and blurred imaging.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d04","authors":["Harrel, Stephen K.","Wilson, Thomas G.","Rivera\u2010Hidalgo, Francisco"],"doi":"10.1111\/jcpe.12125","endpage":"874","first_seen_on":"2015-02-01T11:53:31+00:00","issns":["1600-051X","0303-6979"],"issue":"9","journal":"Journal of Clinical Periodontology","last_mentioned_on":1422791586,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jcpe.12125\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jcpe.12125\/pdf","pmid":"23782239","pubdate":"2013-06-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"868","subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"A videoscope for use in minimally invasive periodontal surgery","type":"article","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/videoscope-minimally-invasive-periodontal-surgery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6349146,"mean":5.980932373414,"rank":5405458,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6349146,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197865,"mean":8.4790657926657,"rank":156770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197865,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":533,"mean":4.3900112781955,"rank":472,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":533,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":17.99375,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
