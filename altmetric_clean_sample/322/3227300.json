The resulting phylogenetic tree shows that the most basal species is D. aeneus, followed in the tree by a trichotomy including (1) the Asian D. remifer, (2) a clade of all African and Indian Ocean islands species as well as two Asian species (D. macrocercus and D. leucophaeus) and (3) a clade that includes all other Asian species as well as two Australasian species (D. megarhynchus and D. bracteatus). Our phylogenetic hypotheses are compared to [Mayr, E., Vaurie, C., 1948. Evolution of the family Dicruridae (Birds). Evolution 2, 238-265.] hypothetical family \"tree\" based on traditional phenotypic analysis and biogeography. We point out a general discrepancy between the so-called \"primitive\" or \"unspecialized\" species and their position in the phylogenetic tree, although our results for other species are congruent with previous hypotheses. We conduct dating analyses using a relaxed-clock method, and propose a chronology of clades formation. A particular attention is given to the drongo radiation in Indian Ocean islands and to the extinction-invasion processes involved. The first large diversification of the family took place both in Asia and Africa at 11.9 and 13.3Myr, respectively, followed by a dispersal event from Africa to Asia at ca 10.6Myr; dispersal over Wallace line occurred later at ca 6Myr. At 5Myr, Principe and Indian Ocean Islands have been colonized from an African ancestor; the most recent colonization event concerned Anjouan by an immigrating population from Madagascar.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5083cf058f61000311a","authors":["Pasquet E","Pons JM","Fuchs J","Cruaud C","Bretagnolle V"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ympev.2007.03.010","first_seen_on":"2015-02-02T10:51:14+00:00","issns":["1055-7903"],"issue":"1","journal":"Molecular Phylogenetics & Evolution","last_mentioned_on":1450720123,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ympev.2007.03.010","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17468015"],"pmid":"17468015","pubdate":"2007-05-01T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biology"],"title":"Evolutionary history and biogeography of the drongos (Dicruridae), a tropical Old World clade of corvoid passerines.","type":"article","volume":"45","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evolutionary-history-biogeography-drongos-dicruridae-tropical-old-world-clade-corvoid-passerines"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6803403,"mean":6.1842532809271,"rank":1584626,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4505219,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6803403,"percentile":66},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230111,"mean":7.940359280344,"rank":63554,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":163288,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230111,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2138,"mean":4.4186607393542,"rank":650,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":783,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2138,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":3.9492432432432,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
