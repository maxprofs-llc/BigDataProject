Local alignments are frequently constructed with the aid of a \"substitution score matrix\" that specifies a score for aligning each pair of amino acid residues. Over the years, many different substitution matrices have been proposed, based on a wide variety of rationales. Statistical results, however, demonstrate that any such matrix is implicitly a \"log-odds\" matrix, with a specific target distribution for aligned pairs of amino acid residues. In the light of information theory, it is possible to express the scores of a substitution matrix in bits and to see that different matrices are better adapted to different purposes. The most widely used matrix for protein sequence comparison has been the PAM-250 matrix. It is argued that for database searches the PAM-120 matrix generally is more appropriate, while for comparing two specific proteins with suspected homology the PAM-200 matrix is indicated. Examples discussed include the lipocalins, human alpha 1 B-glycoprotein, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and the globins.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e5c","authors":["S F Altschul"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-02T10:57:29+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0022-2836"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1254432124,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2051488"],"pmid":"2051488","pubdate":"1991-06-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Amino acid substitution matrices from an information theoretic perspective.","type":"article","volume":"219","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/amino-acid-substitution-matrices-information-theoretic-perspective-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627536,"mean":4.9480380313392,"rank":817603,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2286699,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627536,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93772,"mean":8.0685425344724,"rank":24384,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93772,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3301,"mean":2.5316339393939,"rank":252,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":1202,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3301,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":1.3964285714286,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
