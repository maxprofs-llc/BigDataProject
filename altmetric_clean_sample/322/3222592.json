This report describes a fatal case caused by an illegal fishing practice involving stunning fish with electric shocks produced by an electric generator carried through the water inside the carcass of an old refrigerator to keep it afloat. This occurrence is unusual because of the circumstances giving rise to the use of electric current and the cause of death, which resulted from the combination of the electric current produced by the generator and the saltwater, bringing about death by drowning.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f610006975","authors":["Nunzio Di Nunno","Luigi Vimercati","Luigi Viola","Francesco Vimercati"],"doi":"10.1097\/01.paf.0000070001.59275.08","first_seen_on":"2015-02-01T04:10:58+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0195-7910"],"issue":"2","journal":"The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1422763837,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12773854"],"pmid":"12773854","pubdate":"2003-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology","jurisprudence"],"title":"A case of electrocution during illegal fishing activities.","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/case-electrocution-during-illegal-fishing-activities"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4698042,"mean":5.7124864691489,"rank":2499570,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1558713,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4698042,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164337,"mean":8.8101596120148,"rank":86630,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":57433,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164337,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":458,"mean":2.6718205689278,"rank":232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":458,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.1,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
