The observed stage-dependent expression changes can be explained by genetic and epigenetic alterations as well as transcription dysregulation. Unlike genetic and epigenetic alterations, however, activity changes of transcription factors, generally occurring at the post-transcriptional or post-translational level, are hard to detect and quantify.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000823","authors":["Qi Liu","Pei-Fang Su","Shilin Zhao","Yu Shyr"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13073-014-0117-z","first_seen_on":"2015-02-01T00:32:41+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1756-994X",""],"issue":"12","journal":"Genome Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1423202692,"links":["http:\/\/genomemedicine.com\/content\/6\/12\/117","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25648588?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25648588"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/genomemedicine.com\/content\/pdf\/s13073-014-0117-z.pdf","pmcid":"PMC4293006","pmid":"25648588","pubdate":"2014-12-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Bioinformatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Genetics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Proteomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"117","title":"Transcriptome-wide signatures of tumor stage in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma: connecting copy number variation, methylation and transcription factor activity.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transcriptomewide-signatures-tumor-stage-kidney-renal-clear-cell-carcinoma-connecting-copy-number-va"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4723481,"mean":5.6986316415034,"rank":559923,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":4160585,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4723481,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":165359,"mean":8.7544329999157,"rank":26430,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":138810,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":165359,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":506,"mean":12.863227722772,"rank":215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":290,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":506,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":9.9007428571429,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
