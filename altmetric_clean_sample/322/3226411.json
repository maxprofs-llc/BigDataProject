The relative importance of the purity of the reactants, the ratio of oleic acid and sodium oleate, the maximum temperature, and the rate of temperature increase, on robust and reproducible size and shape-selective iron oxide nanoparticle synthesis are identified and discussed. The synthesis conditions that generate highly monodisperse iron oxide nanocubes suitable for producing large ordered arrays, or mesocrystals are described in detail.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100034e1","authors":["Erik Wetterskog","Michael Agthe","Arnaud Mayence","Jekabs Grins","Dong Wang","Subhasis Rana","Anwar Ahniyaz","German Salazar-Alvarez","Lennart Bergstr\u00f6m"],"doi":"10.1088\/1468-6996\/15\/5\/055010","first_seen_on":"2015-02-02T10:21:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1468-6996","1878-5514"],"issue":"5","journal":"Science & Technology of Advanced Materials","last_mentioned_on":1490688232,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1088\/1468-6996\/15\/5\/055010","http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/1468-6996\/15\/5\/055010\/article","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5099683"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/article\/10.1088\/1468-6996\/15\/5\/055010\/pdf","pmid":"27877722","pubdate":"2014-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"IOP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Materials Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"startpage":"055010","title":"Precise control over shape and size of iron oxide nanocrystals suitable for assembly into ordered particle arrays","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1088\/1468-6996\/15\/5\/055010","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/precise-control-shape-size-iron-oxide-nanocrystals-suitable-assembly-ordered-particle-arrays"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8425604,"mean":7.0878923279354,"rank":2082176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":6303142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8425604,"percentile":74},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242076,"mean":8.3202372487865,"rank":66739,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":173995,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242076,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":225,"mean":14.532160714286,"rank":71,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":152,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":225,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":7.8875,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Ph.
