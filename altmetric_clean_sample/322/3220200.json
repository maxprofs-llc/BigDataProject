High androgen levels, in turn, were supposed to be favored because they led to adaptive aggressive behavior. Incidental androgenization is no longer a tenable hypothesis, however, because genital masculinization has been shown to proceed in the absence of androgenic steroids. Thus, an alternative hypothesis is required. The genitals of spotted hyena females are not simply masculinized, but exhibit a detailed physical resemblance to the male genitalia. In the absence of satisfactory alternative explanations, we propose that selection may have favored sexual mimicry in females because they are more likely than males to be targets of aggression from other females. Male-like camouflage could theoretically be protective in three contexts: neonate sibling aggression, infanticide by conspecific females, and interclan territoriality. Current data suggest that if sexual mimicry is important, its effects are strongest among infants.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003413","authors":["Martin N Muller","Richard Wrangham"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T23:13:40+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0033-5770"],"issue":"1","journal":"Quarterly Review of Biology","last_mentioned_on":1304278696,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11963460"],"pmid":"11963460","pubdate":"2002-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Sexual mimicry in hyenas.","type":"article","volume":"77","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sexual-mimicry-hyenas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629179,"mean":4.9362043867828,"rank":816592,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2289773,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629179,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94914,"mean":8.0898302445399,"rank":24717,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69103,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94914,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261,"mean":6.5055769230769,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":13.918666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":2,"Associate Professor":5,"Assistant Professor":3,"Post Doc":5,"Ph.D. Student":22,"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)":5,"Researcher (at a non-Academic Institution)":8,"Other Professional":7,"Student (Postgraduate)":1,"Student (Master)":9,"Student (Bachelor)":4,"Lecturer":1,"Doctoral Student":2},"by_discipline":{"Biological Sciences":60,"Earth Sciences":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":1,"Environmental Sciences":11}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"AE":1,"US":1,"BR":4,"PE":1,"ZA":1,"GB":2,"JP":2,"IN":2}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Mimicry","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=426938369#altmetric_citation_25","license":"public","citation_ids":[3220198,3220200],"posted_on":"2011-05-01T19:38:16+00:00","summary":"In evolutionary biology, mimicry is a similarity of one species to another which protects one or both.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=247151","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Citation bot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Citation bot"}}]}}
