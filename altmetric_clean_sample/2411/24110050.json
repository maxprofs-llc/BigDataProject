Similar to left heart failure, sympathetic overactivation and \u03b2-adrenoreceptor (\u03b2AR) abnormalities are found in PAH. Based on successful therapy of left heart failure with \u03b2-blockade, the safety and benefits of the nonselective \u03b2-blocker\/vasodilator carvedilol were evaluated in PAH.\nPAH Treatment with Carvedilol for Heart Failure (PAHTCH) is a single-center, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. Following 1-week run-in, 30 participants were randomized to 1 of 3 arms for 24 weeks: placebo, low-fixed-dose, or dose-escalating carvedilol. Outcomes included clinical measures and mechanistic biomarkers.\nDecreases in heart rate and blood pressure with carvedilol were well tolerated; heart rate correlated with carvedilol dose. Carvedilol-treated groups had no decrease in exercise capacity measured by 6-minute walk, but had lower heart rates at peak and after exercise, and faster heart rate recovery. Dose-escalating carvedilol was associated with reduction in right ventricular (RV) glycolytic rate and increase in \u03b2AR levels. There was no evidence of RV functional deterioration; rather, cardiac output was maintained.\nCarvedilol is likely safe in PAH over 6 months of therapy and has clinical and mechanistic benefits associated with improved outcomes. The data provide support for longer and larger studies to establish guidelines for use of \u03b2-blockers in PAH.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT01586156FUNDING.
