Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), an effector of the small GTPase Rho, involved in cytoskeleton dynamic regulation and cell polarity is activated by hyperglycemia. In one year-old Goto Kakizaki (GK) type 2 diabetic rats retina, ROCK-1 activation was assessed by its cellular distribution and by phosphorylation of its substrates, MYPT1 and MLC. In both GK rat and in human type 2 diabetic retinas, ROCK-1 is activated and associated with non-apoptotic membrane blebbing in retinal vessels and in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) that respectively form the inner and the outer barriers. Activation of ROCK-1 induces focal vascular constrictions, endoluminal blebbing and subsequent retinal hypoxia. In RPE cells, actin cytoskeleton remodeling and membrane blebs in RPE cells contributes to outer barrier breakdown. Intraocular injection of fasudil, significantly reduces both retinal hypoxia and RPE barrier breakdown. Diabetes-induced cell blebbing may contribute to ischemic maculopathy and represent an intervention target.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Pierre-Rapha\u00ebl Rothschild","Sawsen Salah","Marianne Berdugo","Emmanuelle G\u00e9liz\u00e9","Kimberley Delaunay","Marie-Christine Naud","Christophe Klein","Alexandre Moulin","Mich\u00e8le Savoldelli","Ciara Bergin","Jean-Claude Jeanny","Laurent Jonet","Yvan Arsenijevic","Francine Behar-Cohen","Patricia Crisanti"],"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-017-07329-y","first_seen_on":"2017-08-20T16:07:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2045-2322"],"issue":"1","journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1503555845,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28821742?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28821742?dopt=Abstractu0026utm_source=dlvr.itu0026utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28821742","pubdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["science"],"title":"ROCK-1 mediates diabetes-induced retinal pigment epithelial and endothelial cell blebbing: Contribution to diabetic retinopathy","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rock1-mediates-diabetesinduced-retinal-pigment-epithelial-endothelial-cell-blebbing-contribution-dia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8422812,"mean":7.0866213065837,"rank":6391260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1144415,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8422812,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177678,"mean":12.757561440141,"rank":126229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":31972,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177678,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37619,"mean":14.728024190547,"rank":27065,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":6370,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37619,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3840,"mean":13.614466788226,"rank":2678,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":798,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3840,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
