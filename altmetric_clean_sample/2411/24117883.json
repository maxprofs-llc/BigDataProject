Given the pressing need for novel therapies for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), we sought to determine the antitumor effects of selinexor in vitro and in vivo.\nTwenty-six breast cancer cell lines of different breast cancer subtypes were treated with selinexor in vitro. Cell proliferation assays were used to measure the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) and to test the effects in combination with chemotherapy. In vivo efficacy was tested both as a single agent and in combination therapy in TNBC patient-derived xenografts (PDXs).\nSelinexor demonstrated growth inhibition in all 14 TNBC cell lines tested; TNBC cell lines were more sensitive to selinexor (median IC50 44 nM, range 11 to 550 nM) than were estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cell lines (median IC50\u2009>\u20091000 nM, range 40 to >1000 nM; P\u2009=\u20090.017). In multiple TNBC cell lines, selinexor was synergistic with paclitaxel, carboplatin, eribulin, and doxorubicin in vitro. Selinexor as a single agent reduced tumor growth in vivo in four of five different TNBC PDX models, with a median tumor growth inhibition ratio (T\/C: treatment\/control) of 42% (range 31 to 73%) and demonstrated greater antitumor efficacy in combination with paclitaxel or eribulin (average T\/C ratios of 27% and 12%, respectively).\nCollectively, these findings strongly suggest that selinexor is a promising therapeutic agent for TNBC as a single agent and in combination with standard chemotherapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007eb","authors":["Natalia Paez Arango","Erkan Yuca","Ming Zhao","Kurt W.
