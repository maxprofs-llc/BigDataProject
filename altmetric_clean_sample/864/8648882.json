Briefly, RGD peptides (RGD-1: SESDNNSSSRGDASYNSDES; RGD-2: ANSESDNNSSSRGDA; RGD-3: SRGDASYNSDESKD) were immobilized onto tissue culture polystyrene dishes (TCPS) assisted by carbodiimide chemistry. Surface characterization including carboxyl group quantification and amino acid analysis was carried out to ensure the existence of peptides on plates. Cells were inoculated to those peptides-modified and control dishes. Next, cell morphology was observed under phase contrast microscopy; cell number was counted manually by a hemocytometer. Furthermore, differentiation was examined by alkaline phosphatase activity quantification, conventional and real time RT-PCR. Finally, calcific deposition was observed by alizarin red staining and quantified using the cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) extraction method. Differences between the experimental groups and the control group were analyzed statistically using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's multiple comparison tests.\nPeptides were immobilized onto TCPS successfully as evidenced by carboxyl group density and amino acid analysis. Cell morphology remained unchanged between peptides-immobilized groups and control, but adhered cell numbers were higher on those peptides-immobilized dishes (significant differences existed between RGD-1-0.5 with control, RGD-2-0.1 with control, and RGD-3-0.5 with control, respectively). RGD-3-0.5 exhibited the highest alkaline phosphatase activity on day 7 (p<0.05), and promoted a two-fold greater DMP-1 mRNA expression compared to the control on day 10 (p<0.05). RGD peptides grafted dishes accelerated the mineralization of cells, among the experimental groups tested, RGD-3 groups (comprising RGD-3-0.1 and RGD-3-0.5) had significantly higher amounts of calcific deposition as compared to the control (p<0.05).\nRGD peptides originated from DPP especially RGD-3 promoted MDPC-23 differentiation and mineralization.
