The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has emerged as a\u00a0predictor of cardiovascular events and of long-term prognosis, especially in ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients undergoing primary PCI. The aim of our study was to evaluate the role of NLR on periprocedural myocardial infarction (MI) in patients undergoing non-urgent PCI.\nIn a\u00a0consecutive cohort of 1542 patients undergoing PCI, myonecrosis biomarkers were determined at\u00a06, 12, 24 and 48\u00a0hours post-procedure. Patients were divided into quintiles according to NLR values. Periprocedural myonecrosis was defined as a\u00a0troponin\u00a0I increase of 3\u00a0times the upper limit of normal or as 50\u2009% of an elevated baseline value, whereas periprocedural MI was defined as a\u00a0CK-MB increase of 3\u00a0times the upper limit of normal or 50\u2009% of baseline.\nHigher NLR was related to age, established risk factors and cardiovascular history. NLR was associated with severe coronary artery disease (p\u00a0= 0.009), tighter stenosis (p <\u00a00.001), coronary calcifications (p\u00a0= 0.005), intracoronary thrombus or thrombectomy use (p <\u00a00.001), TIMI flow pre- and post-PCI (p <\u00a00.001), and inversely to restenosis (p\u00a0= 0.04) and use of a\u00a0drug-eluting stent (p\u00a0= 0.001). NLR did not influence the occurrence of myonecrosis (p\u00a0= 0.75; adjusted OR (95\u2009%\u00a0CI)\u00a0= 0.99 (0.63-1.54), p\u00a0= 0.96), but was associated with a\u00a0higher occurrence of periprocedural MI, even after correction for baseline differences (p\u00a0= 0.03; adjusted OR (95\u2009%\u00a0CI)\u00a0= 1.33 (1.02-2.3), p\u00a0= 0.02), with NLR \u2265\u00a03 best predicting the risk of periprocedural MI at the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.\nIn patients undergoing non-urgent PCI, a\u00a0higher NLR increases the risk of periprocedural MI, especially for values \u2265\u00a03.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f61000827c","authors":["Verdoia, M","Schaffer, A","Barbieri, L","Di Giovine, G","Bellomo, G","Marino, P","Suryapranata, H","De Luca, G"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12471-016-0850-6","first_seen_on":"2016-06-10T13:11:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1568-5888","1876-6250"],"issue":"7-8","journal":"Netherlands Heart Journal","last_mentioned_on":1465558399,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27277659?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4943889","pmid":"27277659","pubdate":"2016-06-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Education","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Impact of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio on periprocedural myocardial infarction in patients undergoing non-urgent percutaneous coronary revascularisation","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-neutrophiltolymphocyte-ratio-periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-patients-undergoing-nonurge"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7879571,"mean":6.6725285125901,"rank":6823254,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7879571,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268520,"mean":11.398738405848,"rank":223780,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268520,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":209,"mean":4.2055865384615,"rank":176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":209,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":11.061111111111,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/troponinpapers\/statuses\/741231767365910529","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8643407],"posted_on":"2016-06-10T11:33:19+00:00","author":{"name":"Troponin_papers","url":"http:\/\/www.highsteacs.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/658230994202468352\/J1L9QKml_normal.png","description":"Twitter-bot from @highSTEACS searches PubMed for latest #troponin #research","id_on_source":"troponinpapers","tweeter_id":"4038106461","geo":{"lt":55.95206,"ln":-3.19648,"country":"GB"},"followers":265},"tweet_id":"741231767365910529"}]}}
