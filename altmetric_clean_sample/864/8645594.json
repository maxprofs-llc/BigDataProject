Current guidelines recommend continued HCC surveillance after sustained virologic response (SVR) has been achieved. This study aimed to investigate risk factors and incidence rates for HCC after SVR in HCV patients with pre-treatment advanced liver disease (METAVIR F3 and F4).\n\u2003All patients with advanced liver disease successfully treated for HCV at Karolinska University Hospital 1992-2013 (n=399), were followed-up for a median of 7.8 years. Data from National Registries were used to minimize loss to follow-up. Incidence rates and hazard ratios for development of HCC were calculated by Cox regression analysis.\n\u200317 patients developed HCC during 3366 person-years follow-up. The HCC incidence rate was 0.95 (95 % CI 0.57-1.6) and 0.15 (95 % CI 0.05-0.49) per 100 person years for patients with pre-treatment F4 and F3, respectively. Patients with pre-treatment cirrhosis and diabetes had a hazard ratio to develop HCC of 6.3, and an incidence rate of 7.9\/100 person-years (95 % CI 3.3-19) during the first two years of follow-up. The risk for HCC decreased significantly two years after SVR had been achieved.\n\u2003Diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis are strong risk factors for HCC development after SVR has been achieved. The risk to develop HCC diminishes significantly two years after SVR. Patients without cirrhosis have a low risk to develop HCC after SVR and the benefit of HCC surveillance for this group is questionable.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000255e","authors":["Magnus Hedenstierna","Ali Nangarhari","Ola Weiland","Soo Aleman"],"doi":"10.1093\/cid\/ciw362","endpage":"729","first_seen_on":"2016-06-10T15:50:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1058-4838","1537-6591"],"issue":"6","journal":"Clinical Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1473092154,"links":["http:\/\/cid.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/06\/08\/cid.ciw362.long","http:\/\/cid.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/06\/08\/cid.ciw362.abstract?platform=hootsuite","http:\/\/m.cid.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/63\/6\/723"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/cid.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/63\/6\/723.full.pdf","pmid":"27282709","pubdate":"2016-06-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"ciw362","subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Diabetes and cirrhosis are risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma after successful treatment of chronic hepatitis C.","type":"article","volume":"63","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diabetes-cirrhosis-risk-factors-hepatocellular-carcinoma-after-successful-treatment-chronic-hepatiti"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8331095,"mean":7.02255168024,"rank":1978765,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6314633,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8331095,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272173,"mean":11.574705061505,"rank":80842,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":190368,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272173,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8172,"mean":9.1446290539714,"rank":3090,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":5014,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8172,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159,"mean":19.354088607595,"rank":101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":58,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
