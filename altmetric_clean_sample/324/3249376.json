The regulation of mammary epithelial cell (MEC) apoptosis in bovine mammary gland occurs at three levels. The first level comprises intracellular regulatory proteins, e.g. Bcl-2 family death promoters and inhibitors. The second level is represented by intramammary inductors of apoptosis, e.g. FIL, IGFBPs, Fas ligand, TGF-betas. The expression and activity of these auto\/paracrine inductors of apoptosis is controlled and modulated by the third level factors, e.g. systemic galactopoetic hormones, nutrition, reproductive status and milking management. Our recent study proved that apoptosis in involuting bovine mammary gland is accompanied by increased intensity of autophagy, regarded as a cytoprotective process but in advanced stage as a PCD type II. Moreover, we have reported for the first time the ability of TGF-beta(1) to induce both apoptosis and autophagy in bovine BME-UV1 MEC. Much more pronounced heterogeneity of PCD was observed when breast cancer cells were exposed to anticancer drugs. The primary responses of breast cancer MCF-7 cells to camptothecin (CPT) are apoptosis and autophagy (as a cytoprotective process). In this case autophagy occurs in cells which are resistant to apoptosis as a tool of cancer cell survival. The fail-safe responses of breast cancer cells to persisting CPT-induced stress are apoptosis accompanied by morphological and biochemical features of autophagy or type II PCD with advanced subcellular degradation. The threshold between autophagy as a cytoprotective process (reversible) or PCD (irreversible) is difficult to establish and probably depends on the extent of degradation of cellular components. Proapoptotic protein Bid may serve as a molecular switch between apoptosis and autophagy. Bid knock down in MCF-7 cells exposed to CPT leads to a shift of cell death from apoptosis to autophagy. Since bid and other proapoptotic genes undergo mutations in malignant cells, the ability of cancer cells commitment to autophagy may have important therapeutic implications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007df4","authors":["Motyl T","Gajkowska B","Zarzy\u0144ska J","Gajewska M","Lamparska-Przybysz M"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T02:27:22+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1365165082,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17228094"],"pmid":"17228094","pubdate":"2007-01-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology","pharmacology"],"title":"Apoptosis and autophagy in mammary gland remodeling and breast cancer chemotherapy.","type":"article","volume":"57 Suppl 7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/apoptosis-autophagy-mammary-gland-remodelling-breast-cancer-chemotherapy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4095521,"mean":5.0915018305422,"rank":949883,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2578702,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4095521,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128786,"mean":9.0382541289749,"rank":39362,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":87619,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128786,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":182,"mean":1.9181546961326,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":130,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":182,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.1375,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
