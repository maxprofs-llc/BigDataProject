This paper reports the characteristics, pattern of misoprostol use and opinions of a group of 102 women (median age 25 years, range 16-49 years), from Fortaleza, capital of Cear\u00e1 state, who had used misoprostol to attempt abortion. Seventy-five percent were women of lower social class, 58% had less than 8 years of education and 46% were never married. Misoprostol was used for the first induced abortion by 65 women. Modal dose was 4 tablets--200 micrograms of misoprostol each--most frequently 2 tablets by oral route and 2 tablets by intravaginal route. This pattern of use was associated with the highest rate of abortion, mainly at 9-12 weeks of amenorrhea. Fifty-five percent of women had no pregnancy test; 41% had 8 weeks or less of amenorrhea. Curettage was performed in 49 of 84 women who reported abortion and in 41 of 43 women who entered the hospital. Infection and uterine perforation were the complications described. Seventy-two percent of women were in favor of legalization of abortion, but 52% were also in favor of the prohibition of misoprostol sales; 66% would not repeat misoprostol use and 53% would not suggest it to a friend. The poorest women were less favorable to misoprostol ban. Despite the current lack of safer alternatives, misoprostol does not seem a satisfactory solution to illegal abortion in Brazil.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f61000376a","authors":["H L Co\u00ealho","A C Teixeira","M de F Cruz","S L Gonzaga","P S Arrais","L Luchini","C La Vecchia","G Tognoni"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T01:55:32+00:00","issns":["0010-7824"],"issue":"2","journal":"Contraception","last_mentioned_on":1209818689,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8143449"],"pmid":"8143449","pubdate":"1994-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Misoprostol: the experience of women in Fortaleza, Brazil.","type":"article","volume":"49","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/misoprostol-experience-women-fortaleza-brazil"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3615908,"mean":4.932414788326,"rank":815318,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2276911,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3615908,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92263,"mean":7.08909468687,"rank":23376,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":67802,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92263,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":875,"mean":4.6815560640732,"rank":206,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":875,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.01,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Arts and Humanities":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":2,"BR":2}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Misoprostol","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=209893792#altmetric_citation_3","license":"public","citation_ids":[3247514,3247517],"posted_on":"2008-05-03T12:44:49+00:00","summary":"Misoprostol is a synthetic prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) analog used to prevent gastric ulcers, treat missed miscarriage, induce labor, and induce abortion.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=541197","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"DOI bot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:DOI bot"}}]}}
