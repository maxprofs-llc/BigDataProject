Methods: We reviewed records of 106 consecutive patients with MCC of the head and neck treated with radiation (RT) at our institution between 1988 and 2011. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate outcomes and hazard ratios were calculated. Results: The 5-year actuarial local and regional control rates were 96% and 96%. There were no regional recurrences in 22 patients treated with RT to gross nodal disease without neck dissection. The 5-year cause specific survival rate was 76%. Lymphadenopathy at presentation impacted distant metastatic free survival outcomes (P<0.001). Treatment was well tolerated with only five patients having\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 toxicities. Conclusion: For MCC of the head and neck, a management strategy that includes radiotherapy offers excellent locoregional control. Gross nodal disease can be successfully treated with radiation therapy. This article is protected by copyright.
