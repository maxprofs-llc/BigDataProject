RNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and analyzed using nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction with primers to detect BDV p24 and p40.\nBDV transcripts were not detected in samples from any of the 62 schizophrenic patients. These data do not support an etiologic association between BDV infection and the deficit form of schizophrenia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f61000215a","authors":["Kim, Yong-Ku","Kim, Sang-Hyun","Han, Chang-Su","Lee, Heon-Jeong","Kim, Hyung-Seob","Yoon, Sung-Chul","Kim, Dai-Jin","Song, Ki-Joon","Maes, Michael","Song, Jin-Won","Kim, Yong\u2010Ku","Kim, Sang\u2010Hyun","Han, Chang\u2010Su","Lee, Heon\u2010Jeong","Kim, Hyung\u2010Seob","Yoon, Sung\u2010Chul","Kim, Dai\u2010Jin","Song, Ki\u2010Joon","Song, Jin\u2010Won"],"doi":"10.1034\/j.1601-5215.2003.00043.x","endpage":"265","first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T01:52:31+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1601-5215","0924-2708"],"issue":"5","journal":"Acta Neuropsychiatrica","last_mentioned_on":1232497121,"links":["http:\/\/www3.interscience.wiley.com\/journal\/118844334\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1034\/j.1601-5215.2003.00043.x\/pdf","pmid":"26983654","pubdate":"2016-03-19T22:02:12+00:00","publisher":"Munksgaard International Publishers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"262","title":"Borna disease virus and deficit schizophrenia","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/borna-disease-virus-deficit-schizophrenia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6418668,"mean":5.9879820074789,"rank":1460657,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":4327572,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6418668,"percentile":67},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":204608,"mean":8.4361165258277,"rank":59776,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":141900,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":204608,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":292,"mean":1.9187972508591,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":249,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":292,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":3.4849,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Other":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Neuroscience":1,"Unspecified":2}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Borna disease","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=265389092#altmetric_citation_8","license":"public","citation_ids":[3247344],"posted_on":"2009-01-21T00:18:41+00:00","summary":"Borna disease is an infectious neurological syndrome of warm-blooded animals, caused by Borna disease virus (BDV), which causes abnormal behaviour and fatality.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=608853","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Arcadian","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Arcadian"}}]}}
