Receptors of the cholecystokinin family have been shown to be overexpressed in different types of neuroendocrine tumors. The purposes of this study were to evaluate the cholecystokinin octapeptide amide (CCK8) peptide tagged with a diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid derivative (DTPAGlu) and to test whether a (111)In-labeled conjugate ((111)In-DTPAGlu-G-CCK8, a derivative containing the chelating agent DTPAGlu bound through a glycine linker at the N-terminal end of the bioactive peptide CCK8) is suitable for cholecystokinin-B receptor (CCKBR) imaging.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007da6","authors":["Aloj L","Carac\u00f2 C","Panico M","Zannetti A","Del Vecchio S","Tesauro D","De Luca S","Arra C","Pedone C","Morelli G","Salvatore M"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T02:12:54+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Journal of Nuclear Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1248107085,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15001692"],"pmid":"15001692","pubdate":"2004-01-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"In vitro and in vivo evaluation of 111In-DTPAGlu-G-CCK8 for cholecystokinin-B receptor imaging.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vitro-vivo-evaluation-111indtpaglugcck8-cholecystokininb-receptor-imaging"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3926119,"mean":5.0184091481892,"rank":898779,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2488757,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3926119,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121101,"mean":8.9901579064718,"rank":36173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":83317,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121101,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1358,"mean":2.4266514369934,"rank":149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":1106,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1358,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":4.0762295081967,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
