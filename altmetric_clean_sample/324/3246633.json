In transfected baby hamster kidney cells, Rat1 fibroblasts, and normal IM9 lymphoblasts, PTP1D directly binds activated insulin receptor. This interaction is mediated by catalytic domain-proximal SH2 determinants of the phosphatase and phosphotyrosine 1146 of the activated insulin receptor. While the receptor and the phosphatase do not serve as substrates for each other, their interaction promotes IRS-1 binding to the receptor, indicating that PTP1D functions as an adapter for insulin receptor and IRS-1. The formation of a multiprotein signaling complex involving the insulin receptor, PTP1D, and IRS-1 enhances cellular glucose uptake, a critical process in the physiological action of insulin.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Alexei Kharitonenkov","J\u00fcrgen Schnekenburger","Zhengjun Chen","Pjotr Knyazev","Suhad Ali","Esther Zwick","Morris White","Axel Ullrich"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.270.49.29189","first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T01:41:14+00:00","issns":["1083-351X","0021-9258"],"journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1248109400,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1074\/jbc.270.49.29189","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7493946"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/270\/49\/29189.full.pdf","pmid":"7493946","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Adapter function of protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1D in insulin receptor\/insulin receptor substrate-1 interaction.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adapter-function-proteintyrosine-phosphatase-1d-insulin-receptorinsulin-receptor-substrate1-interact"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3926119,"mean":5.0184091481892,"rank":898778,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2489445,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3926119,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121034,"mean":8.9894561770273,"rank":36173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":83357,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121034,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28861,"mean":2.5136015947305,"rank":1886,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":11819,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28861,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":318,"mean":3.5696025236593,"rank":61,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":257,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":318,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
