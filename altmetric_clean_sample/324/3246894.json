Apart from the clinical seriousness, heart failure is always characterized by an energy depletion status, as indicated by low intramyocardial ATP and coenzyme Q10 levels. We investigated safety and clinical efficacy of Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) adjunctive treatment in congestive heart failure which had been diagnosed at least 6 months previously and treated with standard therapy. A total of 2664 patients in NYHA classes II and III were enrolled in this open noncomparative 3-month postmarketing study in 173 Italian centers. The daily dosage of CoQ10 was 50-150 mg orally, with the majority of patients (78%) receiving 100 mg\/day. Clinical and laboratory parameters were evaluated at the entry into the study and on day 90; the assessment of clinical signs and symptoms was made using from two-to seven-point scales. The results show a low incidence of side effects: 38 adverse effects were reported in 36 patients (1.5%) of which 22 events were considered as correlated to the test treatment. After three months of test treatment the proportions of patients with improvement in clinical signs and symptoms were as follows: cyanosis 78.1%, oedema 78.6%, pulmonary rales 77.8%, enlargement of liver area 49.3%, jugular reflux 71.81%, dyspnoea 52.7%, palpitations 75.4%, sweating 79.8%, subjective arrhytmia 63.4%, insomnia 662.8%, vertigo 73.1% and nocturia 53.6%. Moreover we observed a contemporary improvement of at least three symptoms in 54% of patients; this could be interpreted as an index of improved quality of life.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f610003110","authors":["E Baggio","R Gandini","A C Plancher","M Passeri","G Carmosino"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T01:45:22+00:00","issns":["0098-2997"],"journal":"Molecular Aspects of Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1223931793,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7752841"],"pmid":"7752841","pubdate":"1994-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Italian multicenter study on the safety and efficacy of coenzyme Q10 as adjunctive therapy in heart failure.
