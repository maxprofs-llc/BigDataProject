The method was applied to human EEGs taken during conditions of listening to complex rhythmic (Mozart symphony and chanting) and non-rhythmic (conversation) sounds. The method indicated a tendency towards single generation in the alpha (8-12 Hz) band during the rhythmic conditions. The method was then extended to test for synchrony between the EEG signals and the auditory signal (as a function of frequency). Such synchrony (auditory driving) was indicated during rhythmic conditions in the alpha band.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e7a","authors":["L J Rogers","D O Walter"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T01:47:32+00:00","issns":["0165-0270"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Neuroscience Methods","last_mentioned_on":1195443176,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7300432"],"pmid":"7300432","pubdate":"1981-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Methods for finding single generators, with application to auditory driving of the human EEG by complex stimuli.","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/methods-finding-single-generators-application-auditory-driving-human-eeg-complex-stimuli"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633425,"mean":4.921826751301,"rank":815878,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295404,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633425,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94836,"mean":8.1248321400329,"rank":24675,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69064,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94836,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":514,"mean":2.2049785575049,"rank":70,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":366,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":514,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":4.6443333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Ph.
