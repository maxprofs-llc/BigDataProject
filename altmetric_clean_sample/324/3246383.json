It was shown that poor tanners who ever used psoralen tanning activators display a four-fold increase in melanoma risk when compared to poor tanners using regular sunscreens. Although psoralens have now banned from suntan lotions, it is likely that the increase in melanoma risk linked to their previous use will persist for several years.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002280","authors":["P.
