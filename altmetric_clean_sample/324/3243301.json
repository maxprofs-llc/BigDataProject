Multiple functions are indicated for AMPK in the CNS. While all neurons sense their own energy status, some integrate neuro-humoral signals to assess organismal energy balance. A variety of disease states may involve AMPK, so determining the underlying mechanisms is important. We review the impact of altered AMPK activity under physiological (hunger, satiety) and pathophysiological (stroke) conditions, as well as therapeutic manipulations of AMPK that may improve energy balance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e72","authors":["Gabriele V.
