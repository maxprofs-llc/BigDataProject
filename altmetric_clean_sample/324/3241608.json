The polymerase was solubilized with detergent, and RNA was removed by precipitation with 2 M LiCl. The solubilized polymerase required both poly(A) and oligo(U) for activity and was stimulated by Mg2+ but was inhibited by Mn2+. Poly(A)-oligo(U)-dependent poly(U) polymerase was not found in extracts of HeLa cells until about 2 hr after poliovirus infection, and then there was a linear increase in activity until about 5 hr. Analysis of the polymerase by glycerol gradient centrifugation showed that the majority of the activity sedimented at about 4 S, indicating that it was no longer complexed with high-molecular-weight RNA or cellular membranes. This poly(A)-oligo(U)-dependent polymerase activity could represent an important component of the poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"1977PNAS...74.3677F","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["J B Flanegan","D Baltimore"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.74.9.3677","first_seen_on":"2015-02-02T21:40:19+00:00","issns":["1091-6490","0027-8424"],"issue":"9","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1392662915,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.74.9.3677","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/198796","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC431685","http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/74\/9\/3677.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/74\/9\/3677.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC431685","pmid":"198796","pubdate":"2015-06-09T03:49:36+00:00","publisher":"National Acad Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Poliovirus-specific primer-dependent RNA polymerase able to copy poly(A)","type":"article","volume":"74","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/poliovirusspecific-primerdependent-rna-polymerase-able-copy-polya"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6831189,"mean":6.1898257547562,"rank":1044723,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":5770996,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6831189,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230211,"mean":7.9465257981844,"rank":43187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":186857,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230211,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41713,"mean":21.645941839279,"rank":14779,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":26751,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41713,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":970,"mean":47.240705882353,"rank":504,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":464,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":970,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
