The powder X-ray diffraction pattern of this new phase was indexed with a hexagonal cell of a = 9.968(1) \u00c5 and c = 3.2933(4) \u00c5. Crystal structure refinement using synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction data led to RWP = 8.53% and RP = 5.55%, and the crystal structure was closely related with that of Ba2SrY6O12. No photocatalytic activity for phenol decomposition was observed under visible-light irradiation in spite of a good performance for its mother compound, NaBiO3. The optical band-gap energy of \u03b2-NaBiO3 was narrower than that of NaBiO3, which was confirmed with density of states curves simulated by first-principles density functional theory calculation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Octavianti Naa"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.6b00947","first_seen_on":"2016-05-31T18:40:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0020-1669","1520-510X"],"issue":"12","journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1464720010,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.6b00947"],"pmid":"27243818","pubdate":"2016-05-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"\n              High-Pressure Polymorph of NaBiO\n              3\n            ","type":"article","volume":"55","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highpressure-polymorph-nabio3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7836572,"mean":6.6415682037409,"rank":6787546,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7836572,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269297,"mean":11.365096392074,"rank":224329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269297,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8904,"mean":1.1243313489835,"rank":5030,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8904,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":365,"mean":1.079532967033,"rank":234,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":365,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
