Studies of adolescent suicide risk tend to focus on factors such as psychiatric diagnosis--particularly depression--and history of previous suicide attempts in predicting risk of future suicidal behavior. However, given that a large number of adolescent suicides are first-time attempts, understanding the circumstances that precede suicide attempts--including the nature of suicidal ideation and of the cognitive and emotional responses that precede ideation--is a critical part of preventing a potentially lethal attempt. We review the psychological precipitants that may inform how suicidal thoughts are transferred into action and examine the risk conferred by having a history of previous suicide attempts and ideation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51b3cf058f6100038d2","authors":["Miranda, Regina","Shaffer, David"],"doi":"10.1111\/nyas.12291","endpage":"21","first_seen_on":"2013-10-18T20:57:15+00:00","issns":["1749-6632","0077-8923"],"issue":"1","journal":"Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1382129825,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/nyas.12291\/abstract;jsessionid=29B3C13AE1E1274EE5E5865472B3B75A.f03t03"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/nyas.12291\/pdf","pmid":"24138124","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"14","subjects":["science"],"title":"Understanding the suicidal moment in adolescence","type":"article","volume":"1304","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/understanding-suicidal-moment-adolescence"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6294277,"mean":5.9778739232289,"rank":4652019,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":941247,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6294277,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113510,"mean":7.8615041274261,"rank":75622,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":20283,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113510,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2819,"mean":4.6731405251952,"rank":2311,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":299,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2819,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.7973684210526,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
