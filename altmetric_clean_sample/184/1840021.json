Whereas initial studies were limited to the ex vivo loading of dendritic cells (DCs) with antigen-encoding mRNA, recent progress has led to the development of improved mRNA vaccines that enable direct in vivo targeting of DCs. Although preclinical studies demonstrated their potency in inducing antitumor immunity, several bottlenecks hinder the broader application of mRNA vaccines. In this review, we discuss the challenges associated with mRNA-based vaccination strategies, the technological advances that have been made to overcome these limitations, and the hurdles that remain to be tackled for the development of an optimal mRNA vaccine.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036b0","authors":["Charlotte Pollard","Stefaan De Koker","Xavier Saelens","Guido Vanham","Johan Grooten","Pollard C","De Koker S","Saelens X","Vanham G","Grooten J"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.molmed.2013.09.002","endpage":"713","first_seen_on":"2013-10-18T17:45:51+00:00","handle":"1854\/LU-4252155","handles":["1854\/LU-4252155"],"issns":["1471-4914","14714914"],"issue":"12","journal":"Trends in Molecular Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1382155198,"links":["http:\/\/www.cell.com\/trends\/molecular-medicine\/abstract\/S1471-4914(13)00166-4","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.molmed.2013.09.002"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/download.cell.com\/trends\/molecular-medicine\/pdf\/PIIS1471491413001664.pdf","pmid":"24138818","pubdate":"2013-10-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"705","subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Challenges and advances towards the rational design of mRNA vaccines","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/challenges-advances-towards-rational-design-mrna-vaccines"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6230817,"mean":5.9681223701699,"rank":2550270,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3543616,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6230817,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112680,"mean":7.8914422918202,"rank":46684,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":62492,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112680,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":586,"mean":6.2186837606838,"rank":358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":201,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":586,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":4.2094285714286,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
