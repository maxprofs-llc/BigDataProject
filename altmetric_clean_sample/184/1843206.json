However replication studies in independent cohorts of same and different ethnicities are essential for establishing the credibility of a genotype-phenotype association. With this notion, in the present study we have performed a replication study of the reported association of SNPs in EGR2 in a case-control study comprising of 867 unrelated Japanese bipolar disorder patients and 895 age-, sex- and ethnicity-matched controls. Results showed no significant differences in allele and genotype frequencies of EGR2 SNPs between bipolar disorder patients and controls and also in a sex-stratified genetic analysis. The haplotype and meta-analyses also showed no significant association with bipolar disorder. In conclusion, this is the first replication study of the previously reported association of EGR2 with bipolar disorder in a larger sample set and the results showed that the EGR2 gene is unlikely to contribute to the susceptibility of bipolar disorder in a Japanese cohort.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002932","authors":["Shabeesh Balan","Kazuo Yamada","Yoshimi Iwayama","Tomoko Toyota","Tetsuo Ohnishi","Motoko Maekawa","Manabu Toyoshima","Yasuhide Iwata","Katsuaki Suzuki","Mitsuru Kikuchi","Hiroshi Ujike","Toshiya Inada","Hiroshi Kunugi","Norio Ozaki","Nakao Iwata","Shinichiro Nanko","Tadafumi Kato","Takeo Yoshikawa"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.gene.2013.05.055","first_seen_on":"2013-10-19T10:01:45+00:00","issns":["1879-0038"],"issue":"2","journal":"Gene","last_mentioned_on":1382176858,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23747400?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23747400","pubdate":"2013-09-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Lack of association of EGR2 variants with bipolar disorder in Japanese population.","type":"article","volume":"526","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lack-association-egr2-variants-bipolar-disorder-japanese-population"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632299,"mean":4.9243828402896,"rank":2898234,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":81244,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632299,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95038,"mean":7.6204130391324,"rank":75312,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":471,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95038,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3489,"mean":2.3447115825688,"rank":2741,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":238,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3489,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":1.5561470588235,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Neuroscience":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":3}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Bipolar_Blogs\/status\/391504235419803648","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1843206],"posted_on":"2013-10-19T10:00:58+00:00","author":{"name":"Bipolar Blogs","url":"http:\/\/www.pathsoflight.us\/bipolarwinds","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3605210516\/e9da8d6cabf3994c6ec4ab42483804b9_normal.png","description":"Blogs & news from the minds of people living with bipolar and researchers.
