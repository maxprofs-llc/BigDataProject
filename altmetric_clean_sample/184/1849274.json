We designed and investigated the spin-dependent electron transport of a device configuration, which is easy to be fabricated, with an oxygen-terminated ZGNR central scatter region between two hydrogen-terminated ZGNR electrodes. According to the analysis based on non-equilibrium Green's function and density functional theory, the proposed device could maintain its good spin-filter performance (80% to 99%) and have a stable magneto resistance value up to 10(5)%. The spin dependent electron transmission spectrum and space-resolve density of states are employed to investigate the physical origin of the spin-polarized current and magneto resistance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Qing-Qing Sun","Lu-Hao Wang","Wen Yang","Peng Zhou","Peng-Fei Wang","Shi-Jin Ding","David Wei Zhang"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep02921","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2013-10-22T18:47:21+00:00","issns":["xxxx-xxxx","2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1382458854,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/srep\/2013\/131011\/srep02921\/full\/srep02921.html?WT.ec_id=SREP-20131022"],"pmid":"24132194","pubdate":"2013-10-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Electronic properties and devices","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Electronic and spintronic devices","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"","subjects":["science"],"title":"Atomic Scale Investigation of a Graphene Nano-ribbon Based High Efficiency Spin Valve","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/atomic-scale-investigation-graphene-nanoribbon-based-high-efficiency-spin-valve"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3615588,"mean":4.9308346993203,"rank":2902596,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":70921,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3615588,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94988,"mean":7.7044123511639,"rank":75828,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":185,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94988,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6940,"mean":10.78355670846,"rank":5619,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6940,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":603,"mean":11.445893687708,"rank":469,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":603,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
