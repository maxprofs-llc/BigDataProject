Relaxin protein and mRNA were localized using antibodies developed to synthetic hamster relaxin and gene-specific molecular probes, respectively. Molecular weight and isoelectric point of the synthetic and native hormones were identical by electrophoretic methods, and synthetic hamster relaxin was active in the mouse interpubic ligament bioassay. Synthetic hormone was used as tracer and standard with rabbit antiserum to the synthetic hormone in the RIA. Relaxin was assayed in blood samples recovered from the retro-orbital plexus on Days 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, and 16 of gestation and on Days 1 and 5 postpartum. Relaxin was first detected on Day 8 of gestation (3.7 +\/- 0.6 ng\/ml), increased to reach a maximum in the evening of Day 15 (826.0 +\/- 124.0 ng\/ml), and decreased by Day 16 (day of parturition). Relaxin concentrations were assayed in aqueous extracts of implantation sites (Days 6, 8, and 10) and chorioallantoic placentae (Days 12, 14, and 15). Concentrations were low on Day 6 (0.02 +\/- 0.001 microg\/g tissue), increased to Day 15 (6.96 +\/- 0.86 microg\/g tissue), and subsequently declined by the evening of Day 15. Relaxin protein and mRNA were localized to primary and secondary giant trophoblast cells in the chorioallantoic placental trophospongium. However, relaxin protein was not localized in ovaries of pregnant animals or oviductal tissues of cycling animals. Significant quantities of relaxin were detected in the serum of fetal hamsters recovered on Day 15.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c6e","authors":["Randall H Renegar","Charles R Owens"],"first_seen_on":"2013-10-22T13:19:22+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0006-3363"],"issue":"2","journal":"Biology of Reproduction","last_mentioned_on":1382447949,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12135888?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"12135888","pubdate":"2002-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Measurement of plasma and tissue relaxin concentrations in the pregnant hamster and fetus using a homologous radioimmunoassay.","type":"article","volume":"67","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/measurement-plasma-tissue-relaxin-concentrations-pregnant-hamster-fetus-using-homologous-radioimmuno"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635015,"mean":4.9193540767705,"rank":2016699,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":947053,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635015,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95756,"mean":7.6081472299099,"rank":49774,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":25650,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95756,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1449,"mean":2.182770718232,"rank":734,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1449,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
