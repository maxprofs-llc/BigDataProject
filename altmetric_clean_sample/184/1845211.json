The amount of seismic strain release (or 'strain drop') is thus a direct measurement of a basic earthquake property, that is, the ratio of seismic slip over the dimension of the ruptured fault. Here the analysis of a new global catalogue, containing ~1,700 earthquakes with magnitude larger than 6, suggests that strain drop is independent of earthquake depth and magnitude. This invariance implies that deep earthquakes are even more similar to their shallow counterparts than previously thought, a puzzling finding as shallow and deep earthquakes are believed to originate from different physical mechanisms. More practically, this property contributes to our ability to predict the damaging waves generated by future earthquakes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Martin Vall\u00c3\u00a9e"],"doi":"10.1038\/ncomms3606","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2013-10-20T19:52:04+00:00","issns":["2041-1733"],"journal":"Nature Communications","last_mentioned_on":1382298524,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ncomms\/2013\/131015\/ncomms3606\/full\/ncomms3606.html"],"pmid":"24126256","pubdate":"2013-10-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"","title":"Source time function properties indicate a strain drop independent of earthquake depth and magnitude","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/source-time-function-properties-indicate-strain-drop-independent-earthquake-depth-magnitude"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627884,"mean":4.9451200333677,"rank":2904983,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75054,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627884,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94980,"mean":7.643775108182,"rank":75487,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":302,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94980,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5128,"mean":25.991219816657,"rank":4707,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5128,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":363,"mean":32.817524861878,"rank":327,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":363,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
