Both substituents and halide anions play a critical role in the formation and stabilization of cubic cages. Changing one of the factors in the reaction will switch the final structure to a Ni14L24 rhombic dodecahedral cage. The cubic cage can transform to a large rhombic dodecahedral cage in the presence of methylamine at room temperature accompanied by a color change from purple to light yellow.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Xiao-Ping Zhou","Yuan Wu","Dan Li"],"doi":"10.1021\/ja4092984","first_seen_on":"2013-10-19T00:20:33+00:00","issns":["0002-7863","1520-5126"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1412848872,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ja4092984","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24117433?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24117433","pubdate":"2013-10-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"131018141207006","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Polyhedral Metal-Imidazolate Cages: Control of Self-assembly and Cage to Cage Transformation.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/polyhedral-metalimidazolate-cages-control-selfassembly-cage-cage-transformation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4348929,"mean":4.8990146302829,"rank":3184992,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":940935,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4348929,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99591,"mean":7.3901967667437,"rank":73661,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":21176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99591,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15215,"mean":4.0136906796372,"rank":11950,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":2766,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15215,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":469,"mean":4.7185897435897,"rank":378,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":72,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":469,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
