We sought to determine whether electrical stimulation could enhance the differentiation and maturation of hESC-derived cardiomyocytes. Cardiac differentiation was induced in a HES3 hESC line via embryoid bodies formation treated with a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor. Detailed molecular and functional analysis were performed in those hESC-derived cardiomyocytes cultured for 4 days in the absence or presence of electrical field stimulation (6.6 V\/cm, 1 Hz, and 2 ms pulses) using an eight-channel C-Pace stimulator (Ion-Optics Co., MA). Upon electrical stimulation, quantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated significant upregulation of cardiac-specific gene expression including HCN1, MLC2V, SCN5A, SERCA, Kv4.3, and GATA4; immunostaining and flow cytometry analysis revealed cellular elongation and an increased proportion of troponin-T positive cells (6.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2% vs. 15.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1%; n\u2009=\u20093, P\u2009<\u20090.01). Electrophysiological studies showed an increase in the proportion of ventricular-like hESC-derived cardiomyocytes (48 vs. 29%, P\u2009<\u20090.05) with lengthening of their action potential duration at 90% repolarization (387.7\u2009\u00b1\u200935.35; n\u2009=\u200911 vs. 291.8\u2009\u00b1\u200920.82; n\u2009=\u200910, P\u2009<\u20090.05) and 50% repolarization (313.9\u2009\u00b1\u200927.94; n\u2009=\u200911 vs. 234.0\u2009\u00b1\u200916.10; n\u2009=\u200910, P\u2009<\u20090.05) after electrical stimulation. Nonetheless, the membrane diastolic potentials and action potential upstrokes of different hESC-derived cardiomyocyte phenotypes, and the overall beating rate remained unchanged (all P\u2009>\u20090.05). Fluorescence confocal imaging revealed that electrical stimulation significantly increased both spontaneous and caffeine-induced calcium flux in the hESC-derived cardiomyocytes (approximately 1.6-fold for both cases; P\u2009<\u20090.01). In conclusion, electrical field stimulation increased the expression of cardiac-specific genes and the yield of differentiation, promoted ventricular-like phenotypes, and improved the calcium handling of hESC-derived cardiomyocytes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bbc","authors":["Yau-Chi Chan","Sherwin Ting","Yee-Ki Lee","Kwong-Man Ng","Jiao Zhang","Zi Chen","Chung-Wah Siu","Steve K.
