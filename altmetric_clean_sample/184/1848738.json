We addressed the role of CCR1 and its ligands CCL3\/MIP-1\u03b1 and CCL5\/RANTES in dengue infection using three different approaches: an ex\u00a0vivo model exploring memory immune response in subjects with a well characterized dengue immune background, an in\u00a0vivo study in patients with primary or secondary dengue infection, and an approach in fatal dengue. CCR1 and CCL3\/MIP-1\u03b1 gene expression showed differences after homotypic and heterotypic challenge according to dengue immune background of subjects, in correspondence with previous observations in Cuban dengue outbreaks. CCL5\/RANTES gene expression was higher after homotypic challenge. CCR1 and CCL3\/MIP-1\u03b1 gene expression was higher in patients with secondary infection during critical days of the dengue disease, while the increase in RANTES expression started earlier than the observed for CCR1 and CCL3\/MIP-1\u03b1. CCR1 and CCL3\/MIP-1\u03b1 gene expression was as high in brain as in spleen tissue from necropsy. Our results confirm the strong influence of previous immunity in subsequent dengue infections, and confer a possible pathogenic role to CCR1 and CCL3\/MIP-1\u03b1 in dengue disease and a possible protective role for CCL5\/RANTES, probably through CCR5 interaction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5043cf058f6100030c1","authors":["Beatriz Sierra","Ana B.
