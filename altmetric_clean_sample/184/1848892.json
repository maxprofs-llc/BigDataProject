Vaccination is a proven strategy to reduce infections. However, vaccination rates among patients with inflammatory autoimmune conditions, including psoriasis, remain low. We review the literature regarding vaccine-preventable illness and vaccinations commonly used in the United States in patients older than 18 years on immunosuppressive therapies that are used in the treatment of psoriasis. The medical board of the National Psoriasis Foundation recommends that dermatologists counsel patients on updating vaccinations in accordance with recommendations of the Advisory Committee for\u00a0Immunization Practices as any measures taken to prevent infection can increase the safety of immunomodulatory therapies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e8d","authors":["Lara Wine-Lee","Sara C Keller","Marissa B Wilck","Stephen J Gluckman","Abby S Van Voorhees"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jaad.2013.06.046","first_seen_on":"2013-10-22T16:40:43+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1097-6787"],"journal":"Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1382432400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24075223"],"pmid":"24075223","pubdate":"2013-09-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"From the Medical Board of the National Psoriasis Foundation: Vaccination in adult patients on systemic therapy for psoriasis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/medical-board-national-psoriasis-foundation-vaccination-adult-patients-systemic-therapy-psoriasis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631090,"mean":4.9276517821564,"rank":439957,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":3173118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631090,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95629,"mean":7.6227869661608,"rank":14909,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":80073,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95629,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1828,"mean":2.6974373289546,"rank":125,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":1688,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1828,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":1.3521276595745,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
