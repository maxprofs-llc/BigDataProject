NMO is associated with the highly specific NMO-IgG biomarker, an antibody that binds the aquaporin-4 water channel. Aquaporin-4 is present on glial endfeet in the central nervous system (CNS). In humans, the NMO-IgG portends more frequent exacerbations and a worse long-term clinical outcome.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007cc","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2377-13-104","first_seen_on":"2013-10-18T21:07:16+00:00","issns":["1471-2377"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1375977715,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2377\/13\/104\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2377-13-104.pdf","pmid":"23927715","pubdate":"2013-08-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurochemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"104","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Passively transferred human NMO-IgG exacerbates demyelination in mouse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/passively-transferred-human-nmoigg-exacerbates-demyelination-mouse-experimental-autoimmune-encephalo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505617,"mean":5.1020565259269,"rank":3136912,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1019090,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505617,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101293,"mean":7.6890130118866,"rank":70911,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":21883,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101293,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":900,"mean":3.2236240266963,"rank":616,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":144,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":900,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71,"mean":3.0154285714286,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
