An increasing number of patients with IPF are receiving treatment with these novel therapies, and the risk of adverse events that may be associated with their use must be carefully evaluated.\nSafety data about nintedanib and pirfenidone is critically evaluated, including data from randomized clinical trials and post-marketing reports. Management strategies to minimize the occurrence of side effects are summarized.\nThe safety profile of the two anti-fibrotic drugs approved for clinical use in IPF patients appears to be comparable. Data from clinical trials and initial post-marketing surveillance indicate that most of the observed side effects are mild and easily manageable. However, approximately 1\/5 of patients may discontinue treatment as a consequence of side effects. Careful patient counselling, and regular follow-up during therapy could reduce the rate of discontinuations. Ongoing post-marketing surveillance may further inform our understanding of the safety profile of these therapies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073c3","authors":["Sophie Fletcher"],"doi":"10.1080\/14740338.2016.1218470","endpage":"7","first_seen_on":"2016-08-18T08:06:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1474-0338","1744-764X"],"issue":"11","journal":"Expert Opinion on Drug Safety","last_mentioned_on":1471989338,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/14740338.2016.1218470?ai=1pmh6&mi=ianpxd&af=R","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/14740338.2016.1218470?journalCode=ieds20"],"pmid":"27532218","pubdate":"2016-08-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"The safety of new drug treatments for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/safety-new-drug-treatments-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8266357,"mean":6.977935429341,"rank":4092267,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":4110540,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8266357,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254009,"mean":12.210685521715,"rank":125983,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":125622,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254009,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":752,"mean":2.3909400798935,"rank":267,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":480,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":752,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":1.1985714285714,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
