While previous studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety of the Impella device, more clinically relevant data are necessary, especially with regard to outcomes.\nWe screened our database of Impella patients in our heart center and found 68 consecutive patients who underwent Impella implantation due to acute coronary syndrome (ACS) complicated by cardiogenic shock. Data were evaluated with regard to baseline and procedural characteristics and also included an assessment of the short-term and long-term outcomes. The majority of patients (74%) suffered from an ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and 59% of patients received the Impella device during the initial coronary angiography. In the remaining cases, Impella implantation was performed at a later time, most commonly after IABP implantation. Patient characteristics were not significantly different between both groups. The predominantly implanted device was an Impella 2.5. Mortality in the severely ill patient population remained high, but univariate\/multivariate analyses identified significant risk factors. Interestingly, delayed initiation of Impella support was an independent predictor of higher long-term mortality (hazard ratio, 2.157; P=.04) within the Impella patient cohort.\nThis large series of patients with ACS complicated by cardiogenic shock who underwent Impella implantation provides information on the relevant risk factors for mortality. Early (compared with delayed) initiation of Impella support was a predictor of improved survival in this population of patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cfa","authors":["Schroeter, Marco Robin","K\u00f6hler, Herdis","Wachter, Astrid","Bleckmann, Annalen","Hasenfu\u00df, Gerd","Schillinger, Wolfgang"],"first_seen_on":"2016-08-18T04:39:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1557-2501"],"journal":"Journal of Invasive Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1471521917,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27529657?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27529657","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Use of the Impella Device for Acute Coronary Syndrome Complicated by Cardiogenic Shock - Experience From a Single Heart Center With Analysis of Long-term Mortality.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impella-device-acute-coronary-syndrome-complicated-cardiogenic-shock-experience-single-heart-center-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8243836,"mean":6.9683207276644,"rank":4382028,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2293920,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8243836,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253829,"mean":12.210294317411,"rank":139644,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":88507,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253829,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300,"mean":0.78722408026756,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":247,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.47727272727273,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DrSethdb\/statuses\/766132456999129088","license":"gnip","rt":["CardiologiaF"],"citation_ids":[10661451],"posted_on":"2016-08-18T04:39:46+00:00","author":{"name":"Seth Bilazarian, MD","url":"http:\/\/WWW.ProtectedPCI.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1590161549\/_MG_5470_normal.jpg","description":"Chief Medical Officer                      @AbiomedImpella                                              Tweets are my own","id_on_source":"DrSethdb","tweeter_id":"279808566","geo":{"lt":42.57509,"ln":-70.93005,"country":"US"},"followers":6500},"tweet_id":"766132456999129088"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BrianDrinkad\/statuses\/766244575455346689","license":"gnip","rt":["CardiologiaF"],"citation_ids":[10661451],"posted_on":"2016-08-18T12:05:17+00:00","author":{"name":"Brian Drinkard","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3628838736\/7c4ecd77945f87f3a9aa22169086295f_normal.jpeg","description":"tweets are my own.","id_on_source":"BrianDrinkad","tweeter_id":"1123952612","geo":{"lt":36.16589,"ln":-86.78444,"country":"US"},"followers":88},"tweet_id":"766244575455346689"}]}}
