Priming of social concepts was found to affect automatic processing in the Stroop effect. We investigated whether spatial coding measured by the SE can be affected by the observer's mental state. We used two social priming manipulations of impairments: one involving spatial processing - hemispatial neglect (HN) and another involving color perception - achromatopsia (ACHM). In two experiments the SE was reduced in the \"neglected\" visual field (VF) under the HN, but not under the ACHM manipulation. Our results show that spatial coding is sensitive to spatial representations that are not derived from task-relevant parameters, but from the observer's cognitive state. These findings dispute stimulus-response interference models grounded on the idea of the automaticity of spatial processing.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f61000378d","authors":["Isabel Arend","Daniela Aisenberg","Avishai Henik"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.concog.2016.08.008","endpage":"8","first_seen_on":"2016-08-18T07:36:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["10538100","1090-2376"],"journal":"Consciousness & Cognition","last_mentioned_on":1471539023,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1053810016302392"],"pmid":"27543899","pubdate":"2016-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Philosophy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["psychophysiology","psychology"],"title":"Social priming of hemispatial neglect affects spatial coding: Evidence from the Simon task","type":"article","volume":"45","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/social-priming-hemispatial-neglect-affects-spatial-coding-evidence-simon-task"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8243836,"mean":6.9683207276644,"rank":6255905,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1113055,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8243836,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253828,"mean":12.21021063953,"rank":180715,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":39452,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253828,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1022,"mean":13.591880509305,"rank":861,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":88,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1022,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":5.7206818181818,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
