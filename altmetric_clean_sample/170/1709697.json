In this process, a transfer DNA is delivered into the host genome, but it is still unclear how the host genome is altered by this event at single-base resolution. To decipher genomic discrepancy between GM crops and their host, we conducted whole-genome sequencing of a transgenic rice line OSCR11. This rice line expresses a seed-based edible vaccine containing two major pollen allergens, Cry j 1 and Cry j 2, against Japanese cedar pollinosis. We revealed that genetic differences between OSCR11 and its host a123 were significantly less than those between a123 and its precedent cultivar Koshihikari. The pattern of nucleotide base substitution in OSCR11, relative to a123, was consistent with somaclonal variation. Mutations in OSCR11 probably occurred during the cell culture steps. In addition, strand-specific mRNA-Seq revealed similar transcriptomes of a123 and OSCR11, supporting genomic integrity between them.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007156","authors":["Kawakatsu T","Kawahara Y","Itoh T","Takaiwa F"],"doi":"10.1093\/dnares\/dst036","first_seen_on":"2013-08-25T17:55:30+00:00","issns":["1340-2838"],"issue":"6","journal":"DNA Research","last_mentioned_on":1438784117,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23956243","http:\/\/dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2013\/08\/15\/dnares.dst036.abstract?cid=social_ionpublications16052284","http:\/\/dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/20\/6\/623.full","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3859328\/"],"pmid":"23956243","pubdate":"2013-08-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","genetics"],"title":"A Whole-Genome Analysis of a Transgenic Rice Seed-Based Edible Vaccine Against Cedar Pollen Allergy.","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/wholegenome-analysis-transgenic-rice-seedbased-edible-vaccine-against-cedar-pollen-allergy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5446915,"mean":6.3439212320952,"rank":1176226,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":4236921,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5446915,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100951,"mean":7.9837720851907,"rank":24321,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":76221,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100951,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":293,"mean":3.8727945205479,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":241,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":293,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":4.0833333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
