Carbohydrates have varied rates of digestion and absorption that induces different hormonal and metabolic responses in the body. Given the abundance of carbohydrate sources in the Philippines, the determination of the glycaemic index (GI) of local foods may prove beneficial in promoting health and decreasing the risk of diabetes in the country. Methods. The GI of Quality Protein Maize (QPM) grits, milled rice, and the mixture of these two food items were determined in ten female subjects. Using a randomized crossover design, the control bread and three test foods were given on separate occasions after an overnight fast. Blood samples were collected through finger prick at time intervals of 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min and analyzed for glucose concentrations. Results. The computed incremental area under the glucose response curve (IAUC) varies significantly across test foods (P < .0379) with the pure QPM grits yielding the lowest IAUC relative to the control by 46.38. Resulting GI values of the test foods (bootstrapped) were 80.36 (SEM 14.24), 119.78 (SEM 18.81), and 93.17 (SEM 27.27) for pure QPM grits, milled rice, and rice-QPM grits mixture, respectively. Conclusion. Pure QPM corn grits has a lower glycaemic response compared to milled rice and the rice-corn grits mixture, which may be related in part to differences in their dietary fibre composition and physicochemical characteristics. Pure QPM corn grits may be a more health beneficial food for diabetic and hyperlipidemic individuals.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f61000407f","authors":["Panlasigui LN","Bayaga CL","Barrios EB","Cochon KL"],"doi":"10.1155\/2010\/697842","first_seen_on":"2013-08-21T22:50:31+00:00","issns":["2090-0724"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Nutrition & Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1377125421,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/20862364\/?i=7&from=grits%20health"],"pmcid":"PMC2938446","pmid":"20862364","pubdate":"2010-09-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","title":"Glycaemic response to quality protein maize grits.","type":"article","volume":"2010","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/glycaemic-response-quality-protein-maize-grits"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635018,"mean":4.9199431259457,"rank":2017885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":945569,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635018,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":87953,"mean":7.5606607922505,"rank":45709,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":23536,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":87953,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117,"mean":3.6415344827586,"rank":66,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"ID":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/rauscha\/statuses\/370316972648824833","license":"public","citation_ids":[1703238],"posted_on":"2013-08-21T22:50:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Andrew Rausch","url":"http:\/\/www.andrewrausch.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/516224335544340480\/HgGMT2so_normal.jpeg","description":"Resident physician, home cook, coffee & cocktail geek.
