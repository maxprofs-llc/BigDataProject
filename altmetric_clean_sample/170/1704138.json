The aim of this study is to evaluate whether the effects of tramadol, clonazepam, and their combination on mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) complexes were influential at therapeutic or at progressively increasing doses. The study comprised of a total of 70 healthy male rats, aged 3 months. According to the drug intake regimen, animals were divided into seven groups: control, tramadol therapeutic, clonazepam therapeutic, combination therapeutic, tramadol abuse, clonazepam abuse, and combination abuse group. At the end of the experiment, brain mitochondrial ETC complexes (I, II, III, and IV) were evaluated. Histopathological examinations were also performed on brain tissues. The results showed that groups that received tramadol (therapeutic and abuse) suffered from weight loss. Tramadol abuse group and combination abuse group showed significant decrease in the activities of I, III, and IV complexes but not in the activity of complex II. In conclusion, tramadol but not clonazepam has been found to partially inhibit the activities of respiratory chain complexes I, III, and IV but not the activity of complex II and such inhibition occurred only at doses that exceeded the maximum recommended adult human daily therapeutic doses. This result explains the clinical and histopathological effects of tramadol, such as seizures and red neurons (marker for apoptosis), respectively.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f61000367b","authors":["Mohamed TM","Abdel Ghaffar HM","El Husseiny RM"],"doi":"10.1177\/0748233713491814","first_seen_on":"2013-08-22T09:31:31+00:00","issns":["0748-2337","1477-0393"],"issue":"12","journal":"Toxicology & Industrial Health","last_mentioned_on":1461719511,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23843224"],"pmid":"23843224","pubdate":"2013-07-13T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Environmental Science","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["occupationalmedicine"],"title":"Effects of tramadol, clonazepam, and their combination on brain mitochondrial complexes.","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-tramadol-clonazepam-combination-brain-mitochondrial-complexes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7615205,"mean":6.556701012339,"rank":3485728,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":3957692,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7615205,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":129259,"mean":6.9475637716816,"rank":49539,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":75907,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":129259,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":410,"mean":2.7522542787286,"rank":236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":168,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":410,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.0454545454545,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":4},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Neuroscience":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Unspecified":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"EG":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ChembearMu\/statuses\/689304430127280128","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[1704138],"posted_on":"2016-01-19T04:32:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Bearzapine,PharmC","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/868633428039696384\/r6y1mReb_normal.jpg","description":"Neuro Opioid Activity #\u00b5OR #NMDAR #Sigma #\u00b5 k\u2206\u2202 #Toxicology #MAGA #Behaviorlist #\u00b5Receptors Professes his faith to Jesus #2A Constitution  #ANTIGLOBAL","id_on_source":"ChembearMu","tweeter_id":"3429073925","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1696},"tweet_id":"689304430127280128"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ChembearMu\/statuses\/692560921634410496","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[1704138],"posted_on":"2016-01-28T04:12:45+00:00","author":{"name":"Bearzapine,PharmC","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/868633428039696384\/r6y1mReb_normal.jpg","description":"Neuro Opioid Activity #\u00b5OR #NMDAR #Sigma #\u00b5 k\u2206\u2202 #Toxicology #MAGA #Behaviorlist #\u00b5Receptors Professes his faith to Jesus #2A Constitution  #ANTIGLOBAL","id_on_source":"ChembearMu","tweeter_id":"3429073925","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1696},"tweet_id":"692560921634410496"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/rhusseiny\/statuses\/370477997586780160","license":"public","citation_ids":[1704138],"posted_on":"2013-08-22T09:30:12+00:00","author":{"name":"dr.Husseini","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/rhusseiny","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000332158909\/8d7e0c496eedcd1b9ae166625fce7062_normal.jpeg","description":"Ph.D of Biochemistry Genetics","id_on_source":"rhusseiny","tweeter_id":"315947057","followers":11},"tweet_id":"370477997586780160"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OxycoNMDAmu\/statuses\/725130302331432960","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[1704138],"posted_on":"2016-04-27T01:11:51+00:00","author":{"name":"Bearzapine,PharmC","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/868633428039696384\/r6y1mReb_normal.jpg","description":"Neuro Opioid Activity #\u00b5OR #NMDAR #Sigma #\u00b5 k\u2206\u2202 #Toxicology #MAGA #Behaviorlist #\u00b5Receptors Professes his faith to Jesus #2A Constitution  #ANTIGLOBAL","id_on_source":"OxycoNMDAmu","tweeter_id":"3429073925","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1696},"tweet_id":"725130302331432960"}]}}
