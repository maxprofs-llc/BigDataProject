Starting with a retrospective review of trends in the twentieth-century, the series has covered 6 different regions, with contributions from 21 countries. As this is the half-way point in the survey, it seems a useful point at which to reflect on what has emerged so far. The method of content analysis is used to identify key trends. The top five trends are explored.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029c0","authors":["Murphy, Jeannette"],"doi":"10.1111\/hir.12034","endpage":"252","first_seen_on":"2013-08-25T00:27:14+00:00","issns":["1471-1842","1471-1834"],"issue":"3","journal":"Health Information & Libraries Journal","last_mentioned_on":1382480588,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/hir.12034\/abstract;jsessionid=D15718E674D7D866F043A4A61ADF7433.d04t04","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/hir.12034\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/hir.12034\/pdf","pmid":"23981026","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Library And Information Studies","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Health Professions","Social Sciences"],"startpage":"245","subjects":["healthservices","medicalinformatics"],"title":"International trends in health science libraria\u00e2\u0080\u0090 nship: Part 7 Taking stock","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/international-trends-health-science-libraria-nship-part-7-taking-stock"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6330725,"mean":5.9768190153299,"rank":2591090,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3599190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6330725,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105283,"mean":7.8770693375886,"rank":43273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":58705,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105283,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":223,"mean":3.5711621621622,"rank":122,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":93,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":223,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":5,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":6,"Computer Science":1,"Arts and Humanities":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1},"mendeley":{"US":1,"BR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/LA_MedLibrarian\/status\/392778172552323073","license":"public","citation_ids":[1709138],"posted_on":"2013-10-22T22:23:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Lee-Anne Ufholz","url":"http:\/\/www.chla-absc.ca","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/905145541583044608\/MdYynRZh_normal.jpg","description":"Regional Sales Manager, Wolters Kluwer Health.
