Through ligand tuning, the size of the Cu12Sb4S13 NCs may be increased from 6 to 18 nm. Phase purity is achieved through optimizing the ligand chemistry and maximizing the reactivity of the antimony precursor. We provide a detailed investigation of the optical and photoelectrical properties of both tetrahedrite (Cu12Sb4S13) and famatinite (Cu3SbS4) NCs. These NCs were found to have very high absorption coefficients reaching 10(5) cm(-1) and band gaps of 1.7 and 1 eV for tetrahedrite and famatinite NCs, respectively. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy was employed to determine the band positions. In each case, the Fermi energies reside close to the valence band, indicative of a p-type semiconductor. Annealing of tetrahedrite CAS NC films in sulfur vapor at 350 \u00b0C was found to result in pure famatinite NC films, opening the possibility to tune the crystal structure within thin films of these NCs. Photoelectrochemistry of hydrazine free unannealed films displays a strong p-type photoresponse, with up to 0.1 mA\/cm(2) measured under mild illumination. Collectively these optical properties make CAS NCs an excellent new candidate for both thin film and hybrid solar cells and as strong NIR absorbers in general.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Joel van Embden","van Embden J","Latham K","Duffy NW","Tachibana Y"],"doi":"10.1021\/ja402702x","endpage":"11571","first_seen_on":"2013-08-23T23:19:12+00:00","issns":["0002-7863","1520-5126"],"issue":"31","journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1385565296,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/doi:10.1021\/ja402702x","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23876109","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ja402702x"],"pmid":"23876109","pubdate":"2013-07-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"11562","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Near-Infrared Absorbing Cu12Sb4S13 and Cu3SbS4 Nanocrystals: Synthesis, Characterization, and Photoelectrochemistry","type":"article","volume":"135","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nearinfrared-absorbing-cu12sb4s13-cu3sbs4-nanocrystals-synthesis-characterization-photoelectrochemis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":33,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":33},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628883,"mean":4.937418267118,"rank":77219,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":3551533,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628883,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":87995,"mean":7.5891483964818,"rank":3922,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":84065,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":87995,"percentile":95},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12981,"mean":4.1081269645609,"rank":130,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":12850,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12981,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":440,"mean":4.0380227790433,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":434,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":440,"percentile":98}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
