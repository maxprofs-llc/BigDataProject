Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene mutations have been analyzed by using molecular detection methods based on the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), artificial constructed restriction sites (ACRS) PCR and direct DNA sequencing. 56.4% of the patients had cPKU. A mutation detection rate of 79.49% was achieved and sixteen different mutations were found: missense 56.25%, splice site 37.5%, and frameshift 6.25%. The predominant mutation in this population sample was p.R261Q G>A, p.F55>Lfs and p.R243Q G>A. No mutation in six PKU patients was observed. In 57.9% of patient genotypes, the metabolic phenotype could be predicted. The identification of the mutations in the PAH gene and the genotype-phenotype correlation should facilitate the evaluation of metabolic phenotypes, diagnosis, implementation of optimal dietary therapy, and determination of prognosis in the patients and genetic counseling for the patient's relatives.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002932","authors":["Murad H","Dabboul A","Moassas F","Alasmar D","Al-Achkar W"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.gene.2013.07.001","first_seen_on":"2013-08-24T15:55:44+00:00","issns":["0378-1119","03781119"],"journal":"Gene","last_mentioned_on":1377359719,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0378111913008524?via=ihub&cc=y"],"pmid":"23856132","pubdate":"2013-07-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Mutation spectrum of phenylketonuria in Syrian population: Genotype\u2013phenotype correlation ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mutation-spectrum-phenylketonuria-syrian-population-genotypephenotype-correlation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630293,"mean":4.9302727339889,"rank":2899767,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":79240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630293,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88167,"mean":7.6075518680673,"rank":70049,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":350,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88167,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3488,"mean":2.3468993404072,"rank":2743,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":237,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3488,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":1.4731111111111,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
