Rheumatoid synovial tissue produces IL-17A, which causes cartilage and bone degradation in synovial and bone explants. Overexpression of IL-17A induces synovial inflammation and joint destruction in animal RA models. These effects are attenuated in IL-17A-deficient animals and by agents that block IL-17A. Serum IL-17A levels and, to a greater extent, synovial fluid IL-17A levels are elevated in many patients with RA. In some RA cohorts, higher IL-17A levels have been associated with a more severe clinical course. Several IL-17A blockers, including the anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibodies secukinumab and ixekizumab, and the anti-IL-17 receptor subunit A monoclonal antibody brodalumab have been evaluated in phase II clinical trials. Of these, secukinumab is the most advanced with respect to clinical evaluation in RA, with phase III trials ongoing in patients on background methotrexate who had inadequate responses to previous tumor necrosis factor blocker therapy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008b55","authors":["Herbert Kellner"],"doi":"10.1177\/1759720x13485328","endpage":"152","first_seen_on":"2013-08-21T01:24:37+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1759-7218","1759-720X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Therapeutic Advances in Musculoskeletal Disease","last_mentioned_on":1378004784,"links":["http:\/\/tab.sagepub.com\/content\/5\/3\/141"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/tab.sagepub.com\/content\/5\/3\/141.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3707345","pmid":"23858337","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"141","title":"Targeting interleukin-17 in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis: rationale and clinical potential","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/targeting-interleukin17-patients-active-rheumatoid-arthritis-rationale-clinical-potential"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":790410,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":3713460,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93026,"mean":7.7194022252085,"rank":19830,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":73102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93026,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":3.2247575757576,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
