Environmental lead exposure increases hyperactivity and sensory defensiveness, two traits likely to increase classroom misbehavior and subsequent discipline. Childhood Blood Lead Level (BLL) test results categorized urban fourth graders as exposed (2687; lifetime max BLL 10-20 \u00b5g\/dL) or unexposed (1076; no lifetime BLL \u22655 \u00b5g\/dL). Exposed children were over twice as likely as unexposed children to be suspended (OR=2.66, 95% CI=[2.12, 3.32]), controlling for covariates. African American children were more likely to be suspended than white children, but lead exposure explained 23% of the racial discipline gap. These results suggest that different rates of environmental lead exposure may contribute to the racial discipline gap.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027ee","authors":["Amato MS","Magzamen S","Imm P","Havlena JA","Anderson HA","Kanarek MS","Moore CF","Michael S.
