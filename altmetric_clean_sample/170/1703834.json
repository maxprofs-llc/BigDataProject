Complications resulting from prolapse of the uterus in pregnancy vary from minor cervical infection to spontaneous abortion, and include preterm labor and maternal and fetal mortality as well as acute urinary retention and urinary tract infection. Moreover, affected women may be at particular risk of dystocia during labor that could necessitate emergency intervention for delivery. Recommendations regarding the management of this infrequent but potentially harmful condition are scarce and outdated. This review will examine the causative factors of uterine prolapse and the antepartum, intrapartum and puerperal complications that may arise from this condition as well as therapeutic options available to the obstetrician. While early recognition and appropriate prenatal management of uterine prolapse during pregnancy is imperative, implementation of conservative treatment modalities throughout pregnancy, these applied in accordance with the severity of the uterus prolapse and the patient's preference, may be sufficient to achieve uneventful pregnancy and normal, spontaneous delivery.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610004043","authors":["Tsikouras P","Dafopoulos A","Vrachnis N","Iliodromiti Z","Bouchlariotou S","Pinidis P","Tsagias N","Liberis V","Galazios G","Friedrich Von Tempelhoff G"],"doi":"10.3109\/14767058.2013.807235","first_seen_on":"2013-08-22T05:18:44+00:00","issns":["1476-7058"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Maternal-Fetal & Neonatal Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1377148696,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/23692627\/?i=16&from=pregnancy%20urinary%20complications"],"pmid":"23692627","pubdate":"2013-05-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Informa UK Ltd.
