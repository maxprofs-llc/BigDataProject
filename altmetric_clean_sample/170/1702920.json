Herein, we investigated the presence and seasonal activity of Ixodes ricinus ticks from 10 urban and suburban sites in two different geographical areas of southeastern and northeastern Slovakia during 2008-2010. Our aim was to study the abundance of ticks in correlation with the environmental factors and their infection with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Neoehrlichia mikurensis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000883","doi":"10.1186\/1756-3305-6-238","first_seen_on":"2013-08-21T19:41:30+00:00","issns":["1756-3305"],"issue":"1","journal":"Parasites & Vectors","last_mentioned_on":1377114026,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23952975"],"pmid":"23952975","pubdate":"2013-08-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Entomology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Parasitology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Tropical Medicine","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"Ixodes ricinus abundance and its infection with the tick-borne pathogens in urban and suburban areas of Eastern Slovakia.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ixodes-ricinus-abundance-infection-tickborne-pathogens-urban-suburban-areas-eastern-slovakia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633255,"mean":4.9221505741186,"rank":2897959,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":81857,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633255,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":87911,"mean":7.5620707996817,"rank":69748,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":418,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":87911,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":822,"mean":2.4776175395859,"rank":588,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":822,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":3.479347826087,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
