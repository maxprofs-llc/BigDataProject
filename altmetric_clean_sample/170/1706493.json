Previous research has shown that TOJ in the presence of synchronized periodic conditioning stimuli impairs TOJ performance, and this phenomenon is suggested to be mediated by GABAergic interneurons that cause perceptual binding across the two skin sites. Application of continuous theta-burst repetitive TMS (cTBS) over primary somatosensory cortex (SI) alters temporal and spatial tactile perception. The purpose of this study was to examine TOJ perception in the presence and absence of synchronized periodic conditioning stimuli before and after cTBS applied over left-hemisphere SI. A TOJ task was administered on the right index and middle finger (D2 and D3) in two separate sessions in the presence and absence of conditioning stimuli (a background low amplitude sinusoidal vibration).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007cd","authors":["Kevin GH Lee","Mark F Jacobs","Michael J Asmussen","Christopher M Zapallow","Mark Tommerdahl","Aimee J Nelson"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2202-14-89","first_seen_on":"2013-08-23T08:42:45+00:00","issns":["1471-2202"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1377978529,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2202\/14\/89\/abstract"],"pmid":"23968301","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Animal Models","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurobiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"89","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Continuous theta-burst stimulation modulates tactile synchronization","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/continuous-thetaburst-stimulation-modulates-tactile-synchronization"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":1989134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2419574,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93280,"mean":7.7185048510385,"rank":38440,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":52410,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93280,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":640,"mean":2.8610234741784,"rank":262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":344,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":640,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":2.8124736842105,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
