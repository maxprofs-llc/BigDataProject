Although the frequency of exacerbations increases as the disease progresses, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are largely unknown, and there is a need for a simple in vivo exacerbation model. In this study, we compared four groups of mice treated with PBS alone, elastase alone, LPS alone, and elastase plus LPS. A single intratracheal administration of LPS to mice with elastase-induced emphysema provoked infiltration of inflammatory cells, especially CD8(+) T cells, into alveolar spaces and increased matrix metalloproteinase-9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, and perforin production in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid at the acute inflammatory phase compared with the other groups. We also measured the percentage of low-attenuation area (LAA%) in the above mice using micro-computed X-ray tomography. The LAA% was the most sensitive parameter for quantitative assessments of emphysema among all the parameters evaluated. Using the parameter of LAA%, we found significantly more severe alveolar destruction in the group treated with elastase plus LPS compared with the other groups during long-term longitudinal observations. We built three-dimensional images of the emphysema and confirmed that the lungs of elastase plus LPS-treated mice contained larger emphysematous areas than mice treated with elastase alone. Although human exacerbation of COPD is clinically and pathologically complicated, this simple mouse model mimics human cases to some extent and will be useful for elucidating its mechanism and developing therapeutic strategies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f61000698a","authors":["Satoshi Kobayashi","Reiko Fujinawa","Fumi Ota","Shiho Kobayashi","Takashi Angata","Manabu Ueno","Toshitaka Maeno","Shinobu Kitazume","Keiichi Yoshida","Takeo Ishii","Congxiao Gao","Kazuaki Ohtsubo","Yoshiki Yamaguchi","Tomoko Betsuyaku","Kozui Kida","Naoyuki Taniguchi"],"doi":"10.1165\/rcmb.2013-0074oc","first_seen_on":"2013-08-24T08:28:07+00:00","issns":["1044-1549","1535-4989"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1377265201,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1165\/rcmb.2013-0074OC","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23822858"],"pmid":"23822858","pubdate":"2013-07-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"130703075753000","subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"A Single Dose of LPS into Mice with Emphysema Mimics Human COPD Exacerbation as Assessed by Micro-CT","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/single-dose-lipopolysaccharide-mice-emphysema-mimics-human-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-exa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7394895,"mean":6.4269943728701,"rank":1002253,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6327729,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7394895,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128654,"mean":6.9497058910404,"rank":18805,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":108757,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128654,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1005,"mean":2.6578944223108,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":957,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1005,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":2.5414090909091,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
