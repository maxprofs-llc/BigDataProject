Speech of this sort may be caused by serious medical conditions such as cerebral irritation and acute confusional states, but in this case it was most probably part of a sleepwalking episode associated with jetlag. Abnormal speech during sleepwalking has been described, but it is not well characterised. This report of somniloquy offers some descriptive phenomenology for such speech.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc98","authors":["Hurwitz, Brian","Richardson, Joshua"],"doi":"10.1136\/bcr.01.2010.2621","first_seen_on":"2013-08-22T19:23:20+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1757-790X"],"journal":"BMJ Case Reports","last_mentioned_on":1377199389,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22767364?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC3027346","pmid":"22767364","pubdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Abnormal talk by a 14-year-old boy with hypersomnolence after a long-haul flight.","type":"article","volume":"2010","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/abnormal-talk-14yearold-boy-hypersomnolence-after-longhaul-flight"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3069772,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":946273,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93051,"mean":7.7222902955402,"rank":63246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":18259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93051,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2076,"mean":2.9554139759036,"rank":1146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":676,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2076,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96,"mean":2.5058947368421,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
