We examined the impact of integrated TB\/HIV care on clinical and survival outcomes in rural western Guatemala. Prospective data from 254 newly diagnosed TB\/HIV patients (99 enrolled in the pre-integrated program from August 2005 to July 2006, and 155 enrolled in the integrated program from February 2008 to January 2009) showed no significant baseline differences between clients in the two periods. They were principally male (65.5 %), Mayan (71 %), median age 33 years, and CD4 count averaged 111 cells\/mm\u00b3. TB\/HIV co-infected patients were more likely to receive antiretroviral therapy in the integrated program than in the pre-integrated program (72 vs. 22 %, respectively) and had lower mortality (HR 0.22, 95 % CI 0.14\u20130.33). This study shows how using a TB setting as the entry point for integrated TB\/HIV care can improve health outcomes for HIV-positive patients in rural Guatemala.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f6100056e0","authors":["Ikeda JM","L\u00f3pez Tellez CA","Hudes ES","Page K","Evans J","Racancoj O","Hearst N"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10461-013-0595-9","first_seen_on":"2013-08-24T21:42:01+00:00","issns":["1573-3254"],"issue":"","journal":"AIDS & Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1408789563,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23959143","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s10461-013-0595-9"],"pmid":"23959143","pubdate":"2013-08-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Health Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome","behavioralsciences"],"title":"Impact of Integrating HIV and TB Care and Treatment in a Regional Tuberculosis Hospital in Rural Guatemala","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-integrating-hiv-tb-care-treatment-regional-tuberculosis-hospital-rural-guatemala"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8399037,"mean":7.0727657654921,"rank":3774995,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4531213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8399037,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132937,"mean":7.1892728982369,"rank":48509,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":82676,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132937,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1875,"mean":4.3397588046958,"rank":1014,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":811,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1875,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":5.8757575757576,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":6,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":3,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":7,"Social Sciences":3,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":7,"Business, Management and Accounting":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2,"GB":1},"mendeley":{"US":1,"BR":1,"GB":1,"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/HIV_Insight\/status\/503125799432888320","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1709078],"posted_on":"2014-08-23T10:25:12+00:00","author":{"name":"HIV Insight","url":"http:\/\/hiv-insight.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/587408973\/INSIGHT_ICON_normal.gif","description":"HIV, AIDS, STI, STD, HPV, Sexuality, LGBT, et al.
