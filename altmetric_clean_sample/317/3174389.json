With the advent of pathogen reduction technologies and improved testing that can greatly reduce the risk for bacterial contamination, the platelet storage lesion is emerging as the main challenge to increasing the shelf life of platelet concentrates. This article discusses the contribution of platelet production methods to the storage lesion, long-established and newly developed methods used to determine platelet quality, and the significance for clinical transfusion outcome. Highlighted are the novel technologies applied to platelet storage including platelet additive solutions and pathogen inactivation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005816","authors":["Devine DV","Serrano K"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cll.2010.02.002","first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T00:38:16+00:00","issns":["02722712"],"issue":"2","journal":"Clinics in laboratory medicine","last_mentioned_on":1417365002,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.cll.2010.02.002","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20513565"],"pmid":"20513565","pubdate":"2010-01-06T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques"],"title":"The platelet storage lesion.","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/platelet-storage-lesion"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4565650,"mean":5.3760928148882,"rank":1056683,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2939859,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4565650,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":152350,"mean":8.8234750868074,"rank":44186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":106240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":152350,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90,"mean":2.0737303370787,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":58,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.41666666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Ph.
