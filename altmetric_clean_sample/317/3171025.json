Pain was measured on a visual analogue scale using 0 and 10 as anchors. Presenting symptoms including numbness, tingling, burning, and pain did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. There was significant pain reduction across the 45-minute period for both groups. However, t test comparisons found no significant differences between the groups for beginning pain, pain at 15 minutes, pain at 30 minutes, or pain at 45 minutes. The use of a magnet for reducing pain attributed to carpal tunnel syndrome was no more effective than use of the placebo device.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f43cf058f610002da2","authors":["Richard Carter","Cheryl B Aspy","James Mold"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-30T23:33:23+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0094-3509"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Family Practice","last_mentioned_on":1346950842,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11927062"],"pmid":"11927062","pubdate":"2002-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["primaryhealthcare"],"title":"The effectiveness of magnet therapy for treatment of wrist pain attributed to carpal tunnel syndrome.","type":"article","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effectiveness-magnet-therapy-treatment-wrist-pain-attributed-carpal-tunnel-syndrome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4280204,"mean":5.0260385622132,"rank":1636653,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":2610888,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4280204,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138849,"mean":8.3737804217565,"rank":46441,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":91018,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138849,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":440,"mean":1.7936264236902,"rank":115,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":325,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":440,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":0.58333333333333,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
