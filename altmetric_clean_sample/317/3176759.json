It can no longer be considered the rare and bizarre syndrome that it was once thought to be. The concepts surrounding TS, and our understanding of it, are also becoming increasingly complex and, in some individuals, TS is now recognized to be associated with a wide variety of associated behaviours and psychopathologies. It is suggested that TS is heterogeneous from a variety of standpoints including clinical presentation and psychopathology, and thus neuropharmacological responses and possibly even aetiological and genetic mechanisms. In this paper, mention is made of recent findings in epidemiology and genetics, highlighting the complexities of the disorder; these have been chosen because findings in both areas have clinical and management implications. The literature on the clinical manifestations, associated behaviours, psychopathology (and\/or comorbid conditions) and management, in particular, is reviewed in detail.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000242e","authors":["M M Robertson","Robertson, M M"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T01:36:55+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["0006-8950"],"journal":"Brain: A Journal of Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1294431595,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10686169","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10686169"],"pmid":"10686169","pubdate":"2000-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["brain","neurology"],"title":"Tourette syndrome, associated conditions and the complexities of treatment.","type":"article","volume":"123 Pt 3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tourette-syndrome-associated-conditions-complexities-treatment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3832300,"mean":5.0341292990817,"rank":879613,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2422393,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3832300,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117052,"mean":8.9796153129834,"rank":34612,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":81101,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117052,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2618,"mean":8.5354184180359,"rank":1069,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":1233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2618,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":20.778734693878,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":13,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":11,"Researcher":22,"Student  > Ph.
