These symptoms were more marked when the abuse was intrafamilial, involved force, or occurred before the victim was 14 years old. Further research is required to establish the causal links between the phenomena of sexual abuse and bulimic symptoms.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100057a0","authors":["G Waller","Waller, G","G.
