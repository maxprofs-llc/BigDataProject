Cytoplasmic GSH was labelled with monochlorobimane (MCB) in situ to give a fluorescent GSH-bimane (GSB) conjugate. At low (10-100 microM) concentrations of MCB, labelling was mediated by a glutathione S-transferase, which confers specificity for GSH. HPLC analysis of MCB-labelled low molecular-weight thiols showed that the assay measures the total GSH pool, including the oxidized glutathione. The progress curve for the labelling could be described using Michaelis-Menten kinetics with an apparent KM of 40 microM and Vmax of 470 micromol lcyt -1 min-1. There was no evidence for de novo synthesis of GSH during the labelling period of 2 h, suggesting that control of GSH synthesis is not mediated by feedback control of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase in this system. The total cellular level of GSH was calculated from the plateau value of the progress curve, after appropriate calibration, as 830-942 nmol g-1 FW. The volume fraction of cytoplasm was measured from serial optical sections of bimane-labelled cells collected by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) with excitation 442 nm, or two-photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM) with excitation 770 nm. A value of 42 +\/- 3% cytoplasm was determined by manual segmentation, and a value of 37 +\/- 2% using stereological techniques. Using these figures, values for cytoplasmic [GSH] were estimated to be between 2.7 +\/- 0.3 and 3.2 +\/- 0.3 mM for cell populations. In addition, measurement of GSH levels in individual cells using CLSM and TPLSM gave values of 3.0 +\/- 0.5 and 3.5 +\/- 0.7 mM, respectively.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003338","authors":["A J Meyer","M J May","M Fricker"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T00:00:10+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0960-7412"],"issue":"1","journal":"Plant Journal","last_mentioned_on":1245856254,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11489184"],"pmid":"11489184","pubdate":"2001-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology","botany"],"title":"Quantitative in vivo measurement of glutathione in Arabidopsis cells.","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quantitative-vivo-measurement-glutathione-arabidopsis-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631265,"mean":4.9266893682253,"rank":816084,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2292949,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631265,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95250,"mean":8.1243987023488,"rank":24870,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69281,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95250,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1848,"mean":1.9469983757445,"rank":216,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":1432,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1848,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":1.7089285714286,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Ph.
