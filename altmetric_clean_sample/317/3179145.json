However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are only partially understood at present. In this study, we used proteomic approaches and network reconstruction to clarify the mechanism of pardaxin-induced apoptosis in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells. We identified that pardaxin-regulated proteins predominantly function in the unfolded protein response, oxidative stress and cytoskeletal distribution. Molecular examination of signal transduction and cellular localization demonstrated that the activator protein-1 transcription factor was activated, which eventually caused apoptosis via both caspase- and apoptosis-inducing factor-dependent pathways. Scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) alleviated c-Jun activation, and small interfering RNA knockdown of c-Jun abrogated pardaxin-induced caspase activation and cell death, thereby implicating ROS and c-Jun in pardaxin-induced apoptosis signaling. In summary, this study provides the first protein-interacting network maps and novel insights into the biological responses and potential toxicity of pardaxin.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024a7","authors":["Tsui-Chin Huang","Jyh-Yih Chen"],"doi":"10.1093\/carcin\/bgt130","first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T02:40:22+00:00","issns":["1460-2180"],"journal":"Carcinogenesis","last_mentioned_on":1401487488,"links":["http:\/\/carcin.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/34\/8\/1833.long","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/carcin\/bgt130"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/carcin.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/34\/8\/1833.full.pdf","pmid":"23615400","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Proteomic analysis reveals that pardaxin triggers apoptotic signaling pathways in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells: cross talk among the UPR, c-Jun and ROS","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/proteomic-analysis-reveals-pardaxin-triggers-apoptotic-signaling-pathways-human-cervical-carcinoma-h"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3821408,"mean":5.02969664561,"rank":876546,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2414873,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3821408,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116366,"mean":8.9728869849183,"rank":34326,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":80717,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116366,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":927,"mean":4.1137732181425,"rank":147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":600,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":927,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.6961538461538,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
