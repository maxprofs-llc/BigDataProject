However, healthy subjects found to be deficient in Hex A activity (i.e., pseudodeficient) by means of in vitro biochemical tests have been described. We analyzed the HEXA gene of one pseudodeficient subject and identified both a C739-to-T substitution that changes Arg247----Trp on one allele and a previously identified Tay-Sachs disease mutation on the second allele. Six additional pseudodeficient subjects were found to have the C739-to-T mutation. This allele accounted for 32% (20\/62) of non-Jewish enzyme-defined Tay-Sachs disease carriers but for none of 36 Jewish enzyme-defined carriers who did not have one of three known mutations common to this group. The C739-to-T allele, together with a \"true\" Tay-Sachs disease allele, causes Hex A pseudodeficiency. Given both the large proportion of non-Jewish carriers with this allele and that standard biochemical screening cannot differentiate between heterozygotes for the C739-to-T mutations and Tay-Sachs disease carriers, DNA testing for this mutation in at-risk couples is essential. This could prevent unnecessary or incorrect prenatal diagnoses.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021ff","authors":["B L Triggs-Raine","E H Mules","M M Kaback","J S Lim-Steele","C E Dowling","B R Akerman","M R Natowicz","E E Grebner","R Navon","J P Welch"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T01:35:36+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0002-9297"],"issue":"4","journal":"American Journal of Human Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1325102903,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1384323","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1682803"],"pmcid":"PMC1682803","pmid":"1384323","pubdate":"1992-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"A pseudodeficiency allele common in non-Jewish Tay-Sachs carriers: Implications for carrier screening","type":"article","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pseudodeficiency-allele-common-nonjewish-taysachs-carriers-implications-carrier-screening"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4565650,"mean":5.3760928148882,"rank":1056684,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2939856,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4565650,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":152350,"mean":8.8234750868074,"rank":44186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":106240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":152350,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3173,"mean":6.8606122320303,"rank":1036,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":922,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3173,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":30.229133333333,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
