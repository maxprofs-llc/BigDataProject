Although expressed by and acting at epithelial surfaces, little is known about their specific interaction with epithelial structures. Here, we identify the transmembrane protein CD98 as a cell surface receptor involved in the internalization of human \u03b2-defensin 3 (hBD3) in human epithelial A549 cells. CD98 and hBD3 extensively colocalize on the basolateral domain of A549. While verifying their direct binding by fluorescence resonance energy transfer and surface plasmon resonance, we mapped the interaction to CD98 residues 304-414, i.e. to the region known to interact with the proteins of intestinal bacteria during colonic invasion. Treatment of A549 cells with hBD3 dramatically reduces CD98 expression and conversely, knockdown of CD98 expression impairs hBD3 cell surface binding and internalization. Competition for bacterial binding to CD98 and downregulation of CD98 expression may represent novel mechanisms for the antibacterial activity of hBD3.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024f0","doi":"10.1016\/j.chembiol.2014.11.020","first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T02:12:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1074-5521"],"journal":"Chemistry & Biology","last_mentioned_on":1422639111,"links":["http:\/\/www.cell.com\/chemistry-biology\/abstract\/S1074-5521(14)00461-X"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S107455211400461X\/pdf","pmid":"25641165","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry","biology","biochemistry"],"title":"Membrane Protein 4F2\/CD98 Is a Cell Surface Receptor Involved in the Internalization and Trafficking of Human \u03b2-Defensin 3 in Epithelial Cells","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/membrane-protein-4f2cd98-cell-surface-receptor-involved-internalization-trafficking-human-%CE%B2defensin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036026,"mean":5.9656490211997,"rank":4196618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036026,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179590,"mean":8.6056941460781,"rank":143709,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179590,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":904,"mean":4.8632558139535,"rank":842,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":904,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":15.924615384615,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CellChemBiol\/status\/561215226381869057","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3178166],"posted_on":"2015-01-30T17:31:51+00:00","author":{"name":"CellChemicalBiology","url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/cell-chemical-biology\/home","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/690260809876946946\/sjFBATod_normal.jpg","description":"Cell Chemical Biology is a #chemicalbiology journal.
