This has been attributed by many to improved hygiene. The frequent failure of conventional pharmaceuticals to manage the disease has led to the introduction of parasites as a potential alternative therapy for asthma and other immunological diseases. In this article, we briefly review the immunological rationale underpinning therapeutic parasitic infection, describe recently initiated trials, and highlight potential risks and benefits of introducing parasites into patient cohorts.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036b3","authors":["Falcone FH","Pritchard DI","Franco H.
