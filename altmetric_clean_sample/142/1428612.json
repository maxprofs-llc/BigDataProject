The parameters evaluated were: bradylalia, flapping tremor, performance, visual evoked potentials and the trial making test. Both treatments were combined with lactulose. The analysis of results showed a rate of positive results in the patients treated with rifaximine greater than that with neomycin. Differences, however, were not significant.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9213cf058f61000d8d0","authors":["Di Piazza, S","Gabriella Filippazzo, M","Valenza, L M","Morello, S","Pastore, L","Conti, A","Cottone, S","Pagliaro, L"],"first_seen_on":"2013-05-02T23:38:17+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0392-0623"],"issue":"7","journal":"Italian journal of gastroenterology","last_mentioned_on":1271122380,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1742538?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"1742538","pubdate":"1991-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Rifaximine versus neomycin in the treatment of portosystemic encephalopathy.","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rifaximine-versus-neomycin-treatment-portosystemic-encephalopathy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.528,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.528},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":850066,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":4186322,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93517,"mean":7.1892292869671,"rank":17566,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":75949,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93517,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":4.4056,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Rifaximin for Prevention of Hepatic Encephalopathy","url":"http:\/\/feedproxy.google.com\/~r\/PallimedAPalliativeMedicineBlog\/~3\/8pTZBCIMF5U\/rifaximin-for-prevention-of-hepatic.html","license":"public","citation_ids":[131846,1428610,1428612,1317070],"posted_on":"2010-04-13T01:33:00+00:00","summary":"Looking for a medication that can reduce a troubling symptom in an advanced disease and reduce hospitalization?
