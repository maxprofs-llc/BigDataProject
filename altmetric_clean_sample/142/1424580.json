PM"],"citation":{"abstract":"microRNA (miR)-205 is downregulated and acts as a tumor suppressor in human melanoma cells. Previously, for clinical application, we added aromatic benzene-pyridine (BP-type) analogs to the 3'-overhang region of the RNA-strand and changed the sequences of the passenger strand in the miR-143 duplex. Here, we demonstrated the antitumor effect in vitro and in vivo of miR-205 that was also chemically modified by BP and had altered passenger sequence. In in vitro experiments, transfection with the synthetic miR-205 (miR-205BP\/S3) significantly inhibited the growth of human melanoma cells. Exogenous miR-205BP\/S3 suppressed the protein expression levels of E2F1 and VEGF, which are validated targets of miR-205-5p, and BCL2, a transcribed molecule of E2F1, as did Pre-miR-205, used as a miR-205 mimic having the wild-type sequence. On the basis of the results of a luciferase activity assay, miR-205BP\/S3 directly targeted E2F1, as did Pre-miR-205. However, miR-205BP\/S3 was much more resistant to RNase than Pre-miR-205 in fetal bovine serum and to RNase in mice xenografted with human melanoma tissues. In addition, the intratumoral injection of miR-205BP\/S3 exhibited a significant antitumor effect compared with the case of control miRNA or Pre-miR-205 in human melanoma cell-xenografted mice. These findings indicate that miR-205BP\/S3 is a possible promising therapeutic modality for melanoma.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5083cf058f61000311d","doi":"10.1038\/mt.2013.70","first_seen_on":"2013-05-01T11:58:56+00:00","issns":["1525-0024"],"journal":"Molecular Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1367409391,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23629002?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23629002","pubdate":"2013-04-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Chemically Modified Synthetic microRNA-205 Inhibits the Growth of Melanoma Cells In Vitro and In Vivo.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chemically-modified-synthetic-microrna205-inhibits-growth-melanoma-cells-vitro-vivo-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":4203152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93813,"mean":7.1754929220144,"rank":76981,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93813,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":975,"mean":6.4944004106776,"rank":904,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":975,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":9.2104324324324,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/VEGFRSSfeeds\/statuses\/329564992296845312","license":"public","citation_ids":[1424580],"posted_on":"2013-05-01T11:56:31+00:00","author":{"name":"VEGF RSS Feeds","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/516588600\/VEGF_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"VEGFRSSfeeds","tweeter_id":"88511740","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":363},"tweet_id":"329564992296845312"}]}}
