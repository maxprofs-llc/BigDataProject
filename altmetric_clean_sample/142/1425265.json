Its incidence has greatly increased in recent years. The main vector is a tick of the Ixodes family. Clinical manifestations are multiple and show the multi-organ character of the disease. In terms of frequency, joint and neurological presentations, respectively more frequent in North America and Europe, are the main manifestations after cutaneous symptoms, of which erythema migrans is the most common, followed by cardiac and ocular signs. Other signs exist but are anecdotal. Neuroborreliosis manifests itself most often with peripheral facial palsy, but there are other clinical forms, which include acute myelitis (4-5% of neuroborreliosis). We present here the case of a 16-year-old teenager with acute myelitis and meningeal involvement due to Lyme disease, who presented with atypical symptoms (massive and rapid weight loss, vomiting). MRI showed localized marrow edema as well as leptomeningeal and root enhancement. Lumbar puncture showed lymphocytic pleocytosis. Lyme serology was positive both in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Even if acute myelitis remains exceptional among neuroborreliosis manifestations, this diagnosis has to be thought of when a child presents with unexplained neurological symptoms.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022fe","authors":["Gaudichon J","Sakr W","Becher S","Linard M","Kozisek S"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.arcped.2013.03.025","endpage":"649","first_seen_on":"2013-05-01T17:22:57+00:00","issns":["1769-664X","0929-693X","0929693X"],"issue":"6","journal":"Archives de Pediatrie","last_mentioned_on":1478837453,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23628118","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23628118"],"pmid":"23628118","pubdate":"2013-04-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"646","subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"[Acute transverse myelitis and Lyme borreliosis: A case report.]","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mylite-transverse-aigu-et-maladie-lyme-propos-dun-cas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7679268,"mean":6.5932591477757,"rank":3753827,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3729642,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7679268,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118054,"mean":6.7612381049191,"rank":52232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":62192,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118054,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":486,"mean":1.5215422680412,"rank":132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":338,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":486,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.1633333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Worldwide Lyme Protest- Spain","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=255375311274124&id=182915508520105","license":"public","citation_ids":[1425265],"posted_on":"2013-05-01T20:55:16+00:00","summary":"Neuroborreliosis manifests itself most often with peripheral facial palsy, but there are other clinical forms, which include acute myelitis (4-5% of neuroborreliosis).
