The subfornical organ (SFO) is a circumventricular organ with identified roles in body fluid homeostasis, cardiovascular control and energy balance. The SFO lacks a normal blood-brain barrier, and is thus able to detect circulating signalling molecules such as angiotensin II and leptin. In this study, we investigated actions of apelin-13, the predominant apelin isoform in brain and circulatory system, on the excitability of dissociated SFO neurons using electrophysiological approaches, and determined the cardiovascular consequences of direct administration into the SFO of anaesthetized rats. Whole cell current clamp recording revealed that bath-applied 100 nm apelin-13 directly influences the excitability of the majority of SFO neurons by eliciting either depolarizing (31.8%, mean 7.0 \u00b1 0.8 mV) or hyperpolarizing (28.6%, mean -10.4 \u00b1 1.8 mV) responses. Using voltage-clamp techniques, we also identified modulatory actions of apelin-13 on specific ion channels, demonstrating that apelin-13 activates a non-selective cationic conductance to depolarize SFO neurons while activation of the delayed rectifier potassium conductance underlies hyperpolarizing effects. In anaesthetized rats, microinjection of apelin into SFO decreased both blood pressure (BP) (mean area under the curve -1492.3 \u00b1 357.1 mmHg.s, n = 5) and heart rate (HR) (-32.4 \u00b1 10.39 beats, n = 5). Our data suggest that circulating apelin can directly affect BP and HR as a consequence of the ability of this peptide to modulate the excitability of SFO neurons.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007df5","authors":["Dai, Li","Smith, Pauline M.","Kuksis, Markus","Ferguson, Alastair V."],"doi":"10.1113\/jphysiol.2013.254144","endpage":"3432","first_seen_on":"2013-04-30T00:43:17+00:00","funders":["cihr"],"issns":["1469-7793","0022-3751"],"issue":"13","journal":"Journal of Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1367282457,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1113\/jphysiol.2013.254144\/abstract;jsessionid=35AF04A984091B7447DE5017DD38DA50.d01t04"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1113\/jphysiol.2013.254144\/pdf","pmid":"23629509","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"3421","subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Apelin acts in the Subfornical Organ to influence neuronal excitability and cardiovascular function","type":"article","volume":"591","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/apelin-acts-subfornical-organ-influence-neuronal-excitability-cardiovascular-function"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6287087,"mean":5.981417171326,"rank":4648101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":940860,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6287087,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98620,"mean":7.226051207171,"rank":66287,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":18106,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98620,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2767,"mean":6.0200130151844,"rank":2105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":355,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2767,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":2.845,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
