At long-term follow-up, what happens to patients with complications that exceeded the initial ones (Acta Orthop Scand 60:20, 1989)? We retrospectively studied patients who were submitted to Maquet III procedure, by functional and radiologic long-term outcomes, in order to determine if this surgery has or has not fulfilled its initially proposed objectives. From 1970 to 1991, 116 patients benefit from the Maquet III procedure. From this, we were able to review in 2011, 23 patients (25 knees) who went through a single Maquet III procedure. Of these patients, 52% were males. Age at surgery was 39.7 \u00b1 11.4, with a postoperative follow-up of 27.2 \u00b1 3.1 years.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000079b","doi":"10.1186\/1749-799x-8-11","first_seen_on":"2013-05-01T00:04:39+00:00","issns":["1749-799X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Research","last_mentioned_on":1367366520,"links":["http:\/\/www.josr-online.com\/content\/8\/1\/11\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.josr-online.com\/content\/pdf\/1749-799X-8-11.pdf","pmid":"23631358","pubdate":"2013-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"11","subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Maquet III procedure: what remains after initial complications - long-term results","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/maquet-iii-procedure-remains-after-initial-complicationslongterm-results"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6228985,"mean":5.9651782765876,"rank":2926224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1858535,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6228985,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98734,"mean":7.2259166033647,"rank":48986,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":36883,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98734,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":336,"mean":2.1459223880597,"rank":160,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":80,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":336,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":2.8083333333333,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
