Lingual sensory impairment remains a clinical problem in oral and maxillofacial surgery and has serious medical and legal implications. In fact, damage to the lingual nerve is a common cause of litigation in dentistry. The purpose of this article was to review the literature about lingual nerve deficit following mandibular third molar removal and discuss the associated medicolegal aspects.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f6100083ec","authors":["Boffano P","Roccia F","Gallesio C"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.tripleo.2011.06.034","first_seen_on":"2013-04-30T10:08:49+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"3","journal":"Oral Surgery, Oral Medicine, Oral Pathology and Oral Radiology","last_mentioned_on":1367316393,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22669152?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22669152","pubdate":"2012-06-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","subjects":["dentistry","generalsurgery"],"title":"Lingual nerve deficit following mandibular third molar removal: Review of the literature and medicolegal considerations.","type":"article","volume":"113","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lingual-nerve-deficit-following-mandibular-third-molar-removal-review-literature-medicolegal-conside"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
