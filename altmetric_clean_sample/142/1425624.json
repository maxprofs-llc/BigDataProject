Cereal-based food products (n=174) were analysed for the occurrence of deoxynivalenol, 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol, 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol, zearalenone, \u03b1-zearalenol, \u03b2-zearalenol, T-2-toxin, HT-2-toxin, and their respective masked forms, including, deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside, zearalenone-4-glucoside, \u03b1-zearalenol-4-glucoside, \u03b2-zearalenol-4-glucoside and zearalenone-4-sulfate. Fibre-enriched bread, bran-enriched bread, breakfast cereals, popcorn and oatmeal were collected in Belgian supermarkets according to a structured sampling plan and analysed during the period from April 2010 to October 2011. The habitual intake of these food groups was estimated from a national representative food intake survey. According to a probabilistic exposure analysis, the mean (and P95) mycotoxin intake for the sum of the deoxynivalenol-equivalents, zearalenone-equivalents, and the sum of HT-2-and T-2-toxin for all cereal-based foods was 0.1162 (0.4047, P95), 0.0447 (0.1568, P95) and 0.0258 (0.0924, P95) \u03bcg kg(-1)body weight day(-1), respectively. These values were below the tolerable daily intake (TDI) levels for deoxynivalenol, zearalenone and the sum of T-2 and HT-2 toxin (1.0, 0.25 and 0.1 \u03bcg kg(-1)body weight day(-1), respectively). The absolute level exceeding the TDI for all cereal-based foods was calculated, and recorded 0.85%, 2.75% and 4.11% of the Belgian population, respectively.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f61000367d","authors":["De Boevre M","Jacxsens L","Lachat C","Eeckhout M","Mavungu JD","Audenaert K","Maene P","Haesaert G","Kolsteren P","De Meulenaer B","De Saeger S","Marthe De Boevre","Liesbeth Jacxsens","Carl Lachat","Mia Eeckhout","Jos\u00e9 Diana Di Mavungu","Kris Audenaert","Peter Maene","Geert Haesaert","Patrick Kolsteren","Bruno De Meulenaer","Sarah De Saeger"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.toxlet.2013.02.016","endpage":"292","first_seen_on":"2013-05-01T21:03:18+00:00","handle":"1854\/LU-3138844","handles":["1854\/LU-3138844"],"issns":["0378-4274","03784274"],"issue":"3","journal":"Toxicology Letters","last_mentioned_on":1367442049,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0378427413000854","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.toxlet.2013.02.016"],"pmid":"23454655","pubdate":"2013-03-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ireland Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Science And Management","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"281","title":"Human exposure to mycotoxins and their masked forms through cereal-based foods in Belgium ","type":"article","volume":"218","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/human-exposure-mycotoxins-masked-forms-through-cerealbased-foods-belgium"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6230817,"mean":5.9681223701699,"rank":4607958,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":935275,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6230817,"percentile":15},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98742,"mean":7.2269578189405,"rank":66400,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":18132,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98742,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":767,"mean":2.6671879895561,"rank":486,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":767,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.6,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Ph.
