This review presents evidence that mammographic density is a strong risk factor for breast cancer, and that risk of breast cancer is four to five times greater in women with density in more than 75% of the breast than in women with little or no density in the breast. Density in more than 50% of the breast could account for about a third of breast cancers. The epidemiology of mammographic density is consistent with its being a marker of susceptibility to breast cancer. Twin studies have shown that the proportion of the breast occupied by density, at a given age, is highly heritable, and inherited factors explain 63% of the variance. Mammographic breast density has the characteristics of a quantitative trait and might be determined by genes that are easier to identify than those for breast cancer itself. The genes that determine breast density might also be associated with risk of breast cancer, and their identification is also likely to provide insights into the biology of the breast and identify potential targets for preventive strategies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fd1","authors":["Boyd NF","Rommens JM","Vogt K","Lee V","Hopper JL","Yaffe MJ","Paterson AD","Norman F Boyd","Johanna M Rommens","Kelly Vogt","Vivian Lee","John L Hopper","Martin J Yaffe","Andrew D Paterson"],"doi":"10.1016\/s1470-2045(05)70390-9","endpage":"808","first_seen_on":"2013-04-30T13:09:46+00:00","issns":["1470-2045","14702045"],"issue":"10","journal":"Lancet Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1367327243,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1470204505703909"],"pmid":"16198986","pubdate":"2005-10-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"798","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Mammographic breast density as an intermediate phenotype for breast cancer ","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1470204505703909","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mammographic-breast-density-intermediate-phenotype-breast-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629240,"mean":4.9358355666342,"rank":2016332,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":938869,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629240,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84981,"mean":6.7964844433986,"rank":43834,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":25538,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84981,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2085,"mean":10.003799424184,"rank":1482,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":335,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2085,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":4.1259459459459,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":19,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
