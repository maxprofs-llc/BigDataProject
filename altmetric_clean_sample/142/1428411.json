One key mechanism by which these drugs exert their effects is by activation of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma), a member of the nuclear receptor family. Evidence supporting this mechanism of action of the TZDs will be reviewed in this article. Recent data suggests that PPAR-gamma agonists might also have therapeutic potential in the treatment of inflammatory diseases and certain cancers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036b4","authors":["Murphy, G J","Holder, J C"],"first_seen_on":"2013-05-02T22:28:33+00:00","issns":["0165-6147"],"issue":"12","journal":"Trends in Pharmacological Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1266788640,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11121836%20"],"pmid":"11121836","pubdate":"2000-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"PPAR-gamma agonists: therapeutic role in diabetes, inflammation and cancer.","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ppar%CE%B3-agonists-therapeutic-role-diabetes-inflammation-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.08,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685758,"mean":4.9469155541215,"rank":503465,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":3181756,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685758,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85555,"mean":6.7948701171189,"rank":14533,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":71020,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85555,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":569,"mean":3.2348838028169,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":510,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":569,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":4.8171428571429,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
