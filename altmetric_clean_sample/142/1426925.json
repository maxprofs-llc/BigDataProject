This paper describes how we implemented a service-based infrastructure into the CARMEN Virtual Laboratory. A Software as a Service framework was developed to allow generic new and legacy code to be deployed as services on a heterogeneous execution framework. Users can submit analysis code typically written in Matlab, Python, C\/C++ and R as non-interactive standalone command-line applications and wrap them as services in a form suitable for deployment on the platform. The CARMEN Service Builder tool enables neuroscientists to quickly wrap their analysis software for deployment to the CARMEN platform, as a service without knowledge of the service framework or the CARMEN system. A metadata schema describes each service in terms of both system and user requirements. The search functionality allows services to be quickly discovered from the many services available. Within the platform, services may be combined into more complicated analyses using the workflow tool. CARMEN and the service infrastructure are targeted towards the neuroscience community; however, it is a generic platform, and can be targeted towards any discipline.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032f1","authors":["Michael Weeks","Mark Jessop","Martyn Fletcher","Victoria Hodge","Tom Jackson","Jim Austin"],"doi":"10.1098\/rsta.2012.0080","first_seen_on":"2013-05-02T11:50:27+00:00","funders":["bbsrc"],"issns":["1471-2962"],"journal":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical & Engineering Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1367495280,"links":["http:\/\/rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org\/content\/371\/1983\/20120080.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org\/content\/371\/1983\/20120080.full.pdf","pmid":"23230159","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Mathematics"],"subjects":["biophysics","biomedicalengineering","statisticsastopic"],"title":"The CARMEN software as a service infrastructure","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/carmen-software-service-infrastructure"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630293,"mean":4.9302727339889,"rank":2015650,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":941799,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630293,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85249,"mean":6.7971862565692,"rank":43977,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":25656,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85249,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":585,"mean":7.3722739726027,"rank":393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":112,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":585,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":2.5,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
