The objective of our study was to evaluate the association of these genes in relation to the age at disease onset (AAO) and to the clinical response upon IFN beta treatment in Spanish MS patients. We carried out a candidate gene study of TRAIL, TRAILR-1, TRAILR-2, TRAILR-3 and TRAILR-4 genes. A total of 54 SNPs were analysed in 509 MS patients under IFN beta treatment, and an additional cohort of 226 MS patients was used to validate the results. Associations of rs1047275 in TRAILR-2 and rs7011559 in TRAILR-4 genes with AAO under an additive model did not withstand Bonferroni correction. In contrast, patients with the TRAILR-1 rs20576-CC genotype showed a better clinical response to IFN beta therapy compared with patients carrying the A-allele (recessive model: p\u200a=\u200a8.88\u00d710(-4), pc\u200a=\u200a0.048, OR\u200a=\u200a0.30). This SNP resulted in a non synonymous substitution of Glutamic acid to Alanine in position 228 (E228A), a change previously associated with susceptibility to different cancer types and risk of metastases, suggesting a lack of functionality of TRAILR-1. In order to unravel how this amino acid change in TRAILR-1 would affect to death signal, we performed a molecular modelling with both alleles. Neither TRAIL binding sites in the receptor nor the expression levels of TRAILR-1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cell subsets (monocytes, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells) were modified, suggesting that this SNP may be altering the death signal by some other mechanism. These findings show a role for TRAILR-1 gene variations in the clinical outcome of IFN beta therapy that might have relevance as a biomarker to predict the response to IFN beta in MS.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Carlos L\u00f3pez-G\u00f3mez","Almudena Pino-\u00c1ngeles","Teresa \u00d3rpez-Zafra","Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Pinto-Medel","Bego\u00f1a Oliver-Martos","Jes\u00fas Ortega-Pinazo","Carlos Arn\u00e1iz","Cristina Guijarro-Castro","Jezabel Varad\u00e9","Roberto \u00c1lvarez-Lafuente","Elena Urcelay","Francisca S\u00e1nchez-Jim\u00e9nez","\u00d3scar Fern\u00e1ndez","Laura Leyva","L\u00f3pez-G\u00f3mez C","Pino-\u00c1ngeles A","Orpez-Zafra T","Pinto-Medel MJ","Oliver-Martos B","Ortega-Pinazo J","Arn\u00e1iz C","Guijarro-Castro C","Varad\u00e9 J","Alvarez-Lafuente R","Urcelay E","S\u00e1nchez-Jim\u00e9nez F","Fern\u00e1ndez O","Leyva L","Pablo Villoslada"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0062540","first_seen_on":"2013-04-29T21:30:33+00:00","issns":["1932-6203",""],"issue":"4","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1367329821,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0062540"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0062540.pdf","pmid":"23658636","pubdate":"2013-04-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e62540","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Candidate Gene Study of TRAIL and TRAIL Receptors: Association with Response to Interferon Beta Therapy in Multiple Sclerosis Patients","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0062540","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/candidate-gene-study-trail-trail-receptors-association-response-interferon-beta-therapy-multiple-scl"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992937,"mean":6.7399601605663,"rank":5772229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1935455,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992937,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118464,"mean":6.8320182335414,"rank":71761,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":41199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118464,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112181,"mean":10.352625797825,"rank":76030,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":30506,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112181,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4173,"mean":9.1176658676894,"rank":2706,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1243,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4173,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
