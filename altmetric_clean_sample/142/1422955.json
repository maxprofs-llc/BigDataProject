The VHS-RNase released into cells during infection targets differentially four classes of mRNAs. Thus, (a) VHS-RNase degrades stable cellular mRNAs and \u03b1 (immediate early) viral mRNAs; (b) it stabilizes host stress response mRNAs after deadenylation and subsequent cleavage near the adenylate-uridylate (AU)-rich elements; (c) it does not effectively degrade viral \u03b2 or \u03b3 mRNAs; and (d) it selectively spares from degradation a small number of cellular mRNAs. Current evidence suggests that several viral and at least one host protein (tristetraprolin) regulate its activity. Thus, virion protein (VP) 16 and VP22 neutralize the RNase activity at late times after infection. By binding to AU-rich elements via its interaction with tristetraprolin, the RNase deadenylates and cleaves the mRNAs in proximity to the AU-rich elements. In this report we show that another virion protein, UL47, brought into the cell during infection, attenuates the VHS-RNase activity with respect to stable host and viral \u03b1 mRNAs and effectively blocks the degradation of \u03b2 and \u03b3 mRNAs, but it has no effect on the processing of AU-rich mRNAs. The properties of UL47 suggest that it, along with the \u03b1 protein infected cell protein 27, attenuates degradation of mRNAs by the VHS-RNase through interaction with the enzyme in polyribosomes. Mutants lacking both VHS-RNase and UL47 overexpress \u03b1 genes and delay the expression of \u03b2 and \u03b3 genes, suggesting that overexpression of \u03b1 genes inhibits the downstream expression of early and late genes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Minfeng Shu","Brunella Taddeo","Weiran Zhang","Bernard Roizman","Shu M","Taddeo B","Zhang W","Roizman B"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.1305475110","endpage":"E1675","first_seen_on":"2013-04-30T18:24:17+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1091-6490","0027-8424"],"issue":"18","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1367702984,"links":["http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/110\/18\/E1669.short?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/110\/18\/E1669.full.pdf","pmid":"23589852","pubdate":"2013-04-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"E1669","subjects":["science"],"title":"Selective degradation of mRNAs by the HSV host shutoff RNase is regulated by the UL47 tegument protein","type":"article","volume":"110","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/selective-degradation-mrnas-hsv-host-shutoff-rnase-regulated-ul47-tegument-protein"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628118,"mean":4.9440792284301,"rank":1809932,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1641598,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628118,"percentile":45},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84950,"mean":6.8155573344007,"rank":37689,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":42133,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84950,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33578,"mean":13.654678678858,"rank":22250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":10455,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33578,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":939,"mean":23.060837953092,"rank":660,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":939,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
