Isoeugenol (IEG) has been tested for toxicity and carcinogenicity due to high potential for human exposure and the structural resemblance to known carcinogenic allylbenzenes. In order to support the interpretation of toxicity and carcinogenecity study outcomes, a toxicokinetic study was performed in which both sexes of F344 rats and B6C3F1 mice were given IEG as a single intravenous (IV) or gavage administration. 2. Following IV administration, IEG was rapidly eliminated from systemic circulation in both species and sexes. Gavage administration revealed a rapid absorption of IEG with tmax values \u226420 min for both species and sexes. In rats, AUC increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner and Clapp values decreased with increasing dose in both sexes suggesting saturation of IEG metabolism. On the other hand, Clapp values in male mice increased with increasing dose suggesting induction of IEG metabolism although this was not evident in the females. 3. Absolute bioavailability was greater in female rats (19%) than male rats (10%) (p < 0.0001), but was not different between the sexes for mice (28% males; 31% females) (p = 0.2437). The collective toxicokinetic data supported that low bioavailability following administration of IEG was the result of extensive first-pass metabolism.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53c3cf058f610004732","authors":["S.
