This review summarizes the advance in the regulation of ghrelin expression and secretion. We introduce the structure of ghrelin promoter, the processing and modification of ghrelin precursor, and the regulation mechanism in these processes. Then we discuss factors found to be important in the regulation of ghrelin production, including nutrients, hormones, and autonomic nervous system. Finally, we outline the alteration in the level of ghrelin in certain physiological and pathological status.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006826","authors":["X. Yin","Y. Li","G. Xu","W.
