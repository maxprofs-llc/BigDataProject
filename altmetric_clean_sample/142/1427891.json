Sugar and absolute configuration analyses gave the following CPS composition: D-Gal, 3; D-Glc, 1; D-GlcNAc, 1; D-Neu5Ac, 1. The Sambucus nigra lectin, which recognizes the Neu5Ac(\u03b12-6)Gal\/GalNAc sequence, showed binding to the native CPS. Sialic acid was found to be terminal, and the CPS was quantitatively desialylated by mild acid hydrolysis. It was also submitted to periodate oxidation followed by borohydride reduction and Smith degradation. Sugar and methylation analyses, (1)H and (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectrometry of the native CPS or of its specifically modified products allowed to determine the repeating unit sequence: [6)[Neu5Ac(\u03b12-6)Gal(\u03b21-4)GlcNAc(\u03b21-3)]Gal(\u03b21-3)Gal(\u03b21-4)Glc(\u03b21-](n). S. suis serotype 14 CPS has an identical sialic acid-containing side chain as serotype 2 CPS, but differs by the absence of rhamnose in its composition. The same side chain is also present in group B Streptococcus type Ia CPS, except that in the latter sialic acid is 2,3- rather than 2,6-linked to the following galactose. A correlation between the S. suis CPS sequence and genes of the serotype 14 cps locus encoding putative glycosyltransferases and polymerase responsible for the biosynthesis of the repeating unit is proposed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000d18","authors":["Marie-Rose Van Calsteren","Fleur Gagnon","Cynthia Calzas","Guillaume Goyette-Desjardins","Masatoshi Okura","Daisuke Takamatsu","Marcelo Gottschalk","Mariela Segura"],"doi":"10.1139\/bcb-2012-0036","endpage":"58","first_seen_on":"2013-05-02T19:16:29+00:00","issns":["0829-8211","1208-6002"],"journal":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1360829798,"links":["http:\/\/www.nrcresearchpress.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1139\/bcb-2012-0036?ai=ss&mi=3ge3i4&af=R"],"pmid":"23527632","pubdate":"2013-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"49","title":"Structure determination of\n              \n              serotype 14 capsular polysaccharide","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structure-determination-streptococcus-suis-serotype-14-capsular-polysaccharide"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629910,"mean":4.9315517540573,"rank":2900079,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":78875,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629910,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85238,"mean":6.7985959853117,"rank":66239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":345,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85238,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":265,"mean":1.7747575757576,"rank":161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":265,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.445,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Post Doc":1,"Student (Master)":1},"by_discipline":{"Biological Sciences":2}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Structure determination of Streptococcus suis serotype 14 capsular polysaccharide","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=448011718602043&id=210770368992847","license":"public","citation_ids":[1427891],"posted_on":"2013-02-14T08:16:38+00:00","summary":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Volume 0, Issue 0, Page 1-10, e-First articles.","author":{"name":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/210770368992847","facebook_wall_name":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/210770368992847\/picture","id_on_source":"210770368992847"}}]}}
