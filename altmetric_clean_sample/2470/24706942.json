Herein we present the results from a set of experiments designed to elucidate the preliminary biocompatibility of two types of ELRs that are able to form extracellular matrix-like hydrogels through either physical or chemical crosslinking, both of which are intended for different applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TERM). Initially we present in vitro cytocompatibility results obtained upon culturing HUVECs on ELR substrates, showing optimal proliferation up to 9 days. Regarding in vivo cytocompatibility, luciferase-expressing hMSCs were viable for at least 4 weeks in terms of bioluminescence emission when embedded in ELR hydrogels and injected subcutaneously into immunosuppressed mice. Furthermore, both types of ELR-based hydrogels were injected subcutaneously in immunocompetent mice and serum TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10 concentrations were measured by ELISA, confirming the lack of inflammatory response, as also observed upon macroscopic and histological evaluation. All these findings suggest that both types of ELRs possess broad biocompatibility, thus making them very promising for TERM-related applications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007eff","authors":["Arturo Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez-Fonseca","Teresa L.
