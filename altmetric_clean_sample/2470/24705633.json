In the present study, the design, synthesis, qualitative and quantitative performance of non-derivative ionic liquid matrices (ILMs) were reported. DHB\/N-methylaniline (N-MA) and DHB\/N-ethylaniline (N-EA), performing best for carbohydrate detection, have been screened out. The limit of detection for oligosaccharide provided by DHB\/N-MA and DHB\/N-EA were as low as 10\u00a0fmol. DHB\/N-MA and DHB\/N-EA showed significantly higher ion generation efficiency than DHB. The comparison of capacity to probe polysaccharide between these two ILMs and DHB also revealed their powerful potential. Their outstanding performance were probably due to lower proton affinities and stronger UV absorption at \u03bb\u00a0=\u00a0355\u00a0nm. What is more, taking DHB\/N-MA as an example, quantitative analysis of fructo-oligosaccharide mixtures extracted and identified from rice noodles has been accomplished sensitively using an internal standard method. Overall, DHB\/N-MA and DHB\/N-EA exhibited excellent performance and might be significant sources as the carbohydrate matrices.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002249","authors":["Xiaoyong Zhao","Shanshan Shen","Datong Wu","Pengfei Cai","Yuanjiang Pan"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.aca.2017.07.027","first_seen_on":"2017-09-03T10:31:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["00032670","1873-4324"],"journal":"Analytica Chimica Acta","last_mentioned_on":1504472907,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28864181?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0003267017308310&_version=1&md5=2fa2423329426c14dfa22b9bd3e799d6"],"pmid":"28864181","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Novel ionic liquid matrices for qualitative and quantitative detection of carbohydrates by matrix assisted laser desorption\/ionization mass spectrometry","type":"article","volume":"985","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-ionic-liquid-matrices-qualitative-quantitative-detection-carbohydrates-matrix-assisted-laser-d"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0.75,"1m":0.75,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8355417,"mean":7.0462862311029,"rank":6041385,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2015299,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8355417,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116400,"mean":12.06927935807,"rank":74383,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":35152,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116400,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1850,"mean":2.1509085992428,"rank":1070,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":703,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1850,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":1.2968085106383,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
