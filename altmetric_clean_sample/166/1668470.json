Several studies found higher rates of iron deficiency in obese than in normal-weight children. Hepcidin represents the main inhibitor of intestinal iron absorption, and its expression is increased in adipose tissue of obese patients. Leptin is able, in vitro, to raise hepcidin expression.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be1","authors":["Emanuele Miraglia del Giudice"],"doi":"10.1210\/jc.2009-1361","first_seen_on":"2013-08-04T18:06:50+00:00","issns":["0021-972X","1945-7197"],"issue":"12","journal":"The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1375639783,"links":["http:\/\/m.jcem.endojournals.org\/content\/94\/12\/5102.short"],"pmid":"19850683","pubdate":"2009-01-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","endocrinology"],"title":"Hepcidin in Obese Children as a Potential Mediator of the Association between Obesity and Iron Deficiency","type":"article","volume":"94","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hepcidin-obese-children-potential-mediator-association-between-obesity-iron-deficiency"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629728,"mean":4.9326084606411,"rank":2015836,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":940530,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629728,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85528,"mean":7.4449021478599,"rank":44382,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":23178,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85528,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4637,"mean":4.8777890422778,"rank":2690,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1156,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4637,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.854347826087,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
