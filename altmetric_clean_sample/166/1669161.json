The aim was to apply the principles of neuromuscular training, which have been successfully used in younger and middle-aged patients with knee injuries, to older patients with severe hip or knee OA. We hypothesized that the training program was feasible, determined as: 1) at most acceptable self-reported pain following training; 2) decreased or unchanged pain during the training period; 3) few joint specific adverse events related to training, and 4) achieved progression of training level during the training period.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007ca","authors":["Eva Ageberg","Anne Link","Ewa M Roos"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2474-11-126","first_seen_on":"2013-08-05T06:24:39+00:00","issns":["1471-2474"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1505135125,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2474-11-126.pdf","https:\/\/bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2474-11-126"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2474-11-126.pdf","pmcid":"PMC2896351","pmid":"20565735","pubdate":"2010-06-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Orthopedics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Rehabilitation","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Rheumatology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Sports Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"126","subjects":["orthopedics","physiology"],"title":"Feasibility of neuromuscular training in patients with severe hip or knee OA: The individualized goal-based NEMEX-TJR training program","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/feasibility-neuromuscular-training-patients-severe-hip-knee-oa-individualized-goalbased-nemextjr-tra"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":1.5,"1m":1.5,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8397236,"mean":7.0723276090205,"rank":3867528,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4445631,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8397236,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":129190,"mean":7.0914284188284,"rank":48865,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":78730,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":129190,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2116,"mean":5.0183791962175,"rank":1021,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":1037,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2116,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":4.2465306122449,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
