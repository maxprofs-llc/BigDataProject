In the elderly population, rapid recognition is particularly important, because the patient may have delayed seeking medical care and may have uncommon illnesses complicating the ultimate course. The causes of an acute abdomen in this population are similar to those found in younger patients with some differences in frequency. In each case, a sense of urgency to make the proper diagnosis and then institute appropriate therapy is critical.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005815","authors":["Kauvar, D R"],"first_seen_on":"2013-08-01T12:52:29+00:00","issns":["0749-0690"],"issue":"3","journal":"Clinics in geriatric medicine","last_mentioned_on":1375351200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8374856"],"pmid":"8374856","pubdate":"1993-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"The geriatric acute abdomen.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/geriatric-acute-abdomen"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685110,"mean":4.9302723403875,"rank":614140,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":3055306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685110,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85770,"mean":7.3868242138768,"rank":17191,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":68288,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85770,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94,"mean":2.1623655913978,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":82,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"A time-based approach to elderly patients with altered mental status","url":"http:\/\/academiclifeinem.com\/a-time-based-approach-to-elderly-patients-with-altered-mental-status\/","citation_ids":[1322814,1662168,1662169,1662171,1662173,1662174,1662175,1242919,1662176,1662177,1662178,1662179],"posted_on":"2013-08-01T10:00:00+00:00","summary":"It\u2019s 7 am on a Monday.
