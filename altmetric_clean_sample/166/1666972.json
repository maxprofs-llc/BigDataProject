Exercise training studies have demonstrated improvements in V\u02d9O2peak among patients with T2D, yet there is a large amount of variability in this response. Recent evidence suggests that cardiac autonomic modulation may be an important factor when considering improvements in aerobic capacity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5033cf058f61000309f","doi":"10.1249\/mss.0b013e3182a66411","first_seen_on":"2013-08-03T05:12:56+00:00","issns":["0195-9131"],"issue":"","journal":"Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise","last_mentioned_on":1375506730,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/acsm-msse\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Cardiovagal_Modulation_and_Efficacy_of_Aerobic.98271.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/acsm-msse\/9000\/00000\/Cardiovagal_Modulation_and_Efficacy_of_Aerobic.98271.pdf","pmid":"23899888","pubdate":"2013-07-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"","subjects":["sportsmedicine"],"title":"Cardiovagal Modulation and Efficacy of Aerobic Exercise Training in Obese Individuals","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cardiovagal-modulation-efficacy-aerobic-exercise-training-obese-individuals"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3074775,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":952647,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90291,"mean":7.61077594418,"rank":62027,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":17943,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90291,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2607,"mean":13.043300844206,"rank":2238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":197,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2607,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":30.199452054795,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
