Dogs are the main reservoirs in the domestic transmission cycle. The limited accuracy of diagnostic tests for canine leishmaniasis may contribute to the lack of impact of control measures recommended by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. The objective of this study was to estimate the accuracy of two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays employing L. major or L. infantum antigens and their reliability between three laboratories of different levels of complexity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Mauro Maciel de Arruda","Fabiano Borges Figueiredo","Fernanda Alvarenga Cardoso","Roberto Mitsuyoshi Hiamamoto","J\u00falia Cristina Macksoud Brazuna","Maria Regina Fernandes de Oliveira","Elza Ferreira Noronha","Gustavo Adolfo Sierra Romero"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0069988","first_seen_on":"2013-08-01T14:48:08+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"7","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1375358149,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0069988"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0069988.pdf","pmid":"23922884","pubdate":"2013-07-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e69988","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Validity and Reliability of Enzyme Immunoassays Using Leishmania major or L. infantum Antigens for the Diagnosis of Canine Visceral Leishmaniasis in Brazil","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/validity-reliability-enzyme-immunoassays-using-leishmania-major-l-infantum-antigens-diagnosis-canine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6228993,"mean":5.9654070340771,"rank":5293723,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6228993,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100358,"mean":7.7491556343853,"rank":83238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100358,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98168,"mean":9.7594020801288,"rank":82457,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98168,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3723,"mean":13.018636754433,"rank":3075,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3723,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
