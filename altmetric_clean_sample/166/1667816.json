Specialized proteins recognize DNA inducing and stabilizing sharp curvatures of the double helix. However, experimental evidence suggests a high protein-independent flexibility of DNA. On the basis of coarse-grained simulations, we propose that DNA experiences thermally induced kinks associated with the spontaneous formation of internal bubbles. Comparison of the protein-induced DNA curvature calculated from the Protein Data Bank with that sampled by our simulations suggests that thermally induced distortions can account for ~80% of the DNA curvature present in experimentally solved structures.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008518","authors":["Zeida A","Machado MR","Dans PD","Pantano S"],"first_seen_on":"2013-08-03T21:38:01+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"2-1","journal":"Physical Review E: Statistical, Nonlinear, and Soft Matter Physics","last_mentioned_on":1375565848,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/23005781\/"],"pmid":"23005781","pubdate":"2012-09-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Mathematics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biophysics","physiology","statisticsastopic"],"title":"Breathing, bubbling, and bending: DNA flexibility from multimicrosecond simulations.","type":"article","volume":"86","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/breathing-bubbling-bending-dna-flexibility-multimicrosecond-simulations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3070038,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":946646,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90293,"mean":7.6139848713066,"rank":61293,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":17585,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90293,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5151,"mean":1.6954955339806,"rank":2445,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1568,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5151,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":3.9554545454545,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
