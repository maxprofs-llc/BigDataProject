Quantification of the analytes was carried out by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in negative chemical ionisation mode (GC-NCI-MS\/MS). The limit of detection and limit of quantification of residues were in the range of 0.01-1ng\/g and 0.05-2ng\/g, respectively. The analytes showed recoveries between 62% and 110%, and the matrix effect was observed to be less than 25% for most of the pesticides. Crude edible oil samples showed endosulfan isomers, p,p'-DDD, \u03b1-cypermethrin, chlorpyrifos, and diazinon residues in the range of 0.56-2.14ng\/g. However, no pesticide residues in the detection range of the method were observed in refined oils.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028f5","authors":["Pragney Deme","Tirupathi Azmeera","B.L.A.
