Using mouse models deleted electively for ER\u03b1AF-1 (ER\u03b1AF-1\u00b0) or ER\u03b1AF-2 (ER\u03b1AF-2\u00b0), we determined their respective roles in the actions of estrogens on body composition and glucose homeostasis in response to either a normal diet or a high-fat diet (HFD). ER\u03b1AF-2\u00b0 males and females developed accelerated weight gain, massive adiposity, severe insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance--quite reminiscent of the phenotype observed in mice deleted for the entire ER\u03b1 protein (ER\u03b1(-\/-)). In striking contrast, ER\u03b1AF-1\u00b0 and wild-type (wt) mice shared a similar metabolic phenotype. Accordingly, 17\u03b2-estradiol administration regulated key metabolic genes in insulin-sensitive tissues and conferred a strong protection against HFD-induced metabolic disturbances in wt and ER\u03b1AF-1\u00b0 ovariectomized mice, whereas these actions were totally abrogated in ER\u03b1AF-2\u00b0 and ER\u03b1(-\/-) mice. Thus, whereas both AFs have been previously shown to contribute to endometrial and breast cancer cell proliferation, the protective effect of estrogens against obesity and insulin resistance depends on ER\u03b1AF-2 but not ER\u03b1AF-1, thereby delineating new options for selective modulation of ER\u03b1.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026f7","authors":["Sandra Handgraaf","Elodie Riant","Aur\u00e9lie Fabre","Aur\u00e9lie Waget","R\u00e9my Burcelin","Philippe Li\u00e8re","Andr\u00e9e Krust","Pierre Chambon","Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Arnal","Pierre Gourdy"],"doi":"10.2337\/db13-0282","first_seen_on":"2013-08-05T14:39:54+00:00","issns":["1939-327X"],"issue":"12","journal":"Diabetes","last_mentioned_on":1428337330,"links":["http:\/\/diabetes.diabetesjournals.org\/lookup\/doi\/10.2337\/db13-0282","http:\/\/diabetes.diabetesjournals.org\/content\/62\/12\/4098.short?rss=1","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3837069\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/diabetes.diabetesjournals.org\/content\/early\/2013\/07\/29\/db13-0282.full.pdf","pmid":"23903353","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Prevention of Obesity and Insulin Resistance by Estrogens Requires ER\u03b1 Activation Function-2 (ER\u03b1AF-2), Whereas ER\u03b1AF-1 Is Dispensable","type":"article","volume":"62","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevention-obesity-insulin-resistance-estrogens-requires-era-activation-function2-eraaf2-whereas-era"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5128632,"mean":6.0682737627271,"rank":2530699,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2444206,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5128632,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95906,"mean":7.7167203795423,"rank":43668,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":49248,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95906,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3344,"mean":6.0510224349387,"rank":2040,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1186,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3344,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":5.2152857142857,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
