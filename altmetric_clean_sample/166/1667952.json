As follow-up to that conference, MITA convened a second conference of stakeholders to advise payers on what might be acceptable endpoints for clinical trials to support the coverage of novel PET agents. The conference involved experts on imaging and clinical research, providers of PET services, as well as representatives of interested medical societies, the PET industry, and the regulatory and payer communities. The principal outcome of their deliberations was that it was unrealistic to expect trials of new PET radiopharmaceuticals to directly demonstrate a health benefit. Rather, intermediate outcomes, such as a positive change in patient management, would be more efficient and appropriate.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007da6","doi":"10.2967\/jnumed.113.127886","first_seen_on":"2013-08-04T01:25:32+00:00","issns":["1535-5667"],"journal":"Journal of Nuclear Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1375579517,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23907756?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23907756","pubdate":"2013-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"The Medical Imaging & Technology Alliance Conference on Research Endpoints Appropriate for Medicare Coverage of New PET Radiopharmaceuticals.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/medical-imaging-technology-alliance-conference-research-endpoints-appropriate-medicare-coverage-new"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627649,"mean":4.9475528391989,"rank":2905867,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":74454,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627649,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85440,"mean":7.4642389775162,"rank":68079,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":215,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85440,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1266,"mean":2.3843367588933,"rank":771,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1266,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":1.9440677966102,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
