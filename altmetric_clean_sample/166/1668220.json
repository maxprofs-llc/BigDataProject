This has been demonstrated in some studies, while others have not been able to replicate the findings. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relation between the different ADH1C genotypes, death from coronary heart disease (CHD) and alcohol in a material larger than the previously published studies. Eight hundred CHD deaths as well as 1303 controls were genotyped for the high V(max) (\u03b31) and the low V(max) (\u03b32) ADH1C variant. Information of alcohol use was available for all subjects. Multiple logistic regression analyses was used to study if the decreased risk of death from CHD in alcohol consuming subjects was more pronounced in subjects homozygous for the \u03b32 allele (\u03b32\u03b32 subjects) compared to \u03b31\u03b31 and \u03b31\u03b32 subjects. The odds ratio (OR) for death from CHD in alcohol consumers compared to abstainers was similar in the genotype groups, i.e., 0.62 (95% CI: 0.43-0.88) in \u03b31\u03b31 subjects and 0.62 (95% CI: 0.42-0.91) in \u03b32\u03b32 subjects. Also when stratifying the results by gender and when dividing alcohol consumers into different alcohol consumption groups, there was no difference in the OR between the different genotype groups. This study, which included the largest study group published so far, failed to find any link between the ADH1C genotype and the cardioprotective effects of alcohol.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021c5","authors":["H\u00f8iseth G","Magnus P","Knudsen GP","Jansen MD","N\u00e6ss O","Tambs K","M\u00f8rland J"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.alcohol.2012.12.005","first_seen_on":"2013-08-04T10:51:13+00:00","issns":["0741-8329"],"issue":"","journal":"Alcohol","last_mentioned_on":1375613462,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23321361?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23321361","pubdate":"2013-01-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Social Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"Is ADH1C genotype relevant for the cardioprotective effect of alcohol?","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adh1c-genotype-relevant-cardioprotective-effect-alcohol"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3617832,"mean":4.9276880009076,"rank":2015528,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":925351,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3617832,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85251,"mean":7.4853517888564,"rank":44388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":22834,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85251,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":223,"mean":7.9229279279279,"rank":133,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":223,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":61.212333333333,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
