Single and half-sarcomeres were isolated from myofibrils using micro-needles, which were also used for force measurements. After full force development, both preparations were stretched by different magnitudes. The sarcomere length (SL) or half-sarcomere length variations (HSL) were extracted by measuring the initial and final distances from the Z-line to the adjacent Z-line or to a region externally adjacent to the M-line of the sarcomere, respectively. Half-sarcomeres generated approximately the same amount of isometric force (29.0 \u00b1 SD 15.5\u2005nN\u00b7\u03bcm(-2)) as single sarcomeres (32.1 \u00b1 SD 15.3\u2005nN\u00b7\u03bcm(-2)) when activated. In both cases, the steady-state forces after stretch were higher than the forces during isometric contractions at similar conditions. The results suggest that stretch-induced force enhancement is partly caused by proteins within the half-sarcomere.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["F\u00c3\u00a1bio C.
