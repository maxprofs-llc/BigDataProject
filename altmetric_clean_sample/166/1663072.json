Radical resection techniques are still the golden standard in the management of rectal cancer, but the increased postoperative morbidity and mortality led to the idea that less traumatizing procedures of local excision may have the same oncologic results, in selected cases. Yet, the significantly higher local recurrence rate after local excision in comparison to radical resection has been certified by most studies; that points out the need of clearly defined guidelines for local excision. In the present review the following aspects were taken into consideration, when considering local surgical excision as a radical procedure for rectal cancer: the clinico-pathological features of the tumours, the various types of surgical techniques used in local excision, the need for an adjuvant or neoadjuvant oncological treatment, the variety of results obtained in a large number of studies, making this particular issue a topic that is currently subject to debate.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006ea3","authors":["Mirea C","Vilcea I","Vasile I","Mita A"],"first_seen_on":"2013-08-01T16:08:39+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"1","journal":"Chirurgia","last_mentioned_on":1375351322,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23464763?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"23464763","pubdate":"2013-03-09T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Local surgical treatment with curative intent in rectal cancer.","type":"article","volume":"108","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/local-surgical-treatment-curative-intent-rectal-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6228993,"mean":5.9654070340771,"rank":5293626,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6228993,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100359,"mean":7.7488676737281,"rank":83226,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100359,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161,"mean":0.546875,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.3125,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/status\/362875862837755904","license":"public","citation_ids":[1663072],"posted_on":"2013-08-01T10:02:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":441},"tweet_id":"362875862837755904"}]}}
