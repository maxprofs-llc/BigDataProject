The interaction between LecA and aromatic \u03b2-galactoside biofilm inhibitors involves an intermolecular CH-\u03c0 T-shape interaction between C(\u03b51)-H of residue His50 in LecA and the aromatic ring of the galactoside aglycone. The generality of this interaction was tested in a diverse family of \u03b2-galactosides. LecA binding to aromatic \u03b2-galactosides (KD \u223c 8 \u03bcM) was consistently stronger than to aliphatic \u03b2-galactosides (KD \u223c 36 \u03bcM). The CH-\u03c0 interaction was observed in the X-ray crystal structures of six different LecA complexes, with shorter than the van der Waals distances indicating productive binding. Related XH\/cation\/\u03c0-\u03c0 interactions involving other residues were identified in complexes of aromatic glycosides with a variety of carbohydrate binding proteins such as concanavalin A. Exploiting such interactions might be generally useful in drug design against these targets.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006811","authors":["Rameshwar U.
