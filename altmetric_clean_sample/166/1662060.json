Components of calcineurin pathway are involved in myocardium hypertrophy regulation, angiogenesis and apoptosis. Results of quantitative expression profiling study of main calcineurin pathway genes PPP3CA, PPP3R1, PPP3CB, GATA4 and NFATC4 in myocardium of right atrium auricle of patients with a coronary heart disease, exposed to various types of surgical treatments depending on weight of a clinical finding (surgical reconstruction of the geometry of left ventricle (LV) (postinfarction aneurysm) or coronary artery bypass grafting in case of unaltered morphology of LV) are presented. In patients with sizable postinfarction LV dilatation (n = 21) expression level of calcineurin catalytic subunit genes PPP3CA and PPP3CB was 1.3 and 1.6 times lower (p = 0.018 and 0.023, accordingly) compared to patients with unaltered shape of the heart (n = 34). Expression level of PPP3R1 gene encoding calcineurin regulatory subunit B and GATA4 and NFATC4 genes for transcription factors did not differ in studied subgroups of patients. Thus, lower expression of PPP3CA and PPP3CB genes in atrium myocardium can be related to expressed postinfarction LV remodeling. Further studies of relation quantitative expression profiling of calcineurin pathway genes with the level of damage of myocardium is essential what may have important outcome for the prevention of adverse events of cardiosurgical treatments in patients with postinfarction remodeling.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9193cf058f61000d2c2","first_seen_on":"2013-08-01T01:15:08+00:00","issns":["0026-8984"],"issue":"3","journal":"Molekuliarnaia biologiia","last_mentioned_on":1375266391,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23888774?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"23888774","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"[Expression profile of calcineurin pathway genes in myocardium tissues in relation to ischemic heart remodeling in humans].","type":"article","volume":"47"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6228993,"mean":5.9654070340771,"rank":4381177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1622545,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6228993,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100359,"mean":7.7490794156919,"rank":63702,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":32649,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100359,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":181,"mean":1.3856,"rank":77,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":98,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":181,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mo000odi\/status\/362519637809823744","license":"public","rt":["cirugiaF"],"citation_ids":[1662060],"posted_on":"2013-07-31T10:26:31+00:00","author":{"name":"mo0odi","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1760874236\/image_normal.jpg","description":"\u2741 #\u062a\u063a\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0647 \u2741 \u0627\u0643\u062a\u0645\u0648\u0627 \u062d\u0633\u0646\u0627\u062a\u0643\u0645 \u0643\u0645\u0627 \u062a\u0643\u062a\u0645\u0648\u0646 \u0633\u064a\u0626\u0627\u062a\u0643\u0645. \u2741 #\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0639\u0629_\u0627\u0644\u0639\u062f\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u2741","id_on_source":"mo000odi","tweeter_id":"463858307","followers":108},"tweet_id":"362519637809823744"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/status\/362515242829348865","license":"public","citation_ids":[1662060],"posted_on":"2013-07-31T10:09:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":439},"tweet_id":"362515242829348865"}]}}
