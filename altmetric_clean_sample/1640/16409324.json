Unfortunately, hardware restrictions often limit the sensor performance. In nanoscale magnetic resonance probes, for instance, finite sampling times greatly limit the achievable sensitivity and spectral resolution. Here we introduce a technique for coherent quantum interpolation that can overcome these problems. Using a quantum sensor associated with the nitrogen vacancy center in diamond, we experimentally demonstrate that quantum interpolation can achieve spectroscopy of classical magnetic fields and individual quantum spins with orders of magnitude finer frequency resolution than conventionally possible. Not only is quantum interpolation an enabling technique to extract structural and chemical information from single biomolecules, but it can be directly applied to other quantum systems for superresolution quantum spectroscopy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Ashok Ajoy","Yi-Xiang Liu","Kasturi Saha","Luca Marseglia","Jean-Christophe Jaskula","Ulf Bissbort","Paola Cappellaro"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.1610835114","first_seen_on":"2017-02-14T21:52:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1091-6490","0027-8424"],"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1487324714,"links":["http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2017\/02\/13\/1610835114.abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/doi:10.1073\/pnas.1610835114","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.1610835114","http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2017\/02\/13\/1610835114.html"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2017\/02\/13\/1610835114.full.pdf","pmid":"28196889","pubdate":"2017-02-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"201610835","subjects":["science"],"title":"Quantum interpolation for high-resolution sensing","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quantum-interpolation-highresolution-sensing"},"altmetric_score":{"score":89.428,"score_history":{"1y":89.428,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":89.428},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8223523,"mean":6.9683458335668,"rank":94974,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":8128645,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8223523,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271389,"mean":12.939644671098,"rank":7357,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":264032,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271389,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46340,"mean":24.018398584346,"rank":2644,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":43696,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46340,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1062,"mean":51.652401508011,"rank":156,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":906,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1062,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
