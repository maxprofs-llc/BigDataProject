Increased breast cancer awareness has facilitated research to guide health care providers toward improving patient outcomes. Research in diagnostic and treatment modalities has expanded to focus on improving the quality of\u00a0life for patients with breast cancer who are living longer than expected. Providers can offer patients with nonpalpable breast lesions new screening techniques and improved treatment options, including radioactive seed localization lumpectomy. This treatment offers patients the potential for decreased tumor re-excision for positive margins near the surgical site, a lower volume of excised breast tissue, decreased operative time, convenient surgical scheduling, and less pain. Additionally, radioactive seed localization lumpectomy can improve patient and staff member satisfaction.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005730","authors":["Burroughs, Judy","Fencl, Jennifer L.","Wakefield, Matthew C.","Judy Burroughs","Jennifer L.
