The levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 [TNF-\u03b1], interleukin [IL]-1\u03b2, and IL-6) were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Protein levels of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated death promoter (Bad) and cleaved-caspase-3 were assessed by immunoblotting.\nAdministration of pellets containing 5% a\u00e7a\u00ed powder reduced the incidences of both colonic adenoma and cancer (adenoma, 23.1% vs 76.9%, respectively, p=0.006; cancer, 15.4% vs 76.9%, respectively, p=0.002). In the a\u00e7a\u00ed-treated mice, the MPO, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 levels in the colon were significantly down-regulated. A\u00e7a\u00ed inhibited PCNA and Bcl-2 expression and increased Bad and cleaved-caspase-3 expression. In vitro studies demonstrated that a\u00e7a\u00ed treatment reduced lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and COX-2 in murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells.\nA\u00e7a\u00ed demonstrated protective effects against AOM\/DSS-induced colon carcinogenesis, which suggests that the intake of a\u00e7a\u00ed may be beneficial for the prevention of human colon cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc21","authors":["Yoon Jin Choi","Yoon Jeong Choi","Nayoung Kim","Ryoung Hee Nam","Seonmin Lee","Hye Seung Lee","Ha-Na Lee","Young-Joon Surh","Dong Ho Lee"],"doi":"10.5009\/gnl16068","first_seen_on":"2017-05-31T12:09:39+00:00","issns":["1976-2283","2005-1212"],"journal":"Gut and Liver","last_mentioned_on":1503583590,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27965474"],"pmid":"27965474","pubdate":"2017-03-15T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"A\u00e7a\u00ed Berries Inhibit Colon Tumorigenesis in Azoxymethane\/Dextran Sulfate Sodium-Treated Mice","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a%C3%A7a%C3%AD-berries-inhibit-colon-tumorigenesis-azoxymethanedextran-sulfate-sodiumtreated-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.5,"score_history":{"1y":10.5,"6m":10.5,"3m":1.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8422812,"mean":7.0866213065837,"rank":826142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7589342,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8422812,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245788,"mean":12.571423452013,"rank":37872,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":207655,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245788,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186,"mean":2.5298378378378,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":174,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"BR":1}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"5 Impressive Health Benefits of Acai Berries","url":"https:\/\/authoritynutrition.com\/benefits-of-acai-berries\/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+AuthorityNutrition+%28Authority+Nutrition%29","license":"public","citation_ids":[4109115,2406263,1019162,1651408,2156133,1123861,20725059,168669,572281,2814583,20725061,2233974,20725063,2961073,20725067,5303135,4982913,5303136],"posted_on":"2017-05-31T10:00:00+00:00","summary":"Acai berries are a Brazilian &ldquo;superfruit.&rdquo; They&rsquo;re native to the Amazon region where they&rsquo;re a staple food.
