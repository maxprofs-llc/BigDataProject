However, the prognostic value of activation of the MEK\/ERK signaling pathway in newly diagnosed patients with MM has not been reported. MATERIAL AND METHODS Expression levels of p-ERK1\/2 protein in bone marrow biopsy specimens obtained from 60 newly diagnosed patients with MM were analyzed using immunohistochemistry, and classified into 3 groups: high p-ERK1\/2 expression, low p-ERK1\/2 expression, and negative group. Correlations between clinicopathological characteristics, including expression levels of p-ERK1\/2 protein, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS), were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS Phosphorylated-ERK1\/2 protein was positive in 47 bone marrow specimens, including 19 specimens with high p-ERK1\/2 expression and 28 specimens with low p-ERK1\/2 expression. Univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that in newly diagnosed patients with MM, high p-ERK1\/2 expression, high ISS staging, serum creatinine (Scr) \u2265177 \u03bcmol\/l, serum \u03b22-microglobulin (\u03b22-MG) \u22655.5 \u03bcmol\/l, and serum calcium (Ca) \u22652.75 mmol\/l were significantly associated with shorter OS and PFS. Additionally, high ECOG scores (score 2-4) were associated with shorter PFS in newly diagnosed patients with MM. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that in newly diagnosed patients with MM, high p-ERK1\/2 expression was significantly associated with shorter OS and PFS. Additionally, in newly diagnosed patients with MM, serum Ca \u22652.75 mmol\/l was significantly associated with shorter PFS, and serum \u03b22-MG \u22655.5 \u03bcmol\/l was significantly associated with shorter OS. CONCLUSIONS High p-ERK1\/2 expression is an independent factor for poor prognosis in newly diagnosed patients with MM.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9273cf058f61000dd13","authors":["Fan, Liping","Hong, Jinquan","Huang, Haobo","Fu, Danhui","Wu, Shunquan","Wang, Qingqing","Ye, Yamei","Liu, Yun"],"first_seen_on":"2017-05-31T10:14:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1643-3750"],"journal":"Medical science monitor international medical journal of experimental and clinical research","last_mentioned_on":1496225668,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28557972?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28557972","pubdate":"2017-05-31T22:01:17+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"High Expression of Phosphorylated Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase (ERK1\/2) is Associated with Poor Prognosis in Newly Diagnosed Patients with Multiple Myeloma.","type":"article","volume":"23"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8296164,"mean":6.9911317525872,"rank":7173926,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8296164,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240197,"mean":12.039263668004,"rank":195415,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240197,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1022,"mean":2.7992967678746,"rank":677,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1022,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":2.3895,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/statuses\/869859617915916288","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20721390],"posted_on":"2017-05-31T10:14:28+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
