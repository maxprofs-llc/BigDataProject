Patients were excluded with multiorgan transplant, no CR data, and follow-up less than 90 days after HTx. Demographic and exercise data at baseline before HTx were collected. Post-HTx exercise capacity, biopsy, CR data, and medications were collected at 1 through 5 and 10 years.\nOverall survival at 1, 5, and 10 years was 98%, 88%, and 82%, respectively; 29 patients died. Number of CR sessions attended in the first 90 days after HTx predicted survival in multivariate regression, controlling for baseline post-HTx 6-minute walk test (6MWT) results and rejection episodes (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82-0.97; P=.007). Additional univariate predictors of survival included pre-HTx 6MWT results, weight at HTx, and body mass index and systolic blood pressure at CR enrollment. Pre-HTx 6MWT results, body mass index, and post-HTx were associated with improvement in peak oxygen consumption.\nThis report demonstrates, for the first time, an association between CR and long-term survival in patients after HTx. Further work should clarify the most beneficial aspects of CR.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5023cf058f61000307b","authors":["Rosenbaum, Andrew N","Kremers, Walter K","Schirger, John A","Thomas, Randal J","Squires, Ray W","Allison, Thomas G","Daly, Richard C","Kushwaha, Sudhir S","Edwards, Brooks S"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.mayocp.2015.12.002","endpage":"156","first_seen_on":"2016-06-23T03:02:52+00:00","issns":["1942-5546","00256196"],"issue":"2","journal":"Mayo Clinic Proceedings","last_mentioned_on":1476169100,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26848001","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26848001"],"pmid":"26848001","pubdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"149","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Association Between Early Cardiac Rehabilitation and Long-term Survival in Cardiac Transplant Recipients","type":"article","volume":"91","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-between-early-cardiac-rehabilitation-longterm-survival-cardiac-transplant-recipients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.2,"score_history":{"1y":4.2,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7523579,"mean":6.5040957411445,"rank":1527371,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":5986346,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7523579,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257752,"mean":11.542572754325,"rank":69329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":187860,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257752,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1927,"mean":18.453883696781,"rank":694,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":1232,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1927,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":37.873803921569,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
