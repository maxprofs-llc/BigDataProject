However, its biological properties and molecular mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory activity and underlying molecular mechanism of MH ethanol extract (MHE) on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated inflammatory response in macrophages. MHE cytotoxicity was determined using a cell counting kit (CCK) assay. The effects of MHE on the production of NO, inflammatory cytokines, and related proteins and mRNAs were determined using the Griess test, ELISA, Western blotting, and real-time RT-PCR, respectively. In addition, intracellular signaling pathways, such as NF-\u03baB, MAPK, and HO-1, were analyzed using Western blotting. Our results revealed that MHE treatment significantly inhibited the secretion of NO and inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2 in macrophages, at sub-cytotoxic concentrations. Furthermore, MHE treatment inhibited iNOS expression and induced HO-1 expression. Finally, the transcriptional activities of NF-\u03baB and MAPK activation were significantly suppressed by MHE in LPS-stimulated macrophages. The results indicate that MHE exerts anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing inflammatory mediator production via NF-\u03baB and MAPK signaling pathways inhibition and induction of HO-1 expression in macrophages. Therefore, our results suggest the potential value of MHE as an inflammatory therapeutic agent developed from a natural substance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422e","authors":["Yun Jeong","Jeong, Yun Hee","Oh, You-Chang","Cho, Won-Kyung","Lee, Bohyoung","Ma, Jin Yeul"],"doi":"10.3390\/molecules21060818","first_seen_on":"2016-06-23T10:52:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1420-3049"],"issue":"6","journal":"Molecules","last_mentioned_on":1466879476,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/21\/6\/818","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27338335?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/21\/6\/818\/pdf","pmid":"27338335","pubdate":"2016-06-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Melandrii Herba Ethanol Extract via Inhibition of NF-\u03baB and MAPK Signaling Pathways and Induction of HO-1 in RAW 264.7 Cells and Mouse Primary Macrophages","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antiinflammatory-effects-melandrii-herba-ethanol-extract-via-inhibition-nfkappab-mapk-signaling-path"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.45,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7942916,"mean":6.7127945609325,"rank":3230020,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4705197,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7942916,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262367,"mean":11.569245458634,"rank":96028,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":165927,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262367,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3700,"mean":2.1174922952149,"rank":540,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":3158,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3700,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267,"mean":5.6251503759398,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":218,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CH":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Molecules_MDPI\/statuses\/745889686846054401","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8987817],"posted_on":"2016-06-23T08:02:13+00:00","author":{"name":"Molecules MDPI","url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/journal\/molecules","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/482326110546321409\/Ne8yEAh3_normal.png","description":"Molecules (ISSN 1420-3049, IF 2.861), international, peer-reviewed, open access journal, covering all aspects of organic chemistry, with fast publication","id_on_source":"Molecules_MDPI","tweeter_id":"2495680742","geo":{"lt":47.41667,"ln":7.75,"country":"CH"},"followers":696},"tweet_id":"745889686846054401"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/746649687524970496","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8987817],"posted_on":"2016-06-25T10:22:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":727},"tweet_id":"746649687524970496"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/amocanm\/statuses\/746702866530836480","license":"gnip","rt":["Molecules_MDPI"],"citation_ids":[8987817],"posted_on":"2016-06-25T13:53:31+00:00","author":{"name":"Andrei Marius","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/717583327495077888\/QKFGG3r__normal.jpg","description":"PhD. student in Medicinal Plants\/Food Analytical Chemistry, University of Hamburg, Institute of Food Chemistry","id_on_source":"amocanm","tweeter_id":"2741541463","followers":80},"tweet_id":"746702866530836480"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Sociconoclast\/statuses\/746772764770639872","license":"gnip","rt":["Molecules_MDPI"],"citation_ids":[8987817],"posted_on":"2016-06-25T18:31:16+00:00","author":{"name":"Tian","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/706816294709043200\/CJcbv2Us_normal.jpg","description":"pondering #Tech #Ideas #Possibilities","id_on_source":"Sociconoclast","tweeter_id":"4834233430","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":599},"tweet_id":"746772764770639872"}]}}
