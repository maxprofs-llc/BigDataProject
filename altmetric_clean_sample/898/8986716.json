Sensory tests in glutamate and nucleotides containing bases showed that the compounds influence the whole flavor profile of savory formulations. Both, rubemamine (9) and rubescenamine (10) at 10 - 100 ppm dose dependently positively modulated the umami taste of MSG (0.17 - 0.22 %) up to 3fold. Among the investigated amides, only rubemamine (9) and rubescenamine (10) are able to directly activate the TAS1R1-TAS1R3 umami taste receptor. Moreover, both compounds also synergistically modulated the activation of TAS1R1-TAS1R3 by MSG. Most remarkably, rubemamine (9) was able to further positively modulate the IMP-enhanced TAS1R1-TAS1R3 response to MSG ~1.8fold. Finally, also armatamide (11), zanthosinamide (13), and dioxamine (14), which lack intrinsic umami taste in vivo and direct receptor response in vitro, positively modulated receptor activation by MSG about 2fold and additionally the IMP-enhanced MSG-induced TAS1R1-TAS1R3 responses approximately by 50%. In sensory experiments, dioxamine (14) at 25 ppm in combination with 0.17 % MSG exhibited a sensory equivalent to 0.37 % MSG.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006625","authors":["Michael Backes"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jafc.5b04402","endpage":"8704","first_seen_on":"2016-06-23T08:48:07+00:00","issns":["1520-5118","0021-8561"],"issue":"39","journal":"Journal of Agricultural & Food Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1466664569,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jafc.5b04402?hootPostID=b367b091e9eeb194cd7a904377aba8e9"],"pmid":"26375852","pubdate":"2015-10-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"8694","subjects":["chemistry","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"\n              Rubemamine and Rubescenamine, Two Naturally Occurring\n              N\n              -Cinnamoyl Phenethylamines with Umami-Taste-Modulating Properties\n            ","type":"article","volume":"63","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rubemamine-rubescenamine-two-naturally-occurring-ncinnamoyl-phenethylamines-umamitastemodulating-pro"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7936934,"mean":6.7106933012983,"rank":6017856,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1066880,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7936934,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262309,"mean":11.569060425149,"rank":183750,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":42611,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262309,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5945,"mean":5.5139037685061,"rank":4310,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":934,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5945,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125,"mean":6.0799516129032,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
