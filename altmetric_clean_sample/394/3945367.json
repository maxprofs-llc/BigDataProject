In one, persecutory delusions dominated (Type 1), in another persecutory delusions were accompanied by hallucinations (Type 2), and in the third a high frequency of all the assessed hallucinatory and delusional symptoms was observed (Type 3).\nMAP is a heterogeneous syndrome with positive symptom typologies.\nThis study represents the first attempt at identifying typologies of MAP and highlights the potential utility of LCA in future large-scale studies.
