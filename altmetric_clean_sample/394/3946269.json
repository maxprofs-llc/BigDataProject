The present study was conducted to examine whether the tendency for depressed individuals to maintain negative content in WM and to experience difficulties maintaining positive content in WM is due to negative mood (in)congruency effects during a depressive episode, or whether these tendencies are evident outside of a depressive episode.\nIndividuals who had recovered from a depressive episode and never disordered controls performed emotion 0-back and 2-back tasks designed to assess biases in updating emotional content in working memory.\nSimilar to currently depressed individuals in previous studies, recovered depressed participants disengaged from happy stimuli more quickly and from sad stimuli more slowly than did their never-depressed counterparts.\nDespite the extension of a depression-specific finding to recovered depressed individuals, the present study does not test whether the identified emotion updating biases predict long-term relapse or recovery.\nThe obtained results suggest that a decreased ability to disengage from negative content and to maintain positive content in WM represents a trait-like cognitive style that impairs adaptive emotion regulation and may contribute to the recurrent nature of depression.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cbd","authors":["Levens, Sara M","Gotlib, Ian H"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jbtep.2015.03.009","first_seen_on":"2015-04-27T21:31:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-7943","00057916"],"journal":"Journal of Behavior Therapy & Experimental Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1429803085,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0005791615000403&_version=1&md5=eaefd7062d0f9c7847934feb14744ac3"],"pmid":"25889375","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences","psychiatry"],"title":"Updating emotional content in recovered depressed individuals: Evaluating deficits in emotion processing following a depressive episode ","type":"article","volume":"48","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/updating-emotional-content-recovered-depressed-individuals-evaluating-deficits-emotion-processing-fo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5030571,"mean":5.9580946481244,"rank":4205798,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5030571,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":157073,"mean":9.6321060532751,"rank":131548,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":157073,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":463,"mean":4.4237878787879,"rank":378,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":463,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":3.955,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
