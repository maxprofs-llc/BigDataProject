Suitable donor corneas were retrieved with in situ trephination technique under morgue condition (group 1, MTT) or with in situ classic SRT (group 2, SRT). The two different 'in situ' methods were compared in terms of donor corneal biological quality (endothelial cell count, ECC) and functional outcome (presence of infection and primary graft failure).\nOne hundred and fifty-two of 1179 cases were suitable for corneal donation. Two hundred and twenty-nine corneas of 152 cases were transplanted, 108 corneas were obtained with MTT and 121 corneas were obtained with SRT. Pretransplant and post-transplant ECCs were 2402.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0115.6 and 2108.3 \u00b1\u00a0108.23 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.065) in MTT, respectively, and 2512.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0130.4 and 2235.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0201.8 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.059) in SRT, respectively. The incidence of primary graft failure and infection was not statistically significantly different between two method [2.7% and 1.6% (p\u00a0=\u00a00.223), 0.9% and 0.8% (p\u00a0=\u00a00.115)].\nThe two different 'in situ' methods, MTT and SRT, were similar in terms of donor ECC, presence of infection and primary graft failure. Cornea excision performed through the technique described herein may increase the corneal donation rates as result of reduced disfigurement to donor body and offer important contributions during surgery with good anatomic adaptation of tissues.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f61000215d","authors":["Yuksel, Erdem","Yuksel, Nilay","Akata, Fikret"],"doi":"10.1111\/aos.12692","endpage":"e577","first_seen_on":"2015-04-27T17:01:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1755-3768"],"issue":"7","journal":"Acta Ophthalmologica (1755375X)","last_mentioned_on":1430153853,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/aos.12692\/abstract;jsessionid=38208877EA52D84F1C25AB131EBB6A69.f03t04"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/aos.12692\/pdf","pmid":"25913383","pubdate":"2015-04-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"e573","subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Comparison of two in situ corneal donation technique: morgue trephination or scleracorneal removal technique","type":"article","volume":"93","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-two-situ-corneal-donation-technique-morgue-trephination-scleracorneal-removal-technique"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6365565,"mean":5.9832387637609,"rank":5421646,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6365565,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":165319,"mean":9.6393437980136,"rank":136260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":165319,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":510,"mean":2.2318428290766,"rank":273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":510,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":1.06,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/eyecenterllc\/status\/592734340372660225","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3945405],"posted_on":"2015-04-27T16:57:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Eye Center","url":"http:\/\/eyecenterllc.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/355341300\/apple-touch-icon_normal.png","description":"Ophthalmologists - Eye Physicians and Surgeons.
