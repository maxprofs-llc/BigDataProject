We analyzed the gut archaeal population by extracting DNA from the feces of nine piglets. We performed PCR to target the V6-V8 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Subsequent denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) revealed the presence of Methanobrevibacter boviskoreani, which was not previously identified in pigs. We confirmed these data with a PCR-DGGE analysis of the mcrA gene, and subsequent sequencing. At 63 days old, the only band in fecal samples corresponded to M. boviskoreani. The DGGE analysis also showed that Methanobrevibacter smithii, which was abundant at 28 days, was dramatically reduced at 42 days, and it completely disappeared at 63 days. To confirm these data, we quantified M. smithii and the total archaeal population with quantitative PCR (qPCR); moreover, we designed a new set of species-specific primers based on the 16S rRNA gene of M. boviskoreani. The qPCR results confirmed the reduction in M. smithii over time and a simultaneous increase in M. boviskoreani. At 63 days, the total numbers of archaea and M. boviskoreani genomes were comparable, which suggested that M. boviskoreani represented the dominant archaea. This work showed that the archaeal population shifted during weaning, and M. boviskoreani replaced M. smithii.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028c4","authors":["Federici, Sara","Miragoli, Francesco","Pisacane, Vincenza","Rebecchi, Annalisa","Morelli, Lorenzo","Callegari, Maria Luisa"],"doi":"10.1093\/femsle\/fnv064","first_seen_on":"2015-04-24T23:17:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1574-6968"],"journal":"FEMS Microbiology Letters","last_mentioned_on":1454065510,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25903267?dopt=Abstract&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25903267?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/femsle.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/362\/10\/fnv064"],"pmid":"25903267","pubdate":"2015-04-25T22:04:58+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Archaeal microbiota population in piglet feces shifts in response to weaning: Methanobrevibacter smithii is replaced with Methanobrevibacter boviskoreani","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/archaeal-microbiota-population-piglet-feces-shifts-response-weaning-methanobrevibacter-smithii-repla"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8039257,"mean":6.8266728911201,"rank":1710064,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6319323,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8039257,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":206368,"mean":9.0205775826563,"rank":54717,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":151157,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":206368,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1417,"mean":2.9599152542373,"rank":190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":1222,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1417,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.7036363636364,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
