In the case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, a proteolytic virulence factor, LasB, is one such target. Unfortunately, we and others have not been successful in translating in\u00a0vitro potency of LasB inhibitors to in\u00a0vivo efficacy in an animal model. To overcome this obstacle, we now integrate in\u00a0silico and in\u00a0vitro identification of the mercaptoacetamide motif as an effective class of LasB inhibitors with full in\u00a0vivo characterization of mercaptoacetamide prodrugs using Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that one of our mercaptoacetamide prodrugs has a good selectivity profile and high in\u00a0vivo efficacy, and confirm that LasB is a promising target for the treatment of bacterial infections. In addition, our work highlights that the C.\u00a0elegans infection model is a user-friendly and cost-effective translational tool for the development of anti-virulence compounds.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024f0","authors":["Zhu, Jie","Cai, Xiaoqing","Harris, Tyler L","Gooyit, Major","Wood, Malcolm","Lardy, Matthew","Janda, Kim D"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.chembiol.2015.03.012","first_seen_on":"2015-04-28T12:36:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-1301","1074-5521"],"journal":"Chemistry & Biology","last_mentioned_on":1430226815,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cell.com%2Fchemistry-biology%2Fabstract%2FS1074-5521%252815%252900105-2&code=cell-site","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25892201?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S1074552115001052\/pdf","pmid":"25892201","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry","biology","biochemistry"],"title":"Disarming Pseudomonas aeruginosa Virulence Factor LasB by Leveraging a Caenorhabditis elegans Infection Model.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/disarming-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-virulence-factor-lasb-leveraging-caenorhabditis-elegans-infection-m"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5033103,"mean":5.9706683627741,"rank":1127881,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":3896458,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5033103,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155866,"mean":9.6504734738397,"rank":47595,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":107740,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155866,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":903,"mean":4.9009578713969,"rank":211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":689,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":903,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":5.3058333333333,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
