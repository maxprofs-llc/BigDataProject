Standardised systematic review methods were used by two reviewers independently assessing eligibility, extracting data and evaluating study quality. A narrative summary was produced.\nThe searches identified 626 articles of which 64 were eligible. Forty-three different health literacy instruments were identified. The quality of these instruments, based on their psychometric properties, varied considerably. The majority of health literacy instruments were found to only assess communicative health literacy of which the numeracy element was often not represented. The NVS instrument was found to be the most practical health literacy instrument to use.\nThere is an urgent need to develop and psychometrically test a more encompassing health literacy instrument applicable in clinical settings as well as health promotion in general.\nIn the absence of a more comprehensive health literacy instrument, the NVS is a practical instrument to quickly assess for health literacy in a clinical setting.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032a1","authors":["Paul Duell","Debi Bhattacharya","David Wright","Andre M.N.
