However, in the presence of fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide, we show that the non-neutralizing antibodies induced by HIV-1 gp41 NHR domain (N63) exhibit potent and broad neutralizing activity against laboratory-adapted HIV-1 strains, including the drug-resistant variants, and primary HIV-1 isolates with different subtypes, suggesting the potential of developing gp41-targeted HIV therapeutic vaccines.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f92","authors":["Wang, Qian","Bi, Wenwen","Zhu, Xiaojie","Li, Haoyang","Qi, Qianqian","Yu, Fei","Lu, Lu","Jiang, Shibo"],"doi":"10.1128\/jvi.00791-15","first_seen_on":"2015-04-28T12:55:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1098-5514"],"journal":"Journal of Virology","last_mentioned_on":1430225725,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25903343"],"pmid":"25903343","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Non-neutralizing antibodies induced by HIV-1 gp41 NHR domain gain neutralizing activity in the presence of HIV fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide: a potential therapeutic vaccine strategy.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nonneutralizing-antibodies-induced-hiv1-gp41-nhr-domain-gain-neutralizing-activity-presence-hiv-fusi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5032982,"mean":5.9702113860563,"rank":3532289,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":846216,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5032982,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155865,"mean":9.6505276908075,"rank":112864,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":25890,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155865,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5376,"mean":3.507504744186,"rank":3933,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":764,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5376,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103,"mean":6.7154901960784,"rank":76,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
