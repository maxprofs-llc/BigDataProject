This regulatory immunity is mediated by a melanocortin-driven suppressor APC that presents autoantigen and uses adenosine to activate an antigen-specific CD4(+) Tregs through the A2Ar. These cells are highly effective in suppressing uveitis, and they appear to be inducible Tregs. In this study, we determined whether they are inducible or natural Tregs and identified the dependent mechanism for the function of these post-EAU Tregs. The post-EAU spleen CD25(+)CD4(+) T cells were sorted for NRP-1 expression and transferred to recipient mice immunized for EAU. The sorted NRP-1(-), but not the NRP-1(+), Tregs suppressed EAU. These NRP-1(-) Tregs coexpress PD-1 and PD-L1. Treatment of naive APCs with \u03b1-MSH promoted a regulatory APC that induced CD25(+) CD4(+) Tregs in a CD73-dependent manner. These Tregs were PD-L1(+) PD-1(+) NRP-1(-) FOXP3(+) HELIOS(-) and suppressed EAU when transferred to recipient mice. In contrast, PD-1(-) T cells did not suppress EAU, indicating that PD-1 is necessary for the suppressive activity of iTregs. Moreover, these Tregs did not suppress effector T cells when the PD\/-1\/PD-L1 pathway was blocked. These results demonstrate that post-EAU Tregs are inducible Tregs, which use a PD-1\/PD-L1 mechanism to suppress disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007d16","authors":["Darren J.
