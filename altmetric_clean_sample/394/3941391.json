Despite the prevalence and severity in this population, symptoms continue to be under-recognized and inadequately managed. The recognition of specific intradialytic pain syndromes such as pain related to arteriovenous access, headaches, muscle cramps or generalized pain by providers may aid in improving patient compliance and quality of life. The approach to pain management in end stage renal disease patients follows that of the general population with specific considerations regarding clearance and potential side effects guiding selection of agents. Overall, evidence is limited regarding the pharmacology of many medications in this population.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f610003509","authors":["Koncicki, Holly M","Brennan, Frank","Vinen, Katie","Davison, Sara N","Koncicki, Holly M.","Davison, Sara N."],"doi":"10.1111\/sdi.12372","endpage":"391","first_seen_on":"2015-04-25T12:17:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1525-139X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Seminars in Dialysis","last_mentioned_on":1480401102,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/25864854\/","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/sdi.12372\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/sdi.12372\/pdf","pmid":"25864854","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"384","subjects":["nephrology"],"title":"An Approach to Pain Management in End Stage Renal Disease: Considerations for General Management and Intradialytic Symptoms","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/approach-pain-management-end-stage-renal-disease-considerations-general-management-intradialytic-sym"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.55,"score_history":{"1y":2.2,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7822782,"mean":6.6331385505942,"rank":1554720,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6260851,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7822782,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":205169,"mean":8.8828318548703,"rank":51307,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":153572,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":205169,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":376,"mean":2.8580853333333,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":316,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":376,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.5791666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
