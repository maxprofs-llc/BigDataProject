We inject overlapping regions of an axon target area with three or more different colored retrograde tracers. On the basis of the combinations and intensities of the colors in the individual vesicles transported to neuronal somata, we calculate the projection sites of each neuron's axon. This neuronal positioning system (NPS) enables mapping of many axons in a simple automated way. In our experiments, NPS combined with spectral (Brainbow) labeling of the input to autonomic ganglion cells showed that the locations of ganglion cell projections to a mouse salivary gland related to the identities of their preganglionic axonal innervation. NPS could also delineate projections of many axons simultaneously in the mouse central nervous system.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000426c","authors":["Shlomo Tsuriel","Shlomo Tsuriel","Sagi Gudes","Ryan W Draft","Alexander M Binshtok","Jeff W Lichtman"],"doi":"10.1038\/nmeth.3367","first_seen_on":"2015-04-27T16:44:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1548-7105"],"journal":"Nature Methods","last_mentioned_on":1474007089,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/nmeth.3367","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nmeth\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/nmeth.3367.html","http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/nmeth\/rss\/aop\/~3\/2WkPU69VWP4\/nmeth.3367","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/nmeth.3367","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25915122","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nmeth\/journal\/v12\/n6\/full\/nmeth.3367.html?WT.ec_id=NMETH-201506","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nmeth\/journal\/v12\/n6\/full\/nmeth.3367.html","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25915122?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25915122","pubdate":"2015-04-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Development of the nervous system","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Mouse","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Fluorescence imaging","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques"],"title":"Multispectral labeling technique to map many neighboring axonal projections in the same tissue.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multispectral-labeling-technique-map-neighboring-axonal-projections-same-tissue"},"altmetric_score":{"score":109.642,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":109.642},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8389481,"mean":7.0670107241375,"rank":76926,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":8312580,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8389481,"percentile":99},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208533,"mean":9.065056499722,"rank":2712,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":205821,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208533,"percentile":98},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2861,"mean":21.105523076923,"rank":113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":2748,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2861,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104,"mean":24.233572815534,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":97,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":16,"researcher":5,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":16,"Scientists":5,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":36,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
