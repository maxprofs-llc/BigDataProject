Sensitivity of the strain gauge required varies, depending on the application of the strain gauge. This paper reports a tunable strain gauge based on a two-dimensional percolative network of silver nanowires. By varying the surface coverage of the nanowire network and the waviness of the nanowires in the network, the sensitivity of the strain gauge can be controlled. Hence, a tunable strain gauge can be engineered, based on demands of the application. A few applications are demonstrated. The strain gauge can be adhered to the human neck to detect throat movements and a glove integrated with such a strain gauge can detect the bending of the forefinger. Other classes of two-dimensional percolative networks of one-dimensional materials are also expected to exhibit similar tunable properties.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003146","authors":["Xinning Ho"],"doi":"10.1088\/0957-4484\/26\/19\/195504","first_seen_on":"2015-04-27T23:44:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1361-6528"],"issue":"19","journal":"Nanotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1430126460,"links":["http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/0957-4484\/26\/19\/195504\/article"],"pmid":"25902896","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Tunable strain gauges based on two-dimensional silver nanowire networks - Abstract - Nanotechnology - IOPscience","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tunable-strain-gauges-based-twodimensional-silver-nanowire-networks"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.848,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.848},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5033220,"mean":5.9655498050018,"rank":749249,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":4283530,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5033220,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":157121,"mean":9.6371811227088,"rank":34308,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":122801,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":157121,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1098,"mean":5.408289881495,"rank":190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":761,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1098,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":5.8095072463768,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
