Transvesical reconstruction was performed in 2 cases. After the diagnosis of VVF, the third girl was discharged home with Foley catheter drainage. Three months later, she presented with pregnancy and was lost to follow-up.\nEvaluation of unusual urinary symptoms in an adolescent should include vaginal examination and\/or imaging. Aerosol spray caps remain the most common vaginal foreign body resulting in VVFs in adolescent girls in Lithuania. Transvesical reconstruction is safe and efficient.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002eac","authors":["Vilimas, Juozas","Baseviciene, Ingrida","Kilda, Arturas","Puzinas, Albertas","Verkauskas, Gilvydas"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jpag.2015.04.009","first_seen_on":"2015-04-27T06:25:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1083-3188","1873-4332"],"journal":"Journal of Pediatric & Adolescent Gynecology","last_mentioned_on":1430115912,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=9&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jpagonline.org%2Farticle%2FS1083-3188%252815%252900177-1%2Fabstract&code=pedado-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jpagonline.org\/article\/S1083318815001771\/pdf","pmid":"26130138","pubdate":"2015-07-02T22:08:18+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics","gynecology"],"title":"Vesicovaginal fistula in adolescent girls: incidence and management","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vesicovaginal-fistula-adolescent-girls-incidence-management"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5033220,"mean":5.9655498050018,"rank":4192599,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5033220,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":157115,"mean":9.6378445714577,"rank":131499,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":157115,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":335,"mean":2.6989520958084,"rank":246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":335,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.3809523809524,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IN":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/FertilityUpdate\/status\/592575204070559744","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3944020],"posted_on":"2015-04-27T06:25:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Fertility.Update","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/442565627513810944\/isEsCPyy_normal.png","description":"Latest updates related to male as well as female fertility.","id_on_source":"FertilityUpdate","tweeter_id":"2258460362","geo":{"lt":19.07283,"ln":72.88261,"country":"IN"},"followers":358},"tweet_id":"592575204070559744"}]}}
