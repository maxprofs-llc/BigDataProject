A review of literature was performed on all eligible reports using this modality as the first-line treatment of CSP. Relevant publications were obtained from the PubMed electronic database from inception to December 2014. Ninety-six cases from 95 women reported in 17 articles were reviewed. The success rate was 73.9% after single local methotrexate injection. An accumulated success rate of 88.5% could be achieved after additional local or intramuscular methotrexate administration. Eleven cases (11.5%) had failed methotrexate treatment and required surgical interventions. Except for women with serum human chorionic gonadotropin level higher than 100,000 IU\/L, ultrasound-guided local methotrexate injection could be considered as a first-line treatment modality for CSP.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d61","authors":["Cheung, Vincent Y T"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jmig.2015.04.008","first_seen_on":"2015-04-25T02:36:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1553-4669","1553-4650"],"journal":"Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology","last_mentioned_on":1429929314,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jmig.org%2Farticle%2FS1553-4650%252815%252900293-9%2Fabstract&code=jmig-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jmig.org\/article\/S1553465015002939\/pdf","pmid":"25889882","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gynecology"],"title":"Local methotrexate injection as the first-line treatment for cesarean scar pregnancy: a review of the literature","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/local-methotrexate-injection-firstline-treatment-cesarean-scar-pregnancy-review-literature-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5035310,"mean":5.9603441234732,"rank":4208985,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5035310,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156858,"mean":9.6827678331221,"rank":131357,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156858,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":385,"mean":2.0488697916667,"rank":213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":385,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":9.7494117647059,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IN":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/FertilityUpdate\/status\/591792553785196544","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3940592],"posted_on":"2015-04-25T02:35:14+00:00","author":{"name":"Fertility.Update","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/442565627513810944\/isEsCPyy_normal.png","description":"Latest updates related to male as well as female fertility.","id_on_source":"FertilityUpdate","tweeter_id":"2258460362","geo":{"lt":19.07283,"ln":72.88261,"country":"IN"},"followers":362},"tweet_id":"591792553785196544"}]}}
