However, in most countries, the number of people willing to donate their body is low. A 3D printed model could be an alternative method for morphology research, but the accuracy of the morphology of a 3D printed model has not been determined.\nForty-five computed tomography (CT) scans of cervical, thoracic and lumbar spines were obtained, and 44 parameters of the cervical spine, 120 parameters of the thoracic spine, and 50 parameters of the lumbar spine were measured. The CT scan data in DICOM format were imported into Mimics software v10.01 for 3D reconstruction, and the data were saved in .STL format and imported to Cura software. After a 3D digital model was formed, it was saved in Gcode format and exported to a 3D printer for printing. After the 3D printed models were obtained, the above-referenced parameters were measured again.\nPaired t-tests were used to determine the significance, set to P<0.05, of all parameter data from the radiographic images and 3D printed models. Furthermore, 88.6% of all parameters of the cervical spine, 90% of all parameters of the thoracic spine, and 94% of all parameters of the lumbar spine had Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) values >0.800. The other ICC values were <0.800 and >0.600; none were <0.600.\nIn this study, we provide a protocol for printing accurate 3D spinal models for surgeons and researchers. The resulting 3D printed model is inexpensive and easily obtained for spinal fixation research.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Ai-Min Wu","Zhen-Xuan Shao","Jian-Shun Wang","Xin-Dong Yang","Wan-Qing Weng","Xiang-Yang Wang","Hua-Zi Xu","Yong-Long Chi","Zhong-Ke Lin"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0124291","first_seen_on":"2015-04-28T07:58:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"4","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1431019003,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0124291","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25915641"],"pmid":"25915641","pubdate":"2015-04-27T07:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"The Accuracy of a Method for Printing Three-Dimensional Spinal Models.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/accuracy-method-printing-three-dimensional-spinal-models"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5067557,"mean":6.0017196092174,"rank":1234387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3819735,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5067557,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156484,"mean":9.6617334662553,"rank":51781,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":103977,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156484,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89436,"mean":9.3232221613462,"rank":27481,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":61539,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89436,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5706,"mean":8.7554597721297,"rank":1847,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":3826,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5706,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
