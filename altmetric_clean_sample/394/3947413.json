The coil, which is referred to as an X0 shim coil, is wound to produce a uniform static magnetic field Bx perpendicular to the main magnetic field B0. The magnetic field felt by a sample is a vector sum of the main field B0 and the transverse field Bx produced by the X0 shim coil. Hence the angle between the spinner axis and the effective magnetic field can be controlled by current I supplied to the X0 shim coil, leading to precise angle adjustment without backlash accompanied with a mechanical system conventionally used. It is shown that the angle range achieved is \u00b10.05\u00b0 for I=\u00b15A at B0=7T.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e26","authors":["Matsunaga, Tatsuya","Mizuno, Takashi","Takegoshi, K"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jmr.2015.04.007","first_seen_on":"2015-04-28T01:32:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["10907807","1096-0856"],"journal":"Journal of Magnetic Resonance","last_mentioned_on":1430184729,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1090780715000919"],"pmid":"25956137","pubdate":"2015-05-10T22:02:58+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["diagnosticimaging"],"title":"An X0 shim coil for precise magic-angle adjustment ","type":"article","volume":"256","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/xinf0inf-shim-coil-precise-magicangle-adjustment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5032982,"mean":5.9702113860563,"rank":3532292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":846216,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5032982,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155864,"mean":9.650591853102,"rank":112864,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":25890,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155864,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":402,"mean":1.4536708229426,"rank":229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":402,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":3.925,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
