Here, associations of APOL1 genotype with urine biomarkers of glomerular and tubular injury and kidney function decline were evaluated.\nObservational study.\n431 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected African American women enrolled in Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS).\nAPOL1 genotype.\nAlbumin-creatinine ratio (ACR), 4 tubular injury biomarkers (interleukin 18 [IL-18], kidney injury molecule 1 [KIM-1], neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin [NGAL], and \u03b11-microglobulin [A1M]), and kidney function estimated using the CKD-EPI cystatin C equation.\nParticipants were genotyped for APOL1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs73885319 (G1 allele) and rs71785313 (G2 allele). Urine biomarkers were measured using stored samples from 1999-2000. Cystatin C was measured using serum collected at baseline and 4- and 8-year follow-ups.\nAt baseline, ACRs were higher among 47 women with 2 APOL1 risk alleles versus 384 women with 0\/1 risk allele (median, 24 vs 11mg\/g; P<0.001). Compared with women with 0\/1 risk allele, women with 2 risk alleles had 104% higher ACRs (95% CI, 29-223mg\/g) and 2-fold greater risk of ACR>30 (95% CI, 1.17-3.44) mg\/g after multivariable adjustment. APOL1 genotype showed little association with urine IL-18:Cr ratio, KIM-1:Cr ratio, and NGAL:Cr ratio (estimates of\u00a0-5% [95% CI,\u00a0-24% to 18%],\u00a0-20% [95% CI,\u00a0-36% to -1%], and 10% [95% CI,\u00a0-26% to 64%], respectively) or detectable urine A1M (prevalence ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.65-1.97) in adjusted analyses. Compared with women with 0\/1 allele, women with 2 risk alleles had faster eGFR decline, by 1.2 (95% CI,\u00a00.2 to\u00a02.2) mL\/min\/1.73m(2) per year, and 1.7- and 3.4-fold greater rates of incident chronic kidney disease (95% CI, 1.1 to 2.5) and 10% annual eGFR decline (95% CI, 1.7 to 6.7), respectively, with minimal attenuation after adjustment for glomerular and tubular injury biomarker levels.\nResults may not be generalizable to men.\nAmong HIV-infected African American women, APOL1-associated kidney injury appears to localize to the glomerulus, rather than the tubules.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f61000570b","authors":["Jotwani, Vasantha","Shlipak, Michael G","Scherzer, Rebecca","Parekh, Rulan S","Kao, W H Linda","Bennett, Michael","Cohen, Mardge H","Nowicki, Marek","Sharma, Anjali","Young, Mary","Tien, Phyllis C","Parikh, Chirag R","Estrella, Michelle M"],"doi":"10.1053\/j.ajkd.2015.02.329","first_seen_on":"2015-04-26T12:44:18+00:00","funders":["niehs","niams","niaid"],"issns":["0272-6386","1523-6838"],"journal":"American Journal of Kidney Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1430052195,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=9&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ajkd.org%2Farticle%2FS0272-6386%252815%252900510-7%2Fabstract&code=yajkd-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ajkd.org\/article\/S0272638615005107\/pdf","pmid":"25921719","pubdate":"2015-04-30T22:01:59+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nephrology"],"title":"APOL1 Genotype and Glomerular and Tubular Kidney Injury in Women With HIV","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/apol1-genotype-glomerular-tubular-kidney-injury-women-hiv"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039712,"mean":5.9641504891867,"rank":3563800,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":827441,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039712,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156900,"mean":9.6376850075528,"rank":115470,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":25475,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156900,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1382,"mean":4.3617610427227,"rank":1042,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":172,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1382,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":8.162,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
