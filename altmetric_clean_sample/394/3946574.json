The aim of the present meta-analysis was to establish the role of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of meniscal injury by analyzing the data from prospectively designed studies.\nA systematic review was performed by searching electronic bibliographic databases prior to November 2014. Studies with diagnostic results that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were included. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed. Sensitivity, specificity and other measures of the accuracy of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of meniscal injury were summarized. Summary receiver-operating characteristic (SROC) curves were used to summarize overall test performance. Publication bias was assessed used Deek's funnel plot asymmetry test.\nSeven prospective studies with 551 patients were eligible for the meta-analysis. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies scores for the included studies ranged from 10-13. The summary estimates of the sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio and diagnostic odds ratio of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of meniscal injury were 0.88 (95\u00a0% CI 0.84-0.91), 0.90 (95\u00a0% CI 0.86-0.93), 7.07 (95\u00a0% CI 4.34-11.52), 0.17 (95\u00a0% CI 0.10-0.26) and 58.13 (95\u00a0% CI 24.38-138.62), respectively. There was moderate to significant heterogeneity across the above measures (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The area under the curve of the SROC was 0.948, indicating a high overall diagnostic accuracy. No publication bias was noted across the studies (P\u00a0=\u00a00.393), which suggested little influence of publication bias on the overall results.\nOur results suggest that the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography for diagnosing meniscal injury is acceptable, with a high specificity but moderate sensitivity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002ea2","authors":["Hai Dai","Zong-gui Huang","Zhi-jian Chen","Jin-xin Liu"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00776-015-0728-2","first_seen_on":"2015-04-27T22:57:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1436-2023"],"journal":"Journal of Orthopaedic Science","last_mentioned_on":1433655556,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00776-015-0728-2"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00776-015-0728-2.pdf","pmid":"25916746","pubdate":"2015-04-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Japan","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Orthopedics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Rheumatology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography in assessing meniscal injury: meta-analysis of prospective studies","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diagnostic-accuracy-ultrasonography-assessing-meniscal-injury-metaanalysis-prospective-studies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5200000,"mean":6.1332428102415,"rank":1267732,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3919888,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5200000,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159564,"mean":9.6906149420606,"rank":52550,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":106478,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159564,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":368,"mean":1.2136348773842,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":331,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":368,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":0.83518518518519,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
