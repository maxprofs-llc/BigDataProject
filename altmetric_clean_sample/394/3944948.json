The first and last species have mainly been identified in Middle Eastern countries (e.g. Kinzelbach and R\u00fcckert 1985). The second species has been identified only in Romania Dobruja (Manoleli 1972). Although Limnatis leeches are well known species of endoparasitic leeches, Limnatisnilotica was recorded only once in Kazakhstan (Lukin 1976).\nSpecimens of the genus Limnatis from Almaty Province, Kazakhstan are identified as Limnatispaluda. This is the first record of Limnatispaluda from Kazakhstan. Mitochondrial COI and 12S data demonstrated that the present specimens are genetically close to an Israeli specimen identified as Limnatisnilotica. In addition, molecular data suggest that some Limnatis specimens whose DNA sequences have been reported were misidentified. According to the observed phylogenetic relationships, the taxonomic status of the known Limnatis species should be revisited.","altmetric_jid":"552536762a83eec8018b456a","authors":["Takafumi Nakano","Takafumi Nakano"," Tatjana Dujsebayeva"," Kanto Nishikawa"],"doi":"10.3897\/bdj.3.e5004","first_seen_on":"2015-04-27T13:53:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1314-2828"],"issue":"3","journal":"Biodiversity Data Journal","last_mentioned_on":1430142783,"links":["http:\/\/bdj.pensoft.net\/articles.php?id=5004"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bdj.pensoft.net\/lib\/ajax_srv\/generate_pdf.php?readonly_preview=1&document_id=5004","pmid":"25941456","pubdate":"2015-05-06T22:01:05+00:00","publisher":"Pensoft Publishers","title":"First record of Limnatis paluda (Hirudinida, Arhynchobdellida, Praobdellidae) from Kazakhstan, with comments on genetic diversity of Limnatis leeches","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/first-record-limnatispaluda-hirudinida-arhynchobdellida-praobdellidae-kazakhstan-comments-genetic-di"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5033220,"mean":5.9655498050018,"rank":3544648,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":840163,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5033220,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":157121,"mean":9.6374041878819,"rank":115302,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":25611,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":157121,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257,"mean":8.58946875,"rank":224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":4.5452777777778,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
