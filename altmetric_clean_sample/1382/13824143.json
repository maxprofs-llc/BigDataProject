A second objective was to determine if OA prescribing decisions would differ based on the patient's relationship to the provider.\nWe distributed an electronic survey to a random sample of ED providers at participating centers in a nationwide research consortium. Question topics included provider attitudes about OA prescribing, prior personal therapeutic use of OAs (indications, dosing, and disposal of leftover medication), and hypothetical analgesic-prescribing decisions for their patients, family members, and themselves for different painful conditions.\nThe total survey population was 957 individuals; 515 responded to the survey, a 54% response rate. Prior personal therapeutic OA use was reported in 63% (95% CI = [58-68]). A majority of these providers (82%; 95% CI = [77-87]) took fewer than half the number of pills prescribed. Regarding provider attitudes towards OA prescribing, 66% (95% CI = [61-71]) agreed that OA could lead to addiction even with short-term use. When providers were asked if they would prescribe OA to a patient with 10\/10 pain from an ankle sprain, 21% (95% CI = [17-25]) would for an adult patient, 13% (95% CI = [10-16]) would for an adult family member, and 6% (95% CI = [4-8]) indicated they themselves would take an opioid for the same pain. When the scenario involved an ankle fracture, 86% (95% CI = [83-89]) would prescribe OA for an adult patient, 75% (95% CI = [71-79]) for an adult family member, and 52% (95% CI = [47-57]) would themselves take OA. Providers who have personally used OA to treat their pain were found to make similar prescribing decisions compared to those who had not.\nNo consistent differences in prescribing decisions were found between ED providers based on their prior therapeutic use of OA. When making OA prescribing decisions, ED providers report that they are less likely to prescribe opioids to their family members, or themselves, than to an ED patient with the same painful condition.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008cc9","authors":["Adam C.
