This suggestion spawned a number of concerns, including who the scientists in our field are, whether our professional definition of language is used in our language theories and intervention approaches, and what we say the \"best\" intervention is. In this article, these issues are discussed as discrepancies, along with some suggestions for addressing these gaps, in order to integrate science into all of our professional endeavors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fe1","authors":["Kenn Apel"],"doi":"10.1044\/0161-1461.3001.98","first_seen_on":"2015-04-14T20:23:15+00:00","issns":["0161-1461","1558-9129"],"issue":"1","journal":"Language, Speech & Hearing Services in Schools","last_mentioned_on":1429080127,"links":["http:\/\/lshss.pubs.asha.org\/article.aspx?articleid=1780221"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/lshss.pubs.asha.org\/data\/Journals\/LSHSS\/929209\/lshss_30_1_98.pdf","pmid":"27764295","pubdate":"2016-10-22T22:08:29+00:00","publisher":"American Speech-Language-Hearing Association","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Specialist Studies In Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Health Professions","Social Sciences","Arts and Humanities"],"subjects":["audiology","healthservices","speechlanguagepathology"],"title":"Checks and BalancesKeeping the Science in Our Profession","type":"article","volume":"30"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5033220,"mean":5.9655498050018,"rank":2487889,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2392698,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5033220,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":152290,"mean":9.9805865820907,"rank":80706,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":64960,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":152290,"percentile":42},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207,"mean":4.9352912621359,"rank":146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":12.19,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ASHAJournals\/status\/588074299006779392","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3908092],"posted_on":"2015-04-14T20:20:13+00:00","author":{"name":"ASHA Journals","url":"http:\/\/journals.pubs.asha.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/561260823583002624\/52r3FZbH_normal.jpeg","description":"Discover more from ASHA's high-impact research journals: AJA, AJSLP, JSLHR, and LSHSS.
