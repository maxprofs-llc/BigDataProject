Two large-scale meta-analyses recently published in Nature by Shungin et\u00a0al. (2015) and Locke et\u00a0al. (2015) report novel genetic associations for central and overall obesity; these greatly advance our understanding of the biology of obesity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067cf","authors":["Fu, Jingyuan","Hofker, Marten","Wijmenga, Cisca","Jingyuan Fu","Marten Hofker","Cisca Wijmenga"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cmet.2015.03.016","endpage":"508","first_seen_on":"2015-04-14T10:17:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-7420","15504131"],"issue":"4","journal":"Cell Metabolism (Science Direct)","last_mentioned_on":1429006623,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1550413115001199"],"pmid":"25863240","pubdate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"507","subjects":["metabolism","cellbiology"],"title":"Apple or Pear: Size and Shape Matter ","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1550413115001199","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/apple-pear-size-shape-matter"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4995465,"mean":5.9123221894921,"rank":4176806,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4995465,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":151052,"mean":9.9816955068157,"rank":126550,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":151052,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1148,"mean":22.56295727986,"rank":1102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1148,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":36.634215384615,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
