The method utilizes aqueous sodium azide solution as the azide source and can be performed under air. Besides its operational simplicity, the potential of this method for late-stage functionalization has been demonstrated by successful azidation of various bioactive molecules with yields up to 74%, including the important drugs pregabalin, memantine, and the antimalarial artemisinin. Azidation of celestolide with a chiral manganese salen catalyst afforded the azide product in 70% ee, representing a Mn-catalyzed enantioselective aliphatic C-H azidation reaction. Considering the versatile roles of organic azides in modern chemistry and the ubiquity of aliphatic C-H bonds in organic molecules, we envision that this Mn-azidation method will find wide application in organic synthesis, drug discovery, and chemical biology.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Xiongyi Huang"],"doi":"10.1021\/jacs.5b01983","first_seen_on":"2015-04-14T23:02:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-5126"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1431044160,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jacs.5b01983","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/jacs.5b01983"],"pmid":"25871027","pubdate":"2015-04-15T22:00:48+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Manganese-Catalyzed Late-Stage Aliphatic C\u2013H Azidation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/manganesecatalyzed-latestage-aliphatic-ch-azidation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":31.142,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":31.142},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5067557,"mean":6.0017196092174,"rank":152874,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":4914690,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5067557,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":152274,"mean":10.00280837706,"rank":8916,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":143357,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":152274,"percentile":94},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15300,"mean":4.6267655402314,"rank":220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":15080,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15300,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":222,"mean":6.5414932126697,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":222,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
