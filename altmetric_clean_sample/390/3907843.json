After further investigation, 54 patients underwent FDG-PET\/CT. Post-operative pathology examinations revealed malignancies in 26 lesions, including invasive breast cancer in 11 cases and non-invasive breast cancer in 15 cases, as well as benign disease in 30 lesions. The FDG-PET\/CT findings from the whole-body scans were positive for 9 of 11 invasive breast cancers (81.8%) and 3 of 15 non-invasive cancers (20%), and they were negative for all benign lesions. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of FDG-PET\/CT with whole-body supine imaging were 46.2%, 100%, 100% and 68.2%, respectively. Breast prone imaging revealed another patient with ductal carcinoma in situ, increasing the sensitivity to 50%. Importantly, positive PET findings were significantly correlated with tumour histology (P\u2009=\u20090.006), tumour size (P\u2009=\u20090.039) and Ki-67 expression (P\u2009=\u20090.011).\nFDG-PET\/CT with whole-body scanning demonstrated high sensitivity to invasive breast cancer, limited sensitivity to non-invasive breast cancer, and high specificity for breast cancer. FDG-PET\/CT might be useful for differentiating tumour invasiveness. However, the good PPV but poor NPV do not allow the physician to discard the biopsy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e43","authors":["Peng, Nan\u2010Jing","Chou, Chen\u2010Pin","Pan, Huay\u2010Ben","Chang, Tsung\u2010Hsien","Hu, Chin","Chiu, Yu\u2010Li","Fu, Ting\u2010Ying","Chang, Hong\u2010Tai"],"doi":"10.1111\/1754-9485.12309","endpage":"452","first_seen_on":"2015-04-14T18:48:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1754-9485"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Medical Imaging & Radiation Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1433178486,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1754-9485.12309\/abstract;jsessionid=CDF1811942C1DB28FF0D525CFC7E3AF6.f03t04","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25872026?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25872026?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25872026?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25872026"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1754-9485.12309\/pdf","pmid":"25872026","pubdate":"2015-04-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"445","subjects":["radiology","neoplasms","diagnosticimaging"],"title":"FDG-PET\/CT detection of very early breast cancer in women with breast microcalcification lesions found in mammography screening.","type":"article","volume":"59","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fdgpetct-detection-very-early-breast-cancer-women-breast-microcalcification-lesions-found-mammograph-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8282457,"mean":6.9838688277901,"rank":1345470,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":6932729,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8282457,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":203730,"mean":9.2746020056056,"rank":43847,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":159694,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":203730,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":298,"mean":4.6281683501683,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":255,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":298,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":2.8613636363636,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":8}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":6,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
