To inform clinical practice, we performed a systematic review on the beneficial effect and safety of CHM for MDR-TB.\nWe searched six electronic databases for randomised clinical trials (RCTs) of CHM for MDR-TB. We used RevMan 5.2 software for data analyses with effect estimates as risk ratio (RR) with 95% con\ufb01dence interval (CI).\n30 RCTs involving 3374 participants with MDR-TB were included. The methodological quality was generally poor in terms of risk of bias. Meta-analyses favoured CHM plus chemotherapy on sputum bacteriological conversion rate compared with chemotherapy alone after initiation of treatment (6th mos: RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.41, n\u00a0=\u00a012; 12th mos: RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.52, n\u00a0=\u00a06; 18th mos: RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.27, n\u00a0=\u00a09). Compared with chemotherapy alone, meta-analyses showed benefit from CHM plus chemotherapy on lung lesions resorption rate (6th mos: RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.32, n\u00a0=\u00a05; 12th mos: RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.45, n\u00a0=\u00a04; 18th mos: RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.32, n\u00a0=\u00a07) and cavity closure rate (12th mos: RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.07, n\u00a0=\u00a02; 18th mos: RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.53, n\u00a0=\u00a05), relapse rate (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.50, n\u00a0=\u00a04), and abnormal liver function (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.69, n\u00a0=\u00a014). No serious adverse effects were reported.\nCHM as an adjuvant to anti-TB chemotherapy may have beneficial effect for MDR-TB in terms of bacteriological and radiological outcomes, and is relatively safe. However, due to poor methodological reporting of the included trials, a confirmative conclusion needs to be supported by further robust clinical trials.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008c14","authors":["Wang, Mei","Guan, Xin","Chi, Yuan","Robinson, Nicola","Liu, Jian-Ping","Mei Wang","Xin Guan","Yuan Chi","Nicola Robinson","Jian-Ping Liu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.tube.2015.03.003","first_seen_on":"2015-04-13T13:41:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handle":"1959.7\/uws:35264","handles":["1959.7\/uws:35264"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1873-281X","1472-9792","14729792"],"issue":"4","journal":"Tuberculosis (formerly Tubercle and Lung Disease)","last_mentioned_on":1460302664,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25861717","http:\/\/www.tuberculosisjournal.com\/article\/S1472-9792(14)20598-1\/abstract","http:\/\/www.tuberculosisjournal.com\/article\/S1472-9792(14)20598-1\/pdf","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com.sci-hub.io\/science\/article\/pii\/S1472979214205981","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.tube.2015.03.003"],"pmid":"25861717","pubdate":"2015-04-13T22:01:46+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Chinese herbal medicine as adjuvant treatment to chemotherapy for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB): A systematic review of randomised clinical trials","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1472979214205981","volume":"95","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chinese-herbal-medicine-adjuvant-treatment-chemotherapy-multidrugresistant-tuberculosis-mdrtb-system-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7529066,"mean":6.5069445313556,"rank":3670884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3667920,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7529066,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":199479,"mean":9.0191658227977,"rank":99228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":92120,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":199479,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":338,"mean":2.5274183976261,"rank":141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":188,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":338,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.91666666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
