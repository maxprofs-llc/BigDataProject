Five studies assessed macroscopic and\/or microscopic sputum quality characteristics and M. tuberculosis detection. The other five studies assessed the impact of pre-sputum collection interventions on sputum quality and M. tuberculosis detection. No studies assessed the impact of sputum quality on PCR-based diagnostic tests.\nDefinitive conclusions about the utility of sputum quality assessments are limited by the paucity of, and heterogeneity within, the available data. Given the potential for sputum quality assessments to enhance diagnostic yield and prevent wasteful laboratory testing, further research into this field is urgently needed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f610007a18","authors":["Ho, J.","Ho, J","Marks, G B","Fox, G J","J.
