However, recent data suggest that besides their role in antibody production, B cells participate in antibody-independent responses, potentially leading to allograft rejection or allograft tolerance. The presence of CD20(+) B cells in kidney graft biopsies has been shown during severe acute rejection episodes and during chronic rejection. Furthermore, operationally tolerant kidney transplant recipients showed a clear B cell dominated fingerprint of tolerance. Several techniques exist to study B cells on different levels. Numerous classification schemes allow for the distinction of many different B cell subsets using flow cytometry. Regardless, data on B cell subsets during stable graft function, rejection or tolerance remain scarce. To obtain a complete picture of the role of B cells during transplantation, antigen specific B cell assays may be required. Therefore, techniques have now been developed that allow for studying the specificity and frequency of HLA specific B cells. Here, we present an overview of the existent assays, panels and techniques intended to characterize peripheral B cells, and the currently available HLA specific B cell functional assays that may allow for monitoring the humoral alloimmune response in transplant recipients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008bee","authors":["Crespo, Marta","Heidt, Sebastiaan","Redondo, Dolores","Pascual, Julio","Marta Crespo","Sebastiaan Heidt","Dolores Redondo","Julio Pascual"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.trre.2015.02.001","first_seen_on":"2015-04-15T04:34:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1557-9816","0955470X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Transplantation Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1486136166,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25867605?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25867605?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25867605","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.trre.2015.02.001"],"pmid":"25867605","pubdate":"2015-04-15T22:03:47+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Monitoring B cell subsets and alloreactivity in kidney transplantation.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0955470X15000051","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/monitoring-b-cell-subsets-alloreactivity-kidney-transplantation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8155605,"mean":6.9067370031636,"rank":4320979,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2263976,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8155605,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":202982,"mean":9.2478448229145,"rank":110800,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":71847,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":202982,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":1.3321212121212,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.79166666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
