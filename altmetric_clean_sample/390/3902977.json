Thus, sustainable fuel supply, security, and prices necessitate the implementation of alternative routes to the production of chemicals and fuels. Much attention has been focussed on use of cellulosic material, particularly through microbial-based processes. However, this is still costly and proving challenging, as are catalytic routes to biofuels from whole biomass. An alternative strategy is to directly capture carbon before incorporation into lignocellulosic biomass. Autotrophic acetogenic, carboxidotrophic, and methanotrophic bacteria are able to capture carbon as CO, CO2, or CH4, respectively, and reuse that carbon in products that displace their fossil-derived counterparts. Thus, gas fermentation represents a versatile industrial platform for the sustainable production of commodity chemicals and fuels from diverse gas resources derived from industrial processes, coal, biomass, municipal solid waste (MSW), and extracted natural gas.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000269f","authors":["D\u00fcrre, Peter","Eikmanns, Bernhard J"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.copbio.2015.03.008","first_seen_on":"2015-04-13T13:21:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-0429","09581669"],"journal":"Current Opinion in Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1430039170,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S095816691500052X","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S095816691500052X?via=ihub","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25841103"],"pmid":"25841103","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"C1-carbon sources for chemical and fuel production by microbial gas fermentation.","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/c1carbon-sources-chemical-fuel-production-microbial-gas-fermentation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.05,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5033220,"mean":5.9655498050018,"rank":1050884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":3976890,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5033220,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":152168,"mean":9.9794023014189,"rank":44426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":107528,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":152168,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":695,"mean":2.8355648414986,"rank":122,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":571,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":695,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.96875,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":43,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
