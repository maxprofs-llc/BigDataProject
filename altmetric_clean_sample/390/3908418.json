In this article, we present a room temperature simulation of liquid water based on the potential energy surface obtained by a many-body wave function through quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. The simulated properties are in good agreement with recent neutron scattering and X-ray experiments, particularly concerning the position of the oxygen-oxygen peak in the radial distribution function, at variance of previous density functional theory attempts. Given the excellent performances of QMC on large scale supercomputers, this work opens new perspectives for predictive and reliable ab initio simulations of complex chemical systems.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cee","authors":["Andrea Zen","Andrea Zen","Ye Luo","Guglielmo Mazzola","Leonardo Guidoni","Sandro Sorella"],"doi":"10.1063\/1.4917171","first_seen_on":"2015-04-14T23:08:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1089-7690"],"issue":"14","journal":"Journal of Chemical Physics","last_mentioned_on":1429052917,"links":["http:\/\/scitation.aip.org\/content\/aip\/journal\/jcp\/142\/14\/10.1063\/1.4917171"],"pmid":"25877566","pubdate":"2015-04-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"AIP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"title":"Ab initio molecular dynamics simulation of liquid water by quantum Monte Carlo","type":"article","volume":"142","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ab-initio-molecular-dynamics-simulation-liquid-water-quantum-monte-carlo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4995465,"mean":5.9123221894921,"rank":3533455,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":818607,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4995465,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":151057,"mean":9.9814455433748,"rank":110812,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":24510,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":151057,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4133,"mean":2.2919099709584,"rank":2217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":848,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4133,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":210,"mean":1.0169186602871,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":210,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
