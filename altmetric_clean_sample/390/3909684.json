Twelve male callisthenic athletes completed single vertical jump from a squat posture with hands on hips under three conditions as non-strapping (NS), moderate strapping (MS) and high strapping (HS) round metatarsals. Ground reaction force (GRF) was recorded with KISTLER force platform to calculate the vertical jump height. Angles of ankle, knee and hip were measured with VICON motion analysis system and EMG data were recorded with mega6000 system. Data showed that jump height was significantly higher under HS than NS condition. Compared with NS, ankle inversion decreased significantly during take-off and external rotation increased significantly during landing with MS. Significant difference was also found in the muscle activity of tibialis anterior between non-strapping and strapping conditions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002a10","authors":["Zhang, Yan","Baker, Julien S","Ren, Xuejun","Feng, Neng","Gu, Yaodong"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.humov.2015.03.013","first_seen_on":"2015-04-15T08:47:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1872-7646","01679457"],"journal":"Human Movement Science","last_mentioned_on":1429088443,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S016794571500055X"],"pmid":"25863191","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Metatarsal strapping tightness effect to vertical jump performance ","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metatarsal-strapping-tightness-effect-vertical-jump-performance"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5000595,"mean":5.9176901672108,"rank":2303205,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2570920,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5000595,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":151443,"mean":9.97423796569,"rank":73766,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":72579,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":151443,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":381,"mean":4.3624105263158,"rank":171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":202,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":381,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":4.45,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":5,"Student  > Bachelor":4,"Lecturer":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":2,"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Social Sciences":1,"Sports and Recreations":8,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Unspecified":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":2},"mendeley":{"CN":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ScienceSportUWS\/status\/588262074599477248","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3909684],"posted_on":"2015-04-15T08:46:22+00:00","author":{"name":"ScienceSportNewsUWS","url":"http:\/\/www.uws.ac.uk\/schools\/school-of-science\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/582495267460657152\/yETNjydO_normal.jpg","description":"News and updates from the School of Science & Sport UWS","id_on_source":"ScienceSportUWS","tweeter_id":"3110111111","geo":{"lt":56,"ln":-4,"country":"GB"},"followers":513},"tweet_id":"588262074599477248"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/easto82\/status\/588265685983330304","license":"datasift","rt":["ScienceSportUWS"],"citation_ids":[3909684],"posted_on":"2015-04-15T09:00:43+00:00","author":{"name":"Chris Easton","url":"https:\/\/scholar.google.co.uk\/citations?user=kxvFxpgAAAAJ&hl=en","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000640788882\/1911e0e2ef4bcd163274881da0dce60f_normal.jpeg","description":"Reader in Exercise Physiology @UniWestScotland.
