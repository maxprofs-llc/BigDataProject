The copper accumulation in different organs leads to the suspicion of Wilson disease. We describe a child with clinical zinc deficiency as presenting symptom of Wilson disease, which was confirmed by 2 mutations within the ATP7B gene and an increased copper excretion.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dcf","authors":["Van Biervliet, Stephanie","K\u00fcry, S\u00e9bastien","De Bruyne, Ruth","Vanakker, Olivier M","Schmitt, S\u00e9bastien","Vande Velde, Saskia","Blouin, Eric","B\u00e9zieau, St\u00e9phane","Stephanie Van Biervliet","S\u00e9bastien K\u00fcry","Ruth De Bruyne","Olivier M.
