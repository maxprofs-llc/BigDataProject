Electrodes and telemetry device were surgically implanted in four aged dogs (16-18 years old) and four young dogs (3-4 years old). Electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram (EMG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) were recorded simultaneously as parameters to determine vigilance states and an autonomic nervous function. Wakefulness, slow wave sleep (SWS) and paradoxical sleep (PS) were identified according to the EEG and EMG pattern. We also examined whether absolute powers and the low frequency-to-high frequency ratio (LF\/HF) derived from the heart rate variability power spectrum could detect shifts in autonomic balance correlated with aging. The aged dogs showed a marked reduction of PS and a fragmentation of wakefulness in the daytime and a sleep disruption in the night. The pattern of 24 h sleep and waking was dramatically altered in the aged dog. It was characterized by an increase in the total amount of time spent in SWS during the daytime followed by an increasing of time spent in wakefulness during the night. Furthermore, LF\/HF ratio showed a very low amplitude of variance throughout the day in the aged dog. These results suggest that the aged dog is a useful model to investigate sleep disorders in human such as daytime drowsiness, difficulties in sleep maintenance. The abnormality in sleep-wake cycle might be reflected by the altered autonomic balance in the aged dogs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023ad","authors":["Takeuchi, Takashi","Harada, Etsumori"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0166-4328(02)00123-7","first_seen_on":"2015-04-12T19:26:02+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["01664328","0166-4328"],"issue":"1","journal":"Behavioural Brain Research","last_mentioned_on":1427620252,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0166432802001237"],"pmid":"12385805","pubdate":"2002-10-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["brain","behavioralsciences"],"title":"Age-related changes in sleep-wake rhythm in dog ","type":"article","volume":"136","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/agerelated-changes-sleepwake-rhythm-dog"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4932759,"mean":5.8535623969412,"rank":4125521,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4932759,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":149825,"mean":9.9700812553398,"rank":125383,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":149825,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1746,"mean":3.5030785100287,"rank":1436,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1746,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":6.6644482758621,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
