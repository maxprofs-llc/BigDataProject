We evaluated the influence of gastrointestinal-mediated glucose disposal and incretin effect in patients with cirrhosis.\nNon-diabetic patients with Child Pugh A or B cirrhosis (n = 10) and matched healthy controls (n = 10) underwent a 50-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and an isoglycemic intravenous glucose infusion (IIGI). We presented data as median \u00b1 interquartile range and compared groups using non-parametric analysis of variance.\nPatients with cirrhosis were glucose intolerant compared to healthy controls (4 hour OGTTAUC : 609 \u00b1 458 vs. 180 \u00b1 155 min x mmol\/L; P = 0.005), insulin resistant (homeostatic model assessment (HOMAIR ): 3.7 \u00b1 4.9 vs. 2.6 \u00b1 1.4; P = 0.014) and had fasting hyperglucagonemia (8 \u00b1 3 vs. 3 \u00b1 4 pmol\/L; P = 0.027). Isoglycemia was achieved using 35 \u00b1 12 g of intravenous glucose in patients with cirrhosis compared to 24 \u00b1 10 g in healthy controls (P = 0.003). The gastrointestinal-mediated glucose disposal was markedly lower in patients with cirrhosis (30 \u00b1 23 vs. 52 \u00b1 20%; P = 0.003). Despite higher levels of the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) patients with cirrhosis had reduced incretin effect (35 \u00b1 44 vs. 55 \u00b1 30%; P = 0.008).\nImpaired gastrointestinal-mediated glucose disposal and reduced incretin effect may contribute to the glucose intolerance seen in patients with cirrhosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002db7","authors":["Junker, Anders E.","Gluud, Lise L.","Holst, Jens J.","Knop, Filip K.","Vilsb\u00f8ll, Tina","Junker, Anders E","Gluud, Lise L","Holst, Jens J","Knop, Filip K"],"doi":"10.1111\/jgh.12981","endpage":"1528","first_seen_on":"2015-04-14T16:22:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1440-1746"],"issue":"10","journal":"Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology","last_mentioned_on":1429077125,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jgh.12981\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jgh.12981\/abstract?utm_content=bufferfe0fc&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jgh.12981\/abstract?utm_content=buffer7ec62&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jgh.12981\/pdf","pmid":"25867498","pubdate":"2015-04-14T22:00:36+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1522","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Influence of gastrointestinal factors on glucose metabolism in patients with cirrhosis","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-gastrointestinal-factors-glucose-metabolism-patients-cirrhosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6394888,"mean":5.9820632261367,"rank":4492109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1669829,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6394888,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167378,"mean":9.7979572701149,"rank":112335,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":47057,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167378,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":791,"mean":2.7836886075949,"rank":425,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":346,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":791,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":3.3796875,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
