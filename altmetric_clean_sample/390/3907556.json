Mesenchymal and epithelial cell responses were compared to determine whether responses were cell type specific. Protein array analysis was used to further analyze key pathways identified by microarrays.\nDifferent wavelengths and energy densities produced unique sets of genes identified by microarray analysis. Pathway analysis pointed to TGF-beta 1 in the visible red and Akt 1 in the infrared wavelengths as key pathways to study. TGF-beta protein arrays suggested switching from canonical to non-canonical TGF-beta pathways with increases to longer IR wavelengths. Microarrays suggest RANKL and MMP 10 followed IR energy density dose-response curves. Epithelial and mesenchymal cells respond differently to stimulation by light suggesting cell type-specific response is possible.\nThese studies demonstrate differential gene expression with different wavelengths, energy densities and cell types. These differences in gene expression have the potential to be exploited for therapeutic purposes and can help explain contradictory results in the literature when wavelengths, energy densities and cell types differ.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f99","authors":["Guo, J.","Wang, Q.","Wai, D.","Zhang, Q.
