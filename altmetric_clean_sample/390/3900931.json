Blood, tissues, urine, and feces were collected at predetermined times. \u03b1-Cedrene concentrations were determined by a validated gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS\/MS). A gas chromatography-mass selective detection (GC-MSD) method was used to identify the major metabolite. After i.v. injection, \u03b1-cedrene exhibited a rapid clearance (98.4-120.3\u00a0ml\/min\/kg), a large distribution volume (35.9-56.5\u00a0l\/kg), and a relatively long half-life (4.0-6.4\u00a0h). Upon oral administration, it was slowly absorbed (Tmax\u00a0=\u00a04.4\u00a0h) with bioavailability of 48.7-84.8%. No gender differences were found in its pharmacokinetics. Upon oral administration, \u03b1-cedrene was highly distributed to tissues, with the tissue-to-plasma partition coefficients (Kp) far greater than unity for all tissues. In particular, its distribution to lipid was notably high (Kp\u00a0=\u00a0132.0) compared to other tissues. A mono-hydroxylated metabolite was identified as a preliminary metabolite in rat plasma. These results suggest that \u03b1-cedrene has the favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics to be further tested as an anti-obesity drug in clinical studies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9113cf058f61000cc81","authors":["Kim, Tae Hwan","Yoo, Sun Dong","Lee, Hye Suk","Lee, Kyoung Mee","Seok, Su Hyun","Kim, Min Gi","Jung, Byung Hwa","Kim, Min Gyu","Shin, Beom Soo"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.dmpk.2014.12.003","first_seen_on":"2015-04-12T17:47:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1880-0920"],"issue":"2","journal":"Drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics","last_mentioned_on":1428860803,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25857232?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25857232","pubdate":"2015-04-12T22:05:13+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["metabolism","pharmacology"],"title":"In\u00a0vivo absorption and disposition of \u03b1-cedrene, a sesquiterpene constituent of cedarwood oil, in female and male rats.","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vivo-absorption-disposition-cedrene-sesquiterpene-constituent-cedarwood-oil-female-male-rats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4986430,"mean":5.8992042329313,"rank":4168935,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4986430,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150697,"mean":9.974031042629,"rank":126207,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150697,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93,"mean":1.7413043478261,"rank":77,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
