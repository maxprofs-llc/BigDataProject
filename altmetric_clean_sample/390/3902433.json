Variations in synthesis conditions such as pH, temperature, reduction, and the stabilizing agent used will determine the morphology, size, monodispersity, and stability of nanoparticles obtained, allowing for modulation of their physical and chemical properties. Although many studies have been made about the synthesis and characterization of individual nanosystems of interest, to our knowledge the common, general traits that all those synthesis share have not been previously compiled. In this review, we aim to offer a global vision of some of the most relevant synthetic procedures reported up to date, with a special focus on nonfunctionalized gold nanoparticle synthetic routes in aqueous media, and to display a broad overview of the influence that synthesis conditions have on the shape, stability, and reactivity of nanoparticle systems.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Jimenez\u2010Ruiz, Aila","Perez\u2010Tejeda, Pilar","Grueso, Elia","Castillo, Paula M.","Prado\u2010Gotor, Rafael","Jimenez-Ruiz, Aila","Perez-Tejeda, Pilar","Castillo, Paula M","Prado-Gotor, Rafael"],"doi":"10.1002\/chem.201405117","endpage":"9609","first_seen_on":"2015-04-13T09:55:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3765"],"issue":"27","journal":"Chemistry - A European Journal","last_mentioned_on":1429087371,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201405117\/abstract;jsessionid=F797BE32FB35CBFD4B3CACCDDE152867.f04t01","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201405117\/abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/chem.201405117"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201405117\/pdf","pmid":"25867678","pubdate":"2015-04-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"9596","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Nonfunctionalized Gold Nanoparticles: Synthetic Routes and Synthesis Condition Dependence","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nonfunctionalized-gold-nanoparticles-synthetic-routes-synthesis-condition-dependence"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6362789,"mean":5.9834047477304,"rank":4472524,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1659216,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6362789,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161834,"mean":9.9156533957846,"rank":107937,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":46218,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161834,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2804,"mean":3.6688148412415,"rank":1545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":1191,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2804,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150,"mean":3.3783087248322,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":71,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
