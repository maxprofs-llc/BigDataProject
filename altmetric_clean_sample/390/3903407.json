The inner membrane transporter AcrB is a homotrimer, energized by the proton movement down the transmembrane electrochemical gradient. The asymmetric crystal structures of AcrB with three monomers in distinct conformational states [access (A), binding (B) and extrusion (E)] support a functional rotating mechanism, in which each monomer of AcrB cycles among the three states in a concerted way. However, the relationship between the conformational changes during functional rotation and drug translocation has not been totally understood. Here, we explored the conformational changes of the AcrB homotrimer during the ABE to BEA transition in different substrate-binding states using targeted MD simulations. It was found that the dissociation of substrate from the distal binding pocket of B monomer is closely related to the concerted conformational changes in the translocation pathway, especially the side chain reorientation of Phe628 and Tyr327. A second substrate binding at the proximal binding pocket of A monomer evidently accelerates the conformational transitions as well as substrate dissociation in B monomer. The acceleration effect of the multi-substrate binding mode provides a molecular explanation for the positive cooperativity observed in the kinetic studies of substrate efflux and deepens our understanding of the functional rotating mechanism of AcrB.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc10","authors":["Wang, Beibei","Weng, Jingwei","Wang, Wenning"],"doi":"10.3389\/fmicb.2015.00302","first_seen_on":"2015-04-13T15:38:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1664-302X"],"journal":"Frontiers in Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1429012359,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fmicb.2015.00302\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fmicb.2015.00302\/pdf","pmid":"25918513","pubdate":"2015-03-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Substrate binding accelerates the conformational transitions and substrate dissociation in multidrug efflux transporter AcrB","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/substrate-binding-accelerates-conformational-transitions-substrate-dissociation-multidrug-efflux-tra"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4995465,"mean":5.9123221894921,"rank":3332177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1462003,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4995465,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150926,"mean":9.982906648998,"rank":103548,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":40274,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150926,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3473,"mean":3.1768150921659,"rank":2052,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1168,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3473,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":311,"mean":3.3421677419355,"rank":213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":73,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":311,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
