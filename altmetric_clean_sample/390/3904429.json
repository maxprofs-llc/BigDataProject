Levels of research funding were compared to burden of disease measures, including prevalence, disability adjusted life years and economic burden.\nThe combined research funding into cancer, CHD, dementia and stroke by governmental and charity organisations in 2012 was \u00a3856 million, of which \u00a3544 million (64%) was devoted to cancer, \u00a3166 million (19%) to CHD, \u00a390 million (11%) to dementia and \u00a356 million (7%) to stroke. For every \u00a310 of health and social care costs attributable to each disease, cancer received \u00a31.08 in research funding, CHD \u00a30.65, stroke \u00a30.19 and dementia \u00a30.08. A considerable shift in the distribution of government research funding was observed between 2008 and 2012. In 2008, 66% of governmental research funding into the four conditions under study was devoted to cancer, 21% to CHD, 9% to dementia and 4% to stroke. In 2012, the proportions devoted to dementia and stroke had increased to 21% and 12%, respectively, with cancer accounting for 45% of total research spend.\nAlthough there has been much progress by government to increase levels of research funding for dementia and stroke, these areas remain underfunded when compared with the burden of disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cc0","authors":["Ramon Luengo-Fernandez","Jose Leal","Alastair Gray"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmjopen-2014-006648","first_seen_on":"2015-04-13T22:55:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2044-6055"],"issue":"4","journal":"BMJ Open","last_mentioned_on":1485335020,"links":["http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/lookup\/doi\/10.1136\/bmjopen-2014-006648","http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/5\/4\/e006648","http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/5\/4\/e006648.short?g=w_open_current_tab","http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/5\/4\/e006648.full","http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/5\/4\/e006648.long","http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/5\/4\/e006648?cpetoc=","http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/5\/4\/e006648.abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/bmjopen-2014-006648","http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/5\/4\/e006648.full?sid=216cb451-6229-4f6e-9ac2-101942c6ff5e","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25869683","http:\/\/m.bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/5\/4\/e006648","http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/5\/4\/e006648.full.pdf%20html"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/5\/4\/e006648.full.pdf","pmid":"25869683","pubdate":"2015-04-15T22:01:58+00:00","title":"UK research spend in 2008 and 2012: comparing stroke, cancer, coronary heart disease and dementia","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/uk-research-spend-2008-2012-comparing-stroke-cancer-coronary-heart-disease-dementia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":90.534,"score_history":{"1y":3.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":90.534},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8348397,"mean":7.0409473841366,"rank":96518,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":8251957,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8348397,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":204083,"mean":9.2786013073177,"rank":3548,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":200535,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":204083,"percentile":98},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6188,"mean":17.015879101342,"rank":201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":5987,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6188,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262,"mean":18.314022988506,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":250,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":23,"researcher":8,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":23,"Scientists":8,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
