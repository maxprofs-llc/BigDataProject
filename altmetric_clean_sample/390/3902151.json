Many strains produce the yellow pigment toxoflavin, which is highly toxic to plants, fungi, animals, and microorganisms. Although there have been several studies on the toxoflavin biosynthesis system of B. glumae, it is still unclear how B. gladioli activates toxoflavin biosynthesis. In this study, we explored the genomic organization of the toxoflavin system of B. gladioli and its biological functions using comparative genomic analysis between toxoflavin-producing strains (B. glumae BGR1 and B. gladioli BSR3) and a strain not producing toxoflavin (B. gladioli KACC11889). The latter exhibits normal physiological characteristics like other B. gladioli strains do. B. gladioli KACC11889 has all the genes involved in toxoflavin biosynthesis but lacks the quorum-sensing (QS) system that functions as an on\/off switch for toxoflavin biosynthesis. These data suggest that B. gladioli has evolved to use the QS signalling cascade of toxoflavin production (TofI\/TofR of QS \u2192 ToxJ or ToxR \u2192 tox operons) similar to the one in B. glumae. However, some strains may have evolved to eliminate toxoflavin production through deletion of the QS genes. In addition, we demonstrated that the toxoflavin biosynthetic system enhanced the virulence of B. gladioli. These findings provide another line of evidence supporting the differential regulation of the toxoflavin system in Burkholderia strains.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5083cf058f61000311b","authors":["Lee, Jongyun","Park, Jungwook","Kim, Sunyoung","Park, Inmyoung","Seo, Young\u2010Su","Seo, Young-Su"],"doi":"10.1111\/mpp.12262","endpage":"76","first_seen_on":"2015-04-13T07:26:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1364-3703"],"issue":"1","journal":"Molecular Plant Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1453405975,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/mpp.12262\/abstract;jsessionid=7B20BA28F731B72E39F869EF78E54CAC.f03t02","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/mpp.12262\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/mpp.12262\/abstract?platform=hootsuite"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/mpp.12262\/pdf","pmid":"25845410","pubdate":"2015-05-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"65","subjects":["molecularbiology","botany"],"title":"Differential regulation of toxoflavin production and its role in the enhanced virulence of Burkholderia gladioli","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/differential-regulation-toxoflavin-production-role-enhanced-virulence-burkholderia-gladioli"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7003089,"mean":6.2578197435162,"rank":3464425,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2029256,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7003089,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196197,"mean":8.9696405431305,"rank":105651,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":70759,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196197,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":734,"mean":4.5497080491132,"rank":539,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":109,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":734,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":4.34055,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
