Herpetiform lesions as well as asymptomatic shedding of virus in bodily secretions from macaques pose a risk to animal handlers and laboratory workers. Fatal encephalitis in humans infected with B virus has occurred. Dermatologists may become involved in the initial evaluation of animal handlers exposed to this virus through bites or infectious secretions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006af6","authors":["Benson, P M","Malane, S L","Banks, R","Hicks, C B","Hilliard, J","P.
