Probably originating with the Assyrians and Babylonians, it was used systematically by the Persians in the 6th century BC. Alexander the Great brought it from there to the eastern Mediterranean countries in the 4th century BC, and the Phoenicians introduced it to Rome in the 3rd century BC. It was virtually never used in pre-Hellenic Greece. The Romans perfected crucifion for 500 years until it was abolished by Constantine I in the 4th century AD. Crucifixion in Roman times was applied mostly to slaves, disgraced soldiers, Christians and foreigners--only very rarely to Roman citizens. Death, usually after 6 hours--4 days, was due to multifactorial pathology: after-effects of compulsory scourging and maiming, haemorrhage and dehydration causing hypovolaemic shock and pain, but the most important factor was progressive asphyxia caused by impairment of respiratory movement. Resultant anoxaemia exaggerated hypovolaemic shock. Death was probably commonly precipitated by cardiac arrest, caused by vasovagal reflexes, initiated inter alia by severe anoxaemia, severe pain, body blows and breaking of the large bones. The attending Roman guards could only leave the site after the victim had died, and were known to precipitate death by means of deliberate fracturing of the tibia and\/or fibula, spear stab wounds into the heart, sharp blows to the front of the chest, or a smoking fire built at the foot of the cross to asphyxiate the victim.","abstract_source":"pubmed","authors":["Retief FP","Cilliers L"],"first_seen_on":"2012-10-12T19:55:46+00:00","issns":["0256-9574"],"issue":"12","last_mentioned_on":1505108437,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14750495","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14750495","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/14750495\/"],"pmid":"14750495","pubdate":"2004-01-31T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"The history and pathology of crucifixion.","type":"article","volume":"93","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/history-pathology-crucifixion"},"altmetric_score":{"score":23.136,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":4,"3m":3,"1m":2,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":23.136},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":10},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":10}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
