The prevalence of strains harboring these mutations varies throughout the United States and the world. We examined T. pallidum strains circulating in Seattle, Washington, from 2001 to 2010 to determine the prevalence of 2 mutations associated with macrolide resistance and to determine whether these mutations were associated with certain T. pallidum strain types.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f610003524","doi":"10.1097\/olq.0b013e31826ae7a8","first_seen_on":"2012-10-11T14:27:01+00:00","funders":["niaid"],"issns":["0148-5717"],"issue":"","journal":"Sexually Transmitted Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1424314691,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/stdjournal\/9000\/00000\/Two_Mutations_Associated_With_Macrolide_Resistance.98755.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/23191949\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/stdjournal\/9000\/00000\/Two_Mutations_Associated_With_Macrolide_Resistance.98755.pdf","pmid":"23191949","pubdate":"2012-10-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"","subjects":["sexuallytransmitteddiseases"],"title":"Two Mutations Associated With Macrolide Resistance in Treponema pallidum: Increasing Prevalence and Correlation With Molecular Strain Type in Seattle, Washington.","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/two-mutations-associated-macrolide-resistance-treponema-pallidum-increasing-prevalence-correlation-m"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4782626,"mean":5.7258040009438,"rank":3199638,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1394267,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4782626,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81725,"mean":5.7546963437913,"rank":49905,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":28226,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81725,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":736,"mean":3.5297741496599,"rank":556,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":156,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":736,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":15.00125,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
