Altered intestinal bacterial flora and gut-associated endotoxemia are increasingly recognized as critical components in both nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Probiotics have been proposed in the treatment and prevention of many conditions, including the liver diseases. Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when consumed in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit to the host. There are many mechanisms by which probiotics enhance intestinal health and influence the gut-liver axis, including modulation of the intestinal microflora, modification of intestinal barrier function, and immunomodulation. The present review summarizes the recent studies highlighting the role of the intestinal microflora in the development of NAFLD and ALD and the potential efficacy of probiotics as a therapeutic strategy for liver diseases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e94","authors":["Kirpich IA","McClain CJ"],"first_seen_on":"2012-10-09T06:28:38+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"1","journal":"The Journal of the American College of Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1352200440,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22661622"],"pmid":"22661622","pubdate":"2012-06-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Probiotics in the treatment of the liver diseases.","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/probiotics-treatment-liver-diseases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":817947,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":3683627,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80365,"mean":5.495210840675,"rank":14839,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":65408,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80365,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":709,"mean":7.9082824858757,"rank":203,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":506,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":709,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":3.4,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
