Several methods have been developed to detect circulating tumor cells. The number of CTCs in NSCLC is lower than in other solid tumors. To date, trials are ongoing for a better understanding of CTCs. Besides association with prognosis, CTCs can be used to assess the efficacy of treatment and they are important substrates for molecular profiling of the tumor..","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa67d3cf058f61000981b","authors":["Rogier Boshuizen","Peter Kuhn","Michel van den Heuvel"],"doi":"10.3978\/j.issn.2072-1439.2012.08.21","first_seen_on":"2012-10-11T14:12:25+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["2077-6624","2072-1439"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Thoracic Disease","last_mentioned_on":1479820104,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23050106?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3461060\/"],"pmid":"23050106","pubdate":"2012-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"AME Publications","startpage":"456","title":"Circulating tumor cells in non-small cell lung carcinoma.","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/circulating-tumor-cells-nonsmall-cell-lung-carcinoma-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7724913,"mean":6.6254088328702,"rank":3780020,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3747326,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7724913,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101762,"mean":5.7723808138678,"rank":45386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":53288,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101762,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":505,"mean":2.3812103174603,"rank":129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":360,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":505,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.21875,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
