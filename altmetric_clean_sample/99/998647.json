Mothers of PT infants (n = 95) were all pump dependent; mothers of TM infants (n = 98) were all feeding their infant at breast. Mothers of nonnursing PT infants produced less milk over time compared to mothers of TM infants. A higher proportion of PT mothers had lower basal PRL levels compared with TM mothers. PRL and frequency of breast stimulation combined positively influenced milk production in PT mothers. OT levels were higher in PT versus TM mothers, but OT was not related to milk production. Further study is warranted regarding interventions to enhance milk production, particularly in pump-dependent mothers of PT infants.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023db","authors":["Hill PD","Aldag JC","Demirtas H","Naeem V","Parker NP","Zinaman MJ","Chatterton RT Jr"],"doi":"10.1177\/1099800409331394","first_seen_on":"2012-10-12T18:45:42+00:00","issns":["1099-8004"],"issue":"4","journal":"Biological Research for Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1418518446,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19224938"],"pmid":"19224938","pubdate":"2009-02-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing","medicine"],"title":"Association of serum prolactin and oxytocin with milk production in mothers of preterm and term infants.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-serum-prolactin-oxytocin-milk-production-mothers-preterm-term-infants-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4714189,"mean":5.6961538822827,"rank":2038426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":2612195,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4714189,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81566,"mean":5.7413313063201,"rank":29188,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":51199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81566,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175,"mean":2.5979310344828,"rank":54,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.83571428571429,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":2,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Professor":3,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Neuroscience":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":6}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Association of serum prolactin and oxytocin with milk production in... - PubMed - NCBI","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/1819187766\/posts\/10202149844267128","license":"public","citation_ids":[998647],"posted_on":"2014-12-14T00:54:06+00:00","summary":"important read www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov","author":{"name":"Debbie Coleman","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/1819187766","facebook_wall_name":false,"image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/1819187766\/picture","id_on_source":"1819187766"}},{"title":"Association of serum prolactin and oxytocin with milk production in... - PubMed - NCBI","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/100000191685336\/posts\/1573765362834986","license":"public","citation_ids":[998647],"posted_on":"2014-12-12T20:31:45+00:00","summary":"Regarding Oxytocin ( Pitcocin) and milk....
