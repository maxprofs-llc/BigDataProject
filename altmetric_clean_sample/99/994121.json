The aim was to develop an effective VI scale for assessing individual awareness and 'vestedness' relevant to disaster preparedness. Typical preparedness behaviours are discussed with emphasis on earthquakes and tornados in particular. Brief overviews of VI and the EPPM are offered, and findings are presented from three studies (one dealing with earthquakes, and two with tornados) conducted to determine the factor structure of the key VI components involved, and to develop and test subscales derived from the two theories. The paper finishes with a discussion of future research needs and suggestions on how the new subscales may be applied in the design and execution of more effective disaster preparedness campaigns.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002711","authors":["Miller, Claude H.","Adame, Bradley J.","Moore, Scott D."],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1467-7717.2012.01290.x","endpage":"27","first_seen_on":"2012-10-10T22:05:46+00:00","issns":["1467-7717","0361-3666"],"issue":"1","journal":"Disasters","last_mentioned_on":1349875683,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111%2Fj.1467-7717.2012.01290.x&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1467-7717.2012.01290.x\/pdf","pmid":"23050780","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Earth and Planetary Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["disastermedicine"],"title":"Vested Interest theory and disaster preparedness","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vested-interest-theory-disaster-preparedness"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631167,"mean":4.9271322908448,"rank":2898576,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":80556,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631167,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76761,"mean":5.1877578165711,"rank":56934,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":449,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76761,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":223,"mean":2.8922792792793,"rank":186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":223,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":5.35,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
