Depending on the hydration characteristics of each counteranion, the selective swelling of the block copolymer lamellar structures leads to large tunability of the photonic stop band from blue to red wavelengths. More extensive quaternization of the P2VP block allows the photonic lamellar gels to swell more and red shift to longer wavelength. Here, we investigate the dynamic swelling behavior in the photonic gel films through time-resolved in situ measurement of UV-vis transmission. We model the swelling behavior using the transfer matrix method based on the experimentally observed reflectivity data with substitution of appropriate counterions. These tunable structural color materials may be attractive for numerous applications such as high-contrast displays without using a backlight, color filters, and optical mirrors for flexible lasing.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006816","authors":["Ho Sun Lim"],"doi":"10.1021\/nn302949n","first_seen_on":"2012-10-10T19:30:23+00:00","issns":["1936-0851"],"journal":"ACS Nano","last_mentioned_on":1350904008,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/nn302949n"],"pmid":"23020142","pubdate":"2012-10-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Dynamic Swelling of Tunable Full-Color Block Copolymer Photonic Gels via Counterion Exchange","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dynamic-swelling-tunable-fullcolor-block-copolymer-photonic-gels-via-counterion-exchange"},"altmetric_score":{"score":22.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":22.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":155564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":4351403,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80290,"mean":5.5244557037702,"rank":3209,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":77068,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80290,"percentile":95},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3519,"mean":8.6596418419556,"rank":304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":3215,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3519,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143,"mean":9.5731267605634,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":130,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
