Physiologic changes occur in the skin as humans mature from infancy to adulthood. Thus, characterizations of adult microbiomes might have limitations when considering pediatric disorders such as atopic dermatitis (AD) or issues such as sites of microbial carriage. The objective of this study was to determine if microbial communities at several body sites in children differed significantly from adults.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000823","authors":["Oh J","Conlan S","Polley E","Segre JA","Kong HH"],"doi":"10.1186\/gm378","first_seen_on":"2012-10-10T19:59:58+00:00","issns":["","1756-994X"],"issue":"10","journal":"Genome Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1390925807,"links":["http:\/\/genomemedicine.com\/content\/4\/10\/77\/abstract"],"pmid":"23050952","pubdate":"2012-10-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Bioinformatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Genetics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Proteomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"77","title":"Shifts in human skin and nares microbiota of healthy children and adults","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/shifts-human-skin-nares-microbiota-healthy-children-adults"},"altmetric_score":{"score":20.08,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":20.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6561235,"mean":6.0788887803725,"rank":302301,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":6258843,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6561235,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89178,"mean":5.9179097749419,"rank":4317,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":84861,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89178,"percentile":95},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":620,"mean":18.224326332795,"rank":102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":518,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":620,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":5.2158333333333,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":5,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":26,"Student  > Ph.
