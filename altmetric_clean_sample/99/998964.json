In the cardiomyocyte, ranolazine inhibits depolarizing Na(+) current and delayed rectifier (I(Kr)) currents. Recently, ranolazine was also shown to be an inhibitor of Na(V)1.5 mechanosensitivity. Stretch also accelerates the firing frequency of the SA node, and fluid shear stress increases the beating rate of cultured cardiomyocytes in vitro. However, no cultured cell platform exists currently for examination of spontaneous electrical activity in response to mechanical stimulation. In the present study, flow of solution over atrial myocyte-derived HL-1 cultured cells was used to study shear stress mechanosensitivity of Na(+) current and spontaneous, endogenous rhythmic action potentials. In voltage-clamped HL-1 cells, bath flow increased peak Na(+) current by 14 \u00b1 5%. In current-clamped cells, bath flow increased the frequency and decay rate of AP by 27 \u00b1 12% and 18 \u00b1 4%, respectively. Ranolazine blocked both responses to shear stress. This study suggests that cultured HL-1 cells are a viable in vitro model for detailed study of the effects of mechanical stimulation on spontaneous cardiac action potentials. Inhibition of the frequency and decay rate of action potentials in HL-1 cells are potential mechanisms behind the antiarrhythmic effect of ranolazine.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024da","authors":["Strege P","Beyder A","Bernard C","Crespo-Diaz R","Behfar A","Terzic A","Ackerman M","Farrugia G"],"first_seen_on":"2012-10-12T21:28:48+00:00","funders":["phs","nigms"],"issns":[],"issue":"6","journal":"Channels","last_mentioned_on":1349301714,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23018927"],"pmid":"23018927","pubdate":"2012-09-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Ranolazine inhibits shear sensitivity of endogenous Na (+) current and spontaneous action potentials in HL-1 cells.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ranolazine-inhibits-shear-sensitivity-endogenous-na-current-spontaneous-action-potentials-hl1-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630978,"mean":4.9279868812221,"rank":2898980,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":80167,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630978,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76912,"mean":5.1837015771476,"rank":57079,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":445,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76912,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99,"mean":1.5463673469388,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
