There is ongoing research on identifying factors that have an impact on quality of life in this particular group of patients. A great variety of factors affecting quality of life and lack of information on their importance encouraged us to perform a systematic literature review analyzing quality of life of patients who sustained femoral neck fracture. The search was performed in the PubMed and Medline databases according to the selected key words. In our systematic review, we included clinical and clinical randomized trials investigating patients with femoral neck fracture and their quality of life. Our analysis showed that treatment of femoral neck fracture with hip replacement was superior to osteosynthesis with regard to patients' quality of life. The data regarding the impact of different rehabilitation programs on quality of life were controversial; a few reports showed that special rehabilitation programs were associated with better health-related quality life. However, other studies did not report any differences in patients' quality of life when different rehabilitation programs were applied. Patient's nutrition may be an important factor affecting the quality of life in patients with femoral neck fractures; however, data supporting this fact are insufficient.","abstract_source":"pubmed","authors":["Valavi\u010dien\u0117 R","Smailys A","Macijauskien\u0117 J","Hommel A"],"first_seen_on":"2012-10-10T23:27:12+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"12","journal":"Medicina (Buenos Aires)","last_mentioned_on":1349863889,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21532283?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"21532283","pubdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Factors affecting health-related quality of life in patients after femoral neck fracture.","type":"article","volume":"46","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/factors-affecting-healthrelated-quality-life-patients-after-femoral-neck-fracture"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634284,"mean":4.9206846148246,"rank":2897596,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":82687,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634284,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76776,"mean":5.1799366460436,"rank":56891,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":489,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76776,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":203,"mean":1.3589801980198,"rank":126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":203,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.325,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
