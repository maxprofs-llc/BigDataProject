We sought to directly measure the occurrence of autism traits in a cohort of individuals with AgCC and to investigate the neural underpinnings of this association. We screened a large AgCC cohort (n\u00a0=\u00a0106) with the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) and found that 45\u00a0% of children, 35\u00a0% of adolescents, and 18\u00a0% of adults exceeded the predetermined autism-screening cut-off. Interestingly, performance on the AQ's imagination domain was inversely correlated with magnetoencephalography measures of resting-state functional connectivity in the right superior temporal gyrus. Individuals with AgCC should be screened for ASD and disorders of the corpus callosum should be considered in autism diagnostic evaluations as well.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cb4","authors":["Lau YC","Hinkley LB","Bukshpun P","Strominger ZA","Wakahiro ML","Baron-Cohen S","Allison C","Auyeung B","Jeremy RJ","Nagarajan SS","Sherr EH","Marco EJ","Yolanda C.
