The prevalence rate of Tourette's syndrome was around 0.56%. The ratio of male to female was 9 to 2. The comorbid rate of attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder was 36%, self-injurious behaviors 27%, and obsessive-compulsive behaviors 18%. The familial rate of Tourette's syndrome was 27%. We also found that another 98 children had transient tic disorders. For 73% of patients with mild tics, understanding and acceptance from family, teachers, and friends are the most important things. When tics are so severe that medication is necessary, haloperidol is no longer the first or only choice. We tried clonidine, atypical neuroleptics such as risperidone or olanzapine, or pergolide. The first support group was established in 1999 for children with tics in Taiwan and transformed to Taiwan Tourette Family association in June 2001 to provide further service for Tourette's syndrome.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002425","authors":["Wang HS","Kuo MF"],"first_seen_on":"2012-10-10T23:32:37+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Brain & Development","last_mentioned_on":1349862685,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14980369"],"pmid":"14980369","pubdate":"2004-02-27T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["brain","pediatrics"],"title":"Tourette's syndrome in Taiwan: an epidemiological study of tic disorders in an elementary school at Taipei County.","type":"article","volume":"25 Suppl 1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tourettes-syndrome-taiwan-epidemiological-study-tic-disorders-elementary-school-taipei-county"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629536,"mean":4.93415564694,"rank":2016100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":939816,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629536,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76744,"mean":5.1933724769686,"rank":36828,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":27075,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76744,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":265,"mean":2.0598106060606,"rank":143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":70,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":265,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.4714285714286,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
