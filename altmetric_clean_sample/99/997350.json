In cases of severe deficits in memory or motor function, hospitalization and\/or custodial care would be a likely outcome. This means that unless some way is found to reduce these age-related decrements in neuronal function, health care costs will continue to rise exponentially. Evidence is accumulating that consumption of blueberries may be one strategy to forestall or even reverse age-related neuronal deficits, as well as their subsequent behavioral manifestations, in order to increase healthy aging. Research suggests that the polyphenolic compounds found in blueberries exert their beneficial effects either through their ability to lower oxidative stress and inflammation or directly by altering the signaling involved in neuronal communication. These interventions, in turn, may protect against age-related deficits in cognitive and motor function. Appropriately, the US Department of Agriculture has figured prominently in these discoveries, through the efforts of two USDA researchers who worked for the department 100 years apart.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f61000296e","authors":["Shukitt-Hale B","Shukitt-Hale, B."],"doi":"10.1159\/000341101","endpage":"523","first_seen_on":"2012-10-12T06:24:19+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["0304-324X","1423-0003"],"issue":"6","journal":"Gerontology","last_mentioned_on":1473081361,"links":["http:\/\/content.karger.com\/ProdukteDB\/produkte.asp?doi=10.1159\/000341101","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22907211","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1159\/000341101","http:\/\/www.karger.com\/Article\/Abstract\/341101","http:\/\/content.karger.com\/ProdukteDB\/produkte.asp?Doi=341101"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/content.karger.com\/ProdukteDB\/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowPDF\r\n\t\t\tdocument.images[button].src = oldSrc.substring(0, oldSrc.length - 5) + state + ","pmid":"22907211","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Karger Publishers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"518","subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Blueberries and Neuronal Aging.","type":"article","volume":"58","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/blueberries-neuronal-aging"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.43,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.43},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8331095,"mean":7.02255168024,"rank":640198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7690857,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8331095,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104929,"mean":5.9918764295517,"rank":7946,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":96980,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104929,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":407,"mean":7.1820295566502,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":356,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":407,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":3.51475,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"practitioner":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
