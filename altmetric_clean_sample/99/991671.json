This study was conducted on 25 adult chronic periodontitis sufferers who were patients in Rajah Muthiah Dental College and Hospital, Annamalai University. The levels of TBARS and non-enzymatic antioxidants, and the activities of enzymatic antioxidants in the patients' plasma, erythrocytes and gingival tissues were assayed using specific colorimetric methods. The periodontitis sufferers had a significantly higher TBARS level than the healthy subjects. In the plasma, erythrocytes, erythrocyte membranes and gingival tissues of the periodontitis sufferers, enzymatic antioxidant activities were found to be significantly higher, whereas the levels of non-enzymatic antioxidants were significantly lower (except for reduced glutathione in the gingival tissues) relative to the parameters found for healthy subjects. The disturbance in the endogenous antioxidant defense system due to over-production of lipid peroxidation products at inflammatory sites can be related to a higher level of oxidative stress in patients with periodontitis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e23","authors":["Panjamurthy K","Manoharan S","Ramachandran CR"],"first_seen_on":"2012-10-09T15:07:51+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Cellular & Molecular Biology Letters","last_mentioned_on":1359414063,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16010291"],"pmid":"16010291","pubdate":"2004-12-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"Lipid peroxidation and antioxidant status in patients with periodontitis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lipid-peroxidation-antioxidant-status-patients-periodontitis-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628824,"mean":4.9380564480592,"rank":2698825,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":885021,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628824,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76820,"mean":5.1889390645544,"rank":49795,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":25221,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76820,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":1.8113076923077,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
