Forty-nine percent of patients did not want their HIV status routinely documented in hospital notes and 57% did not want hospital staff to have access to results of sexual health screens (SHSs). In light of these results, we plan to offer patients the option to opt out of using hospital notes for documentation of their HIV care and will be providing SHSs under a separate genitourinary medicine (GU) patient number.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006615","authors":["Warwick Z","Lillicrap R"],"doi":"10.1258\/ijsa.2012.011423","first_seen_on":"2012-10-13T05:10:34+00:00","issns":["0956-4624"],"issue":"9","journal":"International Journal of STD & AIDS","last_mentioned_on":1350105025,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23033519"],"pmid":"23033519","pubdate":"2012-10-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome"],"title":"What do HIV-positive patients in Plymouth think about sharing details of their HIV status with other health-care workers?","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hivpositive-patients-plymouth-think-about-sharing-details-hiv-status-other-healthcare-workers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":4204195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83516,"mean":5.784015566066,"rank":68783,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83516,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":809,"mean":2.1154455445545,"rank":779,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":809,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":2.2409090909091,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Business, Management and Accounting":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"US":1,"PT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HIV_Insight\/statuses\/256985218370637824","license":"public","citation_ids":[999282],"posted_on":"2012-10-13T05:10:25+00:00","author":{"name":"HIV Insight","url":"http:\/\/hiv-insight.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/587408973\/INSIGHT_ICON_normal.gif","description":"HIV, AIDS, STI, STD, HPV, Sexuality, LGBT, et al.
