This article reports on a 1-year-old immunocompetent boy with recurrent BCG osteomyelitis involving the distal tibia who presented with a limping gait from the beginning of toddling. The lesion was located in the metaphysis and crossed the growth plate to the epiphysis, causing concern for ambulation. After surgery, he was initiated on an individualized, intense rehabilitation program and achieved a good functional recovery. Rehabilitation programs with gait analyses provide effective therapeutic and monitoring methods for toddlers recovering from BCG osteomyelitis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dd5","authors":["Chen, Yen-Chun","Wen, Hsin-Chiao","Wei, Ta-Sen","Chen, Kuan-Lin","Yen-Chun Chen","Hsin-Chiao Wen","Ta-Sen Wei","Kuan-Lin Chen"],"doi":"10.1097\/bpb.0000000000000377","first_seen_on":"2016-08-15T02:07:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1473-5865","1060-152X"],"journal":"Journal of Pediatric Orthopaedics: Part B","last_mentioned_on":1502974846,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jpo-b\/9000\/00000\/Recurrent_Bacille_Calmette_Guerin_osteomyelitis.99154.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27509483?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jpo-b\/9000\/00000\/Recurrent_Bacille_Calmette_Guerin_osteomyelitis.99154.pdf","pmid":"27509483","pubdate":"2016-08-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["orthopedics","pediatrics"],"title":"Recurrent Bacille Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin osteomyelitis with ankle joint involvement in a toddler","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jpo-b\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Recurrent_Bacille_Calmette_Guerin_osteomyelitis.99154.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/recurrent-bacille-calmettegu%C3%A9rin-osteomyelitis-ankle-joint-involvement-toddler"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8389481,"mean":7.0670107241375,"rank":6066479,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2022754,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8389481,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257583,"mean":12.012439052418,"rank":165973,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":76094,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257583,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":750,"mean":0.88394926568758,"rank":147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":574,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":750,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":0.635,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JPediatricOrthB\/statuses\/765006849082953728","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10515142],"posted_on":"2016-08-15T02:07:00+00:00","author":{"name":"JPediatricOrtho_B","url":"http:\/\/www.jpo-b.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2898745011\/ae8e601522ca57ccb06f918381ec9b87_normal.jpeg","description":"Publishing peer-reviewed papers on the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric orthopedic disorders.","id_on_source":"JPediatricOrthB","tweeter_id":"972161594","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":230},"tweet_id":"765006849082953728"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MycobactPapers\/statuses\/898167720784605184","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10515142],"posted_on":"2017-08-17T13:00:46+00:00","author":{"name":"Mycobacterium Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/719097737984274432\/6xb8SSeZ_normal.jpg","description":"A daily collection of papers relating to Mycobacterium.
