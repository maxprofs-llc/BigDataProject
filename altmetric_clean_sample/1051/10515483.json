Lupus nephritis remains frequent and is still a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. In the past year unfortunately there were no new reproducible, biomarker studies to help direct therapy of renal disease. However, some progress was made in neuropsychiatric disease assessment, with a new and promising automated test to screen for cognitive dysfunction reported. There were no prospective interventional treatment trials designed for patients with cSLE published in the last year, but some studies involving children are currently active and might improve the therapeutic options for patients with cSLE.\nThere is a need to get a better understanding of pathogenesis and identify new biomarkers in cSLE to more accurately predict outcomes. New insights into characterization of different clinical manifestations may enable to optimize individual interventions and influence the prognosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000586d","authors":["Couture, Julie","Silverman, Earl D."],"doi":"10.1097\/bor.0000000000000317","endpage":"496","first_seen_on":"2016-08-15T02:51:38+00:00","issns":["1531-6963","1040-8711"],"issue":"5","journal":"Current opinion in rheumatology","last_mentioned_on":1471229483,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-rheumatology\/Abstract\/2016\/09000\/Update_on_the_pathogenesis_and_treatment_of.6.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/co-rheumatology\/2016\/09000\/Update_on_the_pathogenesis_and_treatment_of.6.pdf","pmid":"27341622","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"488","subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"Update on the pathogenesis and treatment of childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-rheumatology\/Fulltext\/2016\/09000\/Update_on_the_pathogenesis_and_treatment_of.6.aspx","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/update-pathogenesis-treatment-childhoodonset-systemic-lupus-erythematosus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8219010,"mean":6.9619102524339,"rank":6241300,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1106267,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8219010,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":255631,"mean":12.00914707194,"rank":181584,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":39859,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":255631,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":645,"mean":2.6433416149068,"rank":436,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":645,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":1.8916666666667,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":3,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":4,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":13,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CO_Rheumatology\/statuses\/765018017491144704","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10515483],"posted_on":"2016-08-15T02:51:23+00:00","author":{"name":"CO Rheumatology","url":"http:\/\/www.co-rheumatology.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1706280775\/BOR_square_cover_normal.jpg","description":"Provides powerful perspectives on the most important advances in published literature, delivering expert assessments of developments from the previous year.","id_on_source":"CO_Rheumatology","tweeter_id":"368372162","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":287},"tweet_id":"765018017491144704"}]}}
