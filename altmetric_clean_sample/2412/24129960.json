This strategy employs a Diels-Alder cycloaddition to assemble a fused bicyclic anhydride intermediate, which is elaborated to a vinyl lactone-acetal bearing an aromatic ring in five steps. Aromatic iodination is followed by magnesium-halogen exchange with a trialkyl magnesiate species, which undergoes intramolecular cyclization. Subsequent oxidation provides the desired 6-7-6 tricyclic diketoaldehyde, with carbonyl groups at all three positions for eventual C-N bond formation and subsequent elaboration.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003265","authors":["Jason J.
