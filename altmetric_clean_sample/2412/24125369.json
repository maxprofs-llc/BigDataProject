In Germany, approximately 9000 patients are treated in clinics for forensic psychiatry and psychotherapy on the basis of \u00a7\u00a063 of the StGB and in withdrawal centers on the basis of \u00a7\u00a064\u00a0StGB. The laws for treatment of patients in forensic commitment are passed by the individual States, with the result that even the basic conditions differ in the individual States. While minimum requirements have already been published for the preparation of expert opinions on liability and legal prognosis, consensus standards for the treatment in forensic psychiatry have not yet been published. Against this background, in 2014 the German Society for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Psychosomatics and Neurology (DGPPN) commissioned an interdisciplinary task force to develop professional standards for treatment in forensic psychiatry. Legal, ethical, structural, therapeutic and prognostic standards for forensic psychiatric treatment should be described according to the current state of science. After 3 years of work the results of the interdisciplinary working group were presented in early 2017 and approved by the board of the DGPPN. The standards for the treatment in the forensic psychiatric commitment aim to initiate a\u00a0discussion in order to standardize the treatment conditions and to establish evidence-based recommendations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f610003184","authors":["J.
