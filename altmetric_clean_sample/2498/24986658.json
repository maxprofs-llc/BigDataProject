In this study, we focused on the development of one critical executive function skill, that of inhibitory control. In a longitudinal study, we tested 96 children at 24, 30, 36, 50, and 60\u00a0months of age with age-appropriate measures of inhibition. We found evidence for the developmental stability of inhibitory abilities. Inhibitory control at 30\u00a0months of age was strongly related to inhibitory control at 60\u00a0months of age even when verbal IQ was partialled out. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Prior research has shown that executive functions play a key role in children's academic as well as social development. However, evidence on the stability of individual differences in executive functions, especially in preschool children, is sparse and contradictory. What the present study adds? The present work was designed to investigate the stability of one particular executive function, namely inhibitory control, over a relatively large period of time, from 24 to 60\u00a0months of age. The most important finding is a robust correlation between Reverse Categorization at 30\u00a0months and Simon Says at 60\u00a0months (r\u00a0=\u00a0.56). We argue that this further highlights the importance of early EF interventions due to a possible 'ripple effect'.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002443","authors":["Kloo, Daniela","Sodian, Beate"],"doi":"10.1111\/bjdp.12197","first_seen_on":"2017-09-09T03:35:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0261510X","2044-835X"],"journal":"British Journal of Developmental Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1504921620,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/bjdp.12197\/abstract;jsessionid=36381CDBD5B4AF0D19119EBF7B4529D6.f03t04"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/bjdp.12197\/pdf","pmid":"28792070","pubdate":"2017-08-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychology","pediatrics"],"title":"The developmental stability of inhibition from 2 to 5\u00a0years","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/developmental-stability-inhibition-2-5years"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.08,"score_history":{"1y":5.08,"6m":5.08,"3m":5.08,"1m":5.08,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8389481,"mean":7.0670107241375,"rank":1622332,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6745733,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8389481,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122614,"mean":11.878543955372,"rank":28554,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":93646,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122614,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":374,"mean":8.4917372654155,"rank":151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":216,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":374,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":6.6071428571429,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"The developmental stability of inhibition from 2 to 5\u00a0years","url":"http:\/\/ifp.nyu.edu\/2017\/journal-article-abstracts\/developmental-stability-inhibition-2-5-years\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[24986658],"posted_on":"2017-09-09T01:47:00+00:00","summary":"&hellip;\nFrom:\nThe developmental stability of inhibition from 2 to 5&nbsp;years\nThe post The developmental stability of inhibition from 2 to 5&nbsp;years was curated by information for practice.","author":{"name":"information for practice","url":"http:\/\/ifp.nyu.edu\/","description":"news, new scholarship &amp; more from around the world"}}]}}
