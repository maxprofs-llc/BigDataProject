Forty-six HD patients were assigned to receive 1 of 2 treatments: probiotic (n\u00a0=\u00a023; Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus e Bifidobacterialongum, 90 billion colony-forming units per day) or placebo (n\u00a0=\u00a023) daily for 3\u00a0months. Blood and feces were collected at baseline and after intervention. The inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and interleukin-6) were analyzed by immunoenzymatic assay (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Uremic toxins plasma levels (indoxyl sulfate, p-cresyl sulfate, and indole-3-acetic acid) were obtained by Reversed-Phase High-Performance Liquid Chromatography. Routine laboratory parameters were measured by standard techniques. Fecal pH was measured by the colorimetric method, and the gut microbiota profile was assessed by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis analysis.\nSixteen patients remained in the probiotic group (11 men, 53.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.0\u00a0year old, 25.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.6\u00a0kg\/m(2)) and 17 in the placebo group (10 men, 50.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.5\u00a0year old, 25.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.7\u00a0kg\/m(2)). After probiotic supplementation there was a significant increase in serum urea (from 149.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a034.2\u00a0mg\/dL to 172.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a045.0\u00a0mg\/dL, P\u00a0=\u00a0.02), potassium (from 4.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0mmol\/L to 4.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0mmol\/L, P\u00a0=\u00a0.02), and indoxyl sulfate (from 31.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.9 to 36.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.0\u00a0mg\/dL, P\u00a0=\u00a0.02). The fecal pH was reduced from 7.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8 to 6.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.01). These parameters did not change significantly in placebo group. Changes in the percentage delta (\u0394) between groups were exhibited with no statistical differences observed. The inflammatory markers and gut profile were not altered by supplementation.\nAprobiotic supplementation failed to reduce uremic toxins and inflammatory markers. Therefore, probiotic therapy should be chosen with caution in HD patients. Further studies addressing probiotic therapy in chronic kidney disease patients are needed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005aa1","authors":["Nat\u00e1lia A. Borges","Fl\u00e1via L.
