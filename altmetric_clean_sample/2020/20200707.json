The cause of AD is not yet completely defined and efforts to find a cure for it have so far been disappointing. AD is one of the most significant health care problems nationally and globally. Recently, we described a personalized therapeutic approach called metabolic enhancement for neurodegeneration (MEND) that successfully reversed the cognitive decline in patients with early AD. The magnitude of the improvement was exceptional, providing testimony to the fact that a personalized and programmatic approach to cognitive decline is highly effective. Ayurveda is a personalized system of traditional medicine native to India and the Indian subcontinent. Although a direct reference to AD in the ancient Ayurvedic literature is missing, concepts including forgetfulness, memory loss, and brain cell loss have been described. Using the clinical information and the metabolic profiling of AD individuals we recently reported using the MEND program, we now describe in this commentary, 3 subtypes of AD based on the Ayurvedic interpretation. Ayurvedic profiling of patients with AD reveals 3 readily distinguishable subtypes, namely Vata, Pitta, and Krimi, which will prove useful in patients with cognitive decline and those at risk for such decline from the standpoint of specific subtype-based Ayurvedic intervention.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51a3cf058f61000387c","authors":["Bredesen, Dale E","Rao, Rammohan V"],"first_seen_on":"2017-05-17T00:31:37+00:00","issns":["1078-6791"],"journal":"Alternative Therapies in Health & Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1494979644,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28236613"],"pmid":"28236613","pubdate":"2017-02-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"Ayurvedic Profiling of Alzheimer's Disease.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ayurvedic-profiling-alzheimers-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8219010,"mean":6.9619102524339,"rank":4370113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2282112,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8219010,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233550,"mean":12.370934870198,"rank":129350,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":82289,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233550,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":378,"mean":8.482275862069,"rank":236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":378,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":5.32875,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Alzhacker\/statuses\/864633413868830720","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20200707],"posted_on":"2017-05-17T00:07:24+00:00","author":{"name":"\u30a2\u30eb\u30cf\u30ab","url":"http:\/\/alzhacker.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/899247328917307397\/GIiOvHHh_normal.jpg","description":"\u6bcd\u304c #\u82e5\u5e74\u6027\u30a2\u30eb\u30c4\u30cf\u30a4\u30de\u30fc \u3068\u8a3a\u65ad\u3055\u308c\u3066\uff18\u5e74\u304c\u7d4c\u904e\u3001MMSE23\u70b9\u3092\u7dad\u6301\u3002\u533b\u5b66\u7684\u6839\u62e0\u3092\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u56de\u5fa9\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002 #\u30a2\u30eb\u30c4\u30cf\u30a4\u30de\u30fc #\u8a8d\u77e5\u75c7 #\u8a8d\u77e5\u75c7\u4e88\u9632","id_on_source":"Alzhacker","tweeter_id":"823123029748158464","geo":{"lt":35.68536,"ln":139.75309,"country":"JP"},"followers":124},"tweet_id":"864633413868830720"}]}}
