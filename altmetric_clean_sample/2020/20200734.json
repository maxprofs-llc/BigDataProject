We recently produced an anti-bovine PDPN (bovPDPN) monoclonal antibody (mAb), PMab-44, by immunizing mice with recombinant proteins of bovPDPN. In this study, we determined the critical epitope of PMab-44 for the recognition of bovPDPN using many deletion mutants and point mutants of bovPDPN. Flow cytometric analyses revealed that the epitope of PMab-44 was Glu46-Thr50, which corresponds to platelet aggregation-stimulating (PLAG) domain-3. The important amino acids in the PMab-44 epitope were determined to be Glu46, Tyr48, and Thr50. Western blot analysis also confirmed these results, indicating that the PLAG domain of bovPDPN is also important in immunogenicity for producing useful anti-PDPN mAbs.","authors":["YamadaShinji","HonmaRyusuke","KanekoMika K.","NakamuraTakuro","YanakaMiyuki","SaidohNoriko","TakagiMichiaki","KonnaiSatoru","KatoYukinari"],"doi":"10.1089\/mab.2017.0016","first_seen_on":"2017-05-17T00:32:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2167-9436"],"journal":"Monoclonal Antibodies in Immunodiagnosis and Immunotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1494979856,"links":["http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/10.1089\/mab.2017.0016"],"pmid":"28498096","publisher":" Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.  140 Huguenot Street, 3rd Floor New Rochelle, NY 10801 USA  ","title":"Characterization of the Anti-Bovine Podoplanin Monoclonal Antibody PMab-44","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterization-antibovine-podoplanin-monoclonal-antibody-pmab44"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"JP":1},"mendeley":{"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ScienceCrisp\/statuses\/864634302079787008","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20200734],"posted_on":"2017-05-17T00:10:56+00:00","author":{"name":"CRISP_SCIENCE","url":"http:\/\/crisp-bio.blog.jp\/archives\/2333979.html","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/821173800033140736\/CZjz8zTU_normal.jpg","description":"\u9580\u524d\u306e\u5c0f\u50e7\u3001\u5927\u6d77\u306e\u4e00\u91dd\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080: CRISPR, structural biology, research resources,  ....","id_on_source":"ScienceCrisp","tweeter_id":"818008252814217217","geo":{"lt":35.6895,"ln":139.69171,"country":"JP"},"followers":96},"tweet_id":"864634302079787008"}]}}
