The real-time quantification of trace VOCs produced by cancer cells during peroxidative stress presents a new challenge to non-invasive clinical diagnostics, which we have met with some success, as described in this paper.\nA combination of selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS), a technique that allows rapid, reliable quantification of VOCs in humid air and liquid headspace, and electrochemistry to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vitro has been used. Thus, VOCs present in the headspace of CALU-1 cancer cell line cultures exposed to ROS have been monitored and quantified in real time using SIFT-MS.\nThe CALU-1 lung cancer cells were cultured in 3D collagen to mimic in vivo tissue. Real time SIFT-MS analyses focused on the volatile aldehydes, propanal, butanal, pentanal, hexanal, heptanal and malondialdehyde (propanedial), that are expected to be products of cellular membrane peroxidation. All six aldehydes were identified in the culture headspace, each reaching peak concentrations during the time of exposure to ROS and eventually reducing as the reactants were depleted in the culture. Pentanal and hexanal were the most abundant, reaching concentrations of a few hundred parts-per-billion by volume, ppbv, in the culture headspace.\nThe results of these experiments demonstrate that peroxidation of cancer cells in vitro can be monitored and evaluated by direct real time analysis of the volatile aldehydes produced. The combination of adopted methodology potentially has value for the study of other types of VOCs that may be produced by cellular damage.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f6100086ec","authors":["Shestivska, Violetta","Rutter, Abigail V.","Sul\u00e9\u2010Suso, Josep","Smith, David","Spanel, Patrik"],"doi":"10.1002\/rcm.7911","first_seen_on":"2017-05-28T19:12:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0951-4198","1097-0231","09514198"],"journal":"Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry","last_mentioned_on":1499893309,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/rcm.7911\/full","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/rcm.7911&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/rcm.7911\/pdf","pmid":"28556307","pubdate":"2017-05-31T22:04:52+00:00","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Earth Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Evaluation of peroxidative stress of cancer cells in vitro\n by real time quantification of volatile aldehydes in culture headspace","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":1.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8200876,"mean":6.9354244123888,"rank":3870590,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4147867,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8200876,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231659,"mean":12.118472558685,"rank":107244,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":117301,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231659,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1766,"mean":1.61851898017,"rank":467,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":1271,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1766,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":2.2935714285714,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/realBioMassSpec\/statuses\/868907810217656323","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20672023],"posted_on":"2017-05-28T19:12:20+00:00","author":{"name":"BioMassSpec","url":"http:\/\/www.bioanalytik.uni-saarland.de","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/848229419135025152\/bKtdj4OY_normal.jpg","description":"Dietrich Volmer \u00b7 Research in analytical chemistry, mass spectrometry and metabolomics \u00b7 Editor of Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry \u00b7 Views are my own","id_on_source":"realBioMassSpec","tweeter_id":"822468104806682627","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":382},"tweet_id":"868907810217656323"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/rcm_journal\/statuses\/885242817865547776","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20672023],"posted_on":"2017-07-12T21:01:49+00:00","author":{"name":"RCM","url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/journal\/10.1002\/(ISSN)1097-0231","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/875745146326921218\/aDastuGn_normal.jpg","description":"This is the official Twitter acount of the journal 'Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry' (Wiley) \u00b7 Maintained by Dietrich Volmer (RCM Editor)","id_on_source":"rcm_journal","tweeter_id":"875740470483333120","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":7},"tweet_id":"885242817865547776"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Evaluation of peroxidative stress of cancer cells in vitro by real time quantification of volatile aldehydes in culture headspace","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=696371790554449&id=435631946628436","license":"public","citation_ids":[20672023],"posted_on":"2017-06-13T17:52:37+00:00","summary":"Abstract\n\nRationale\n\nPeroxidation of lipids in cellular membranes results in the release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including saturated aldehydes.
