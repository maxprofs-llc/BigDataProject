The purposes of this literature review were to determine the mortality rate of trauma patients with hemodynamic instability and the benefit of prehospital RBC transfusion. A 30-year systematic literature review was performed in 2016. Eligible studies were combined for meta-analysis when tests for heterogeneity were insignificant. The synthesized mortality was 35.6% for systolic blood pressure \u2264 90 mmHg; 51.1% for \u2264 80 mmHg; and 63.9% for \u2264 70 mmHg. For patients with either hypotension or emergency trauma center transfused RBCs, the synthesized Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 27.0 and mortality was 36.2%; the ISS and mortality correlation was r = 0.766 (P = 0.0096). For civilian patients receiving prehospital RBC transfusions, the synthesized ISS was 27.5 and mortality was 39.5%. One civilian study suggested a decrement in mortality with prehospital RBC transfusion; however, patient recruitment was only one per center per year and mortality was < 10% despite an ISS of 37. The same study created a matched control subset and indicated that mortality decreased using multivariate analysis; however, neither the assessed factors nor raw mortality was presented. Civilian studies with patients undergoing prehospital RBC transfusion and a matched control subset showed that the synthesized mortality was similar for those transfused (37.5%) and not transfused (38.7%; P = 0.8933). A study of civilian helicopter patients demonstrated a similar 30-day mortality for those with and without prehospital blood product availability (22% versus 21%; P = 0.626). Mortality in a study of matched military patients was better for those receiving prehospital blood or plasma (8%) than the controls (20%; P = 0.013). However, transfused patients had a shorter prehospital time, more advanced airway procedures, and higher hospital RBC transfusion (P < 0.05). A subset with an ISS > 16 showed similar mortality with and without prehospital RBC availability (27.6% versus 32.0%; P = 0.343). Trauma patient mortality increases with the magnitude of hemodynamic instability and anatomic injury. Some literature evidence indicates no survival advantage with prehospital RBC availability. However, other data suggesting a potential benefit is confounded or likely to be biased.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef6b2a83ee09648b508f","authors":["Huang, Gregory S","Dunham, C Michael"],"first_seen_on":"2017-05-29T00:15:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2160-2026"],"issue":"2","journal":"International Journal of Burns and Trauma ","last_mentioned_on":1496677351,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28533934?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28533934","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28533934\/"],"pmid":"28533934","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Mortality outcomes in trauma patients undergoing prehospital red blood cell transfusion: a systematic literature review.","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mortality-outcomes-trauma-patients-undergoing-prehospital-red-blood-cell-transfusion-systematic-lite"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.3,"score_history":{"1y":5.3,"6m":5.3,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8320311,"mean":7.0122256031246,"rank":1550250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6765881,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8320311,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241233,"mean":12.293401232009,"rank":59218,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":181693,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241233,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":3.1142857142857,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"US":2,"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NWASLibrary\/statuses\/868984099956031488","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20674603],"posted_on":"2017-05-29T00:15:29+00:00","author":{"name":"NWASLibrary","url":"http:\/\/www.networks.nhs.uk\/nhs-networks\/nwas-library-and-information-service","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/602271582116061184\/FuIqklb6_normal.png","description":"North West Ambulance Service NHS Trust, Library & Knowledge Service [NWAS LKS].
