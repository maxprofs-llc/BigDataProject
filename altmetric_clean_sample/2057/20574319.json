However, the prescription rates of these drugs are low at discharge in China. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of continuous quality improvement with mobile-based interventions for clinicians on improving the guideline-adherence of secondary preventive drugs prescription.\nThe quality MISSION-1 study is a cluster-randomized controlled trial. We enrolled 60 hospitals with a bypass surgery volume of more than 30 a year and randomly assigned them into the intervention group or the control group in a 1:1 ratio using minimized random grouping. The intervention group undertakes a series of mobile-based interventions, while the control group maintains a routine practice pattern. All sites consecutively register patients who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting and submit in-hospital data. We require supporting documents regarding prescription information at discharge to adjudicate the outcome measures. The estimated sample size of enrolled patients is 9,600. The primary outcome measure is the prescription rate of statins for eligible patients at discharge. The secondary outcome measures are \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and optimal medical therapy. MISSION-1 study is now recruiting patients.\nThe MISSION-1 study has the potential to identify the effectiveness of interventions on improving secondary prevention adherence at discharge after bypass surgery in China and further disseminate findings to other settings to improve the quality of care.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6083cf058f61000696a","authors":["Chenfei Rao","Junzhe Du","Xi Li","Jing Li","Heng Zhang","Yan Zhao","Shengshou Hu","Lixin Jiang","Zhe Zheng"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ahj.2016.01.014","first_seen_on":"2017-05-26T12:09:34+00:00","issns":["00028703"],"journal":"American Heart Journal","last_mentioned_on":1495794041,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27502847?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27502847","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Rationale and design of a randomized cluster trial to improve guideline-adherence of secondary preventive drugs prescription after coronary artery bypass grafting in China: Measurement and Improvement Studies of Surgical Coronary Revascularization: Secondary Prevention (MISSION-1) Study","type":"article","volume":"178","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rationale-design-randomized-cluster-trial-improve-guidelineadherence-secondary-preventive-drugs-pres"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8272014,"mean":6.980828736602,"rank":7153811,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8272014,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238310,"mean":12.099105338027,"rank":193353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238310,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2077,"mean":6.2123150289017,"rank":1880,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2077,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":8.0377192982456,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
