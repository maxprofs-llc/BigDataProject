Parasites probably enter the glands by specific receptor-ligand interactions with molecules on the surface of the glands. We have undertaken the characterization of salivary gland surface molecules of Aedes aegypti to identify candidate receptors for Plasmodium gallinaceum sporozoite invasion. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were generated against antigen enriched for salivary gland membranes and basal lamina. A panel of 44 mAbs were generated that bound to surface molecules of mosquito tissues. Twenty-four mAbs bound exclusively to salivary glands, six bound to salivary glands and ovaries, one bound to salivary gland and midgut, and 13 bound to all tissues tested. We present data on the immunolocalization and biochemical characteristics of the antigens. Many of the salivary gland-specific mAbs bound preferentially to the median and distal lateral lobes of the salivary glands, indicating that there are anatomical region-specific biochemical differences on the gland surface. These lobes of the salivary glands are the preferential sites of malaria sporozoite invasion. Therefore, antigens specific for these regions are promising candidate receptors for sporozoite invasion. The present identification of surface molecules of mosquito salivary glands by means of monoclonal antibodies represents the first description of individual molecules on the mosquito salivary gland surface. This work lays the basis for further studies on the molecular mechanisms involved in malaria sporozoite invasion of mosquito salivary glands.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae8","authors":["Catherine Barreau","John Conrad","Elizabeth Fischer","Hugo D.
