The first is disilametallacyclic intermediates in the hydrosilane reduction of carbonyl compounds. Experimental and theoretical studies on disilaplatinacycles suggested that the H2Pt(iv)Si2 species generated by oxidative addition of 1,2-bis(dimethylsilyl)benzene behaves as a highly reactive hydride to reduce amides to amines. This mechanism via disilametallacyclic intermediates explains the efficient hydrosilane reduction of carbonyl compounds with \u03b1,\u03c9-bifunctional hydrosilanes catalyzed by other transition metals. The second is hydrogenation of alkenes by disilaferra- or disilaruthenacyclic complexes as catalyst precursors. A new mechanism not involving the conventional oxidative addition of H2 was suggested from DFT calculations, in which activation of the H-H bond occurs in the metal-silicon bond of the disilametallacyclic intermediate. Disilametallacyclic intermediates contribute to efficient catalytic reactions through this \u03c3-CAM (\u03c3-complex assisted mechanism) type mechanism.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Hideo Nagashima","Yusuke Sunada"],"doi":"10.1039\/c7dt01275f","first_seen_on":"2017-05-26T12:09:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1477-9234"],"journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1495794009,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2017\/DT\/C7DT01275F?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=inorganicnews"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2017\/dt\/c7dt01275f","pmid":"28607972","pubdate":"2017-05-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Disilametallacyclic chemistry for efficient catalysis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/disilametallacyclic-chemistry-efficient-catalysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8272014,"mean":6.980828736602,"rank":7153811,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8272014,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238309,"mean":12.099157157964,"rank":193353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238309,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11251,"mean":0.70249884444444,"rank":3217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11251,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":378,"mean":1.1525198938992,"rank":146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":378,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/InorganicNews\/statuses\/868049108900040705","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20574280],"posted_on":"2017-05-26T10:20:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Inorganic News","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1636129253\/DSC01061_2_normal.JPG","description":"News, comments and publications about Inorganic Chemistry.","id_on_source":"InorganicNews","tweeter_id":"411132501","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1288},"tweet_id":"868049108900040705"}]}}
