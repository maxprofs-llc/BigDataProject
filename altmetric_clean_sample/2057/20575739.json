Study items included name, sex, date of birth, date of initial hospital visit, diagnosis, address, recurrence, sibling cases, gammaglobulin treatment, and cardiac lesion in the acute stage or 1 month after onset.\nOf the 2663 hospitals, 68.5% responded, reporting 12 966 patients-7489 males and 5477 females. Of the total patients reported, 6373 (incidence rate of 108.0 per 100 000 children <5 years old) occurred in 1997, and 6593 (111.7) in 1998. More than one half of the patients (54.9%) were <2 years old and 81.6% were <4 years old. In males, the incidence rates of cardiac lesions were 27.2 in the acute stage and 10.1 a month after onset. In females, the rates were 16.7 and 5.2, respectively. The incidence rates of cardiac lesions were highest in the youngest age group (<6 months old) both in the acute stage and 1 month after onset. The rates decreased with increasing ages. Although frequency of giant aneurysms was not high at the acute stage, it did not decrease 1 month after onset.\nThe incidence rates have been steadily increasing for 11 years since 1987. The rate in 1998 was over 1.5 times higher than that in 1987. The age and sex distributions were identical in each survey. Although most of the cardiac lesions at the acute stage decreased to half or less 1 month after onset, giant aneurysms did not decrease and existed persistently after 1 month.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032b7","authors":["Hiroshi Yanagawa","Yosikazu Nakamura","Mayumi Yashiro","Izumi Oki","Shizuhiro Hirata","Tuohong Zhang","Tomisaku Kawasaki"],"doi":"10.1542\/peds.107.3.e33","first_seen_on":"2017-05-26T12:36:02+00:00","issns":["0031-4005","1098-4275"],"issue":"3","journal":"Pediatrics","last_mentioned_on":1104537600,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1542\/peds.107.3.e33"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pediatrics.aappublications.org\/content\/pediatrics\/107\/3\/e33.full.pdf","pmid":"11230614","pubdate":"2001-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Academy of Pediatrics","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Incidence Survey of Kawasaki Disease in 1997 and 1998 in Japan","type":"article","volume":"107","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/incidence-survey-kawasaki-disease-1997-1998-japan"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7800879,"mean":6.6298854457091,"rank":1909573,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4820463,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7800879,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100151,"mean":11.179126849726,"rank":29549,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":69690,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100151,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10113,"mean":26.839732397152,"rank":5245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":3446,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10113,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92,"mean":66.675252747253,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
