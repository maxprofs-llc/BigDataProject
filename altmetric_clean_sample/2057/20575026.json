However, it remains unclear how the coordinated behaviour of cytoskeletal network may contribute to cell junctional dynamics. In this report, we identified ACF7, a crosslinker of microtubules and F-actin, as an essential player in this process. Loss of ACF7 leads to aberrant microtubule organization, tight junction stabilization and impaired wound closure in vitro. With the mouse genetics approach, we show that ablation of ACF7 inhibits intestinal wound healing and greatly increases susceptibility to experimental colitis in mice. ACF7 level is also correlated with development and progression of ulcerative colitis (UC) in human patients. Together, our results reveal an important molecular mechanism whereby coordinated cytoskeletal dynamics contributes to cell adhesion regulation during intestinal wound repair and the development of IBD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Ma, Yanlei","Yue, Jiping","Zhang, Yao","Shi, Chenzhang","Odenwald, Matt","Liang, Wenguang G","Wei, Qing","Goel, Ajay","Gou, Xuewen","Zhang, Jamie","Chen, Shao-Yu","Tang, Wei-Jen","Turner, Jerrold R","Yang, Feng","Liang, Hong","Qin, Huanlong","Wu, Xiaoyang"],"doi":"10.1038\/ncomms15375","first_seen_on":"2017-05-26T12:21:57+00:00","funders":["niehs","niams"],"handles":[],"issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","last_mentioned_on":1495795051,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28541346?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28541346","pubdate":"2017-05-26T22:09:15+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["science","biology"],"title":"ACF7 regulates inflammatory colitis and intestinal wound response by orchestrating tight junction dynamics.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/acf7-regulates-inflammatory-colitis-intestinal-wound-response-orchestrating-tight-junction-dynamics"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8272014,"mean":6.980828736602,"rank":7153814,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8272014,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238309,"mean":12.099150024338,"rank":193356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238309,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12893,"mean":44.30276016134,"rank":12361,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12893,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1016,"mean":61.288912315271,"rank":975,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1016,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
