We examined the protective effects of 3 mo treatment of streptozotocin-diabetic rats with a highly selective COX-2 inhibitor (SC-58236) in terms of albuminuria, renal hypertrophy, and the excretion of TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2, which have also been implicated in the detrimental renal effects of diabetes. SC-58236 treatment (3 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1)) of diabetic rats resulted in reduced urinary excretion of PGE(2), 6-ketoPGF(1\u03b1), and thromboxane B(2), all of which were increased in the diabetic rat compared with age-matched nondiabetic rats. However, serum thromboxane B(2) levels were unchanged, confirming the selectivity of SC-58236 for COX-2. The renal protective effects of treatment of diabetic rats with the COX-2 inhibitor were reflected by a marked reduction in albuminuria, a reduction in kidney weight-to-body weight ratio, and TGF-\u03b2 excretion and a marked decrease in the urinary excretion of TNF-\u03b1. The protective effects of SC-58236 were independent of changes in plasma glucose levels or serum advanced glycation end-product levels, which were not different from those of untreated diabetic rats. In an additional study, the inhibition of COX-2 with SC-58236 for 4 wk in diabetic rats resulted in creatinine clearance rates not different from those of control rats. These results confirm that the inhibition of COX-2 in the streptozotocin-diabetic rat confers renal protection and suggest that the induction of COX-2 precedes the increases in cytokines, TNF-\u03b1, and TGF-\u03b2.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002210","authors":["J.
