Elevated phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 has been observed in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients and Alzheimer's disease model mice. Therefore, we tested whether suppressing eIF2\u03b1 kinases could alleviate synaptic plasticity and memory deficits in Alzheimer's disease model mice. Genetic deletion of eIF2\u03b1 kinase PERK prevented enhanced phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and deficits in protein synthesis, synaptic plasticity and spatial memory in mice that express familial Alzheimer's disease-related mutations in APP and PSEN1. Similarly, deletion of another eIF2\u03b1 kinase, GCN2, prevented impairments of synaptic plasticity and defects in spatial memory exhibited by the Alzheimer's disease model mice. Our findings implicate aberrant eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation as a previously unidentified molecular mechanism underlying Alzheimer's disease-related synaptic pathophysioloy and memory dysfunction and suggest that PERK and GCN2 are potential therapeutic targets for treatment of individuals with Alzheimer's disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f610003167","authors":["Tao Ma","Mimi A Trinh","Alyse J Wexler","Clarisse Bourbon","Evelina Gatti","Philippe Pierre","Douglas R Cavener","Eric Klann"],"doi":"10.1038\/nn.3486","endpage":"1305","first_seen_on":"2013-08-12T07:08:46+00:00","issns":["1097-6256","1546-1726"],"journal":"Nature Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1501208076,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/neuro\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/nn.3486.html","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/nn.3486","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/neuro\/journal\/v16\/n9\/abs\/nn.3486.html","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23933749","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/neuro\/journal\/v16\/n9\/full\/nn.3486.html?foxtrotcallback=true"],"pmid":"23933749","pubdate":"2013-08-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Alzheimer's disease","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Hippocampus","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Long-term potentiation","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"1299","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Suppression of eIF2\u03b1 kinases alleviates Alzheimer's disease-related plasticity and memory deficits.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/suppression-eif2%CE%B1-kinases-alleviates-alzheimers-diseaserelated-plasticity-memory-deficits"},"altmetric_score":{"score":92.172,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":92.172},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8286032,"mean":6.9859461464656,"rank":92582,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":8193518,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8286032,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":129113,"mean":7.0722594336701,"rank":1556,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":127557,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":129113,"percentile":98},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3430,"mean":31.73464391951,"rank":276,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":3154,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3430,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79,"mean":39.978153846154,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":70,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":12,"Researcher":44,"Student  > Doctoral Student":16,"Student  > Ph.
