We report microRNAs that are differentially expressed between breast normal fibroblasts and CAFs of oestrogen receptor-positive cancers, and explore the influences of one of these, miR-26b, on breast cancer biology. We identified differentially expressed microRNAs by expression profiling of clinical samples and a tissue culture model: miR-26b was the most highly deregulated microRNA. Using qPCR, miR-26b was confirmed as down-regulated in fibroblasts from 15 of 18 further breast cancers. Next, we examined whether manipulation of miR-26b expression changed breast fibroblast behaviour. Reduced miR-26b expression caused fibroblast migration and invasion to increase by up to three-fold in scratch-closure and trans-well assays. Furthermore, in co-culture with MCF7 breast cancer epithelial cells, fibroblasts with reduced miR-26b expression enhanced both MCF7 migration in trans-well assays and MCF7 invasion from three-dimensional spheroids by up to five-fold. Mass spectrometry was used to identify expression changes associated with the reduction of miR-26b expression in fibroblasts. Pathway analyses of differentially expressed proteins revealed that glycolysis\/TCA cycle and cytoskeletal regulation by Rho GTPases are downstream of miR-26b. In addition, three novel miR-26b targets were identified (TNKS1BP1, CPSF7, COL12A1) and the expression of each in cancer stroma was shown to be significantly associated with breast cancer recurrence. MiR-26b in breast CAFs is a potent regulator of cancer behaviour in oestrogen receptor-positive cancers, and we have identified key genes and molecular pathways that act downstream of miR-26b in CAFs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dc7","authors":["Verghese, Eldo T","Drury, Ruth","Green, Caroline A","Holliday, Deborah L","Lu, Xiaomei","Nash, Claire","Speirs, Valerie","Thorne, James L","Thygesen, Helene H","Zougman, Alexandre","Hull, Mark A","Hanby, Andrew M","Hughes, Thomas A"],"doi":"10.1002\/path.4248","endpage":"399","first_seen_on":"2013-08-12T15:56:45+00:00","funders":["mrc","cruk"],"issns":["1096-9896","0022-3417"],"issue":"3","journal":"The Journal of Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1381344101,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/path.4248&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/path.4248\/abstract;jsessionid=DEFA6387DFD1E81372EFA34FFEE15FC0.f03t03"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/path.4248\/pdf","pmid":"23939832","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"388","subjects":["pathology"],"title":"MiR\u00e2\u0080\u009026b is down\u00e2\u0080\u0090regulated in carcinoma\u00e2\u0080\u0090associated fibroblasts from ER positive breast cancers leading to enhanced cell migration and invasion","type":"article","volume":"231","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mir26b-downregulated-carcinomaassociated-fibroblasts-erpositive-breast-cancers-leading-enhanced-cell"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6713246,"mean":6.1608598324636,"rank":4730261,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1739491,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6713246,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122945,"mean":6.7442334070798,"rank":70895,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":45464,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122945,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1027,"mean":3.3630506822612,"rank":785,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1027,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":3.945,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
