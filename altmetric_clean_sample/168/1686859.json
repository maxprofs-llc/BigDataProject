PRL-3, a metastasis-associated phosphatase, is a downstream target of FLT3-ITD. This study investigates the regulation and function of PRL-3 in leukaemia cell lines and AML patients associated with FLT3-ITD mutations. PRL-3 expression is upregulated by the FLT3-STAT5 signalling pathway in leukaemia cells, leading an activation of AP-1 transcription factors via ERK and JNK pathways. PRL-3-depleted AML cells showed a significant decrease in cell growth. Clinically, high PRL-3 mRNA expression was associated with FLT3-ITD mutations in four independent AML datasets with 1158 patients. Multivariable Cox-regression analysis on our Cohort 1 with 221 patients identified PRL-3 as a novel prognostic marker independent of other clinical parameters. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed high PRL-3 mRNA expression was significantly associated with poorer survival among 491 patients with normal karyotype. Targeting PRL-3 reversed the oncogenic effects in FLT3-ITD AML models in vitro and in vivo. Herein, we suggest that PRL-3 could serve as a prognostic marker to predict poorer survival and as a promising novel therapeutic target for AML patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6163cf058f61000723b","authors":["Park, Jung Eun","Yuen, Hiu Fung","Zhou, Jian Biao","Al\u2010aidaroos, Abdul Qader O.","Guo, Ke","Valk, Peter J.","Zhang, Shu Dong","Chng, Wee Joo","Hong, Cheng William","Mills, Ken","Zeng, Qi"],"doi":"10.1002\/emmm.201202183","endpage":"1366","first_seen_on":"2013-08-13T21:52:44+00:00","issns":["1757-4684","1757-4676"],"issue":"9","journal":"EMBO Molecular Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1376890801,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/emmm.201202183\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/emmm.201202183\/pdf","pmid":"23929599","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"1351","subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Oncogenic roles of PRL\u00e2\u0080\u00903 in FLT3\u00e2\u0080\u0090ITD induced acute myeloid leukaemia","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/oncogenic-roles-prl3-flt3itd-induced-acute-myeloid-leukaemia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6640423,"mean":6.1508141627114,"rank":4668759,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1727754,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6640423,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103869,"mean":7.7344252705358,"rank":65797,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":34081,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103869,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":548,"mean":13.746950639854,"rank":435,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":93,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":548,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":25.73125,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
