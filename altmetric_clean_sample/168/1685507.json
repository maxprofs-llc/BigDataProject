In contrast to orchidectomy and Burdizzo castration, the stress response of calves to shortening of the scrotum is unknown. In this study, partial scrotal resection in bull calves was compared with orchidectomy, Burdizzo castration, and controls without intervention (n=10 per group, ages 56 \u00b1 3 d). Procedures were performed under xylazine sedation and local anesthesia. We hypothesized that partial scrotal resection is least stressful. Salivary cortisol, heart rate, heart rate variability, behavior, and locomotion were analyzed. Cortisol concentration peaked 60 min after start of the procedures. Cortisol release was at least in part xylazine induced and none of the experimental procedures released additional cortisol. Heart rate increased in calves of all groups with initial handling, but immediately after xylazine sedation decreased to 30% below initial values and was not modified by surgical procedures. The heart rate variability variables standard deviation of beat-to-beat interval and root mean square of successive beat-to-beat differences increased when calves were placed on the surgery table but effects were similar in calves submitted to surgeries and control calves. Locomotion increased, whereas lying time decreased in response to all surgeries. Locomotion increase was most pronounced after orchidectomy. Plasma fibrinogen concentrations increased after orchidectomy only. With adequate pain medication, orchidectomy, Burdizzo castration, and partial scrotal resection do not differ with regard to acute stress and, by inference, pain. Partial scrotal resection when carried out under xylazine sedation and local anesthesia thus is an acceptable castration technique in bull calves.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d4a","doi":"10.3168\/jds.2013-6683","first_seen_on":"2013-08-13T10:13:30+00:00","issns":["1525-3198"],"journal":"Journal of Dairy Science","last_mentioned_on":1428504049,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23932135?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23932135","pubdate":"2013-08-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Physiological and behavioral stress parameters in calves in response to partial scrotal resection, orchidectomy, and Burdizzo castration.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/physiological-behavioral-stress-parameters-calves-response-partial-scrotal-resection-orchidectomy-bu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4974025,"mean":5.8881205346046,"rank":4159260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4974025,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94255,"mean":7.7979097969317,"rank":78240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94255,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2104,"mean":2.3103328578222,"rank":1758,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2104,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":4.4641052631579,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
