Most HCV-infected individuals do not clear the virus resulting in a chronic infection that may potentially lead to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition to hepatic manifestations, HCV infection is associated with B cell lymphoproliferative disorders, including mixed cryoglobulinemia, usually a benign condition, and overt B cell lymphoma. A direct role of HCV infection in the genesis of these B cell lymphoproliferative disorders has been suggested initially by epidemiological studies and is supported by recent studies, which analyzed the monoclonal B cells that proliferate in these disorders. How HCV induces B cell lymphoproliferative disorders is still unclear, it is probably not due to direct change of phenotype in B cells after viral infection, but may be due to an HCV-antigen driven process. Support for this hypothesis comes from the analysis of monoclonal B cells found in these disorders, which use a restricted repertoire of immunoglobulin variable region genes that are similar to those used by B cells that secrete anti-HCV antibodies. The fact that monoclonal IgM is resolved in HCV-infected patients who responded to anti-viral treatment supports the linkage between antigen persistence and B cell proliferation. Finally, the linkage between benign B cell proliferation and overt lymphoma is supported by the identification of a pre-malignant B cell clone that subsequently converted to an overt B cell lymphoma. The molecular basis for viral induced B cell proliferation is still unknown. One possibility is that HCV stimulates the proliferation of monoclonal B cells via their HCV-specific B cell receptor (BCR) on the cell surface. Binding of the HCVenvelope proteins to a cellular ligand, CD81, may also enhance this antigen-driven process. A recent report on regression of splenic marginal zone lymphoma after anti-viral treatment with interferon and ribavirin has significantly strengthened the cause-effect relationship between HCV infection and lymphoma. Further studies should determine whether BCRs expressed on HCV-associated lymphomas, particularly those that regress in response to anti-viral therapy, bind HCV antigens that stimulate their proliferation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52d3cf058f610004181","authors":["Wen-Kai Weng","Shoshana Levy"],"doi":"10.1080\/1042819031000076972","endpage":"1120","first_seen_on":"2013-08-12T23:05:13+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["1042-8194","1029-2403"],"issue":"7","journal":"Leukemia & Lymphoma","last_mentioned_on":1376348420,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/pdfplus\/10.1080\/1042819031000076972","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12916862"],"pmid":"12916862","pubdate":"2003-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"1113","subjects":["neoplasms","hematology"],"title":"Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and Lymphomagenesis","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hepatitis-c-virus-hcv-lymphomagenesis-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505915,"mean":5.1093654012801,"rank":2329857,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1530291,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505915,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90541,"mean":7.5935263529933,"rank":45632,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":30194,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90541,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":762,"mean":1.3765256241787,"rank":278,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":375,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":762,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":1.46,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/drshruti2611\/statuses\/367057997601579009","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1684255],"posted_on":"2013-08-12T23:00:20+00:00","author":{"name":"ILuvHemeOnc","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/445429870009389057\/TJPppfsO_normal.jpeg","description":"Stay hungry Stay foolish","id_on_source":"drshruti2611","tweeter_id":"398216609","geo":{"lt":"41.8756208","ln":"-87.6243706","country":"US"},"followers":39},"tweet_id":"367057997601579009"}]}}
