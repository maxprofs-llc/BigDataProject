In this investigation, we developed a rapid and interference-free approach for IMA determination using quantum dots-coupled X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy (Q-XRF). In a typical Q-XRF assay, serum total HSA is quantified using quantum dot-coupled sandwich immunoassay, and intact HSA (iHSA) is determined using a XRF spectroscopy, by measuring XRF intensity of Co (II) bonded to iHSA. IMA concentration is automatically determined within 30 min by calculating the difference between total HSA and iHSA. This strategy can effectively eliminate the interference from native HSA level. Results show that no significant influences have been observed from hemolysis or high levels of cholesterol (7 mg\/L), triglyceride (5.2 mg\/L), IgG (10 g\/L), and fibrinogen (4 g\/L). A linearity of 1-100mg\/mL is obtained in iHSA determination using XRF (r(2)=0.979). The proposed Q-XRF assay demonstrates a lowest detection limit of 0.05 U\/mL. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves reveal that Q-XRF assay provide an improved sensitivity than ACB assay (95.9% vs. 82.9%) in differentiating ischemic patients from health individuals, at an optimal cutoff point of 79.2U\/mL. The proposed approach provides a new strategy for interference-free, simple and rapid evaluation of IMA concentration by combining sandwich immunoassay and XRF spectroscopy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f7","authors":["Yang Luo","Chaoming Wang","Tianlun Jiang","Bo Zhang","Junfu Huang","Pu Liao","Weiling Fu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bios.2013.07.046","endpage":"142","first_seen_on":"2013-08-14T16:48:12+00:00","issns":["09565663"],"journal":"Biosensors & Bioelectronics","last_mentioned_on":1376499319,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0956566313005186"],"pmid":"23948244","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"136","title":"Interference-free determination of ischemia-modified albumin using quantum dot coupled X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy","type":"article","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interferencefree-determination-ischemiamodified-albumin-using-quantum-dot-coupled-xray-fluorescence"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6230817,"mean":5.9681223701699,"rank":2927340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1858865,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6230817,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100766,"mean":7.7847766188658,"rank":49685,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":37056,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100766,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1747,"mean":2.4720595647194,"rank":637,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":884,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1747,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":1.5375,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
