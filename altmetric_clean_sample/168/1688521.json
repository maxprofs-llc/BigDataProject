Thus, patients suffering from these PAK1-dependent diseases have to rely on solely a variety of herbal therapeutics such as propolis and curcumin that block PAK1 without affecting normal cell growth. Furthermore, several recent studies revealed that some of these herbal therapeutics significantly extend the lifespan of nematodes (C. elegans) and fruit flies (Drosophila), and PAK1-deficient worm lives longer than the wild type. Here, I outline mainly pathological phenotypes of hyper-activated PAK1 and a list of herbal therapeutics that block PAK1, but cause no side (harmful) effect on healthy people or animals.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005c3a","authors":["Maruta H","Maruta, Hiroshi","Hiroshi Maruta"],"doi":"10.1002\/ptr.5054","endpage":"672","first_seen_on":"2013-08-14T14:46:11+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1099-1573","0951-418X","0951418X"],"issue":"5","journal":"Phytotherapy Research","last_mentioned_on":1484918478,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ptr.5054\/abstract;jsessionid=80C91EE355058105400A992A36BCD4A9.d03t04","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23943274","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/23943274\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/ptr.5054","http:\/\/ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23943274"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ptr.5054\/pdf","pmid":"23943274","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley and Sons Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"656","subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"Herbal Therapeutics that Block the Oncogenic Kinase PAK1: A Practical Approach towards PAK1\u2010dependent Diseases and Longevity","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/ptr.5054","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/herbal-therapeutics-block-oncogenic-kinase-pak1-practical-approach-towards-pak1dependent-diseases-lo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8089090,"mean":6.870452360944,"rank":3376655,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4661265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8089090,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128281,"mean":7.0551032429063,"rank":42361,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":85063,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128281,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1346,"mean":5.9718334572491,"rank":580,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":760,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1346,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":5.1444615384615,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
