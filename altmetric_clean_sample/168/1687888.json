However, their use is limited because of contamination of isolated cells with other testicular cells, mainly germ cells. The aim was to establish technique to obtain pure yak Sertoli cells as well as to study the growth kinetics and biological characteristics of Sertoli cells in vitro. Two-step enzyme digestion was used to separate and culture yak Sertoli cells. Cultured using starvation method and the hypotonic treatment were also invented to get pure yak Sertoli cells. Furthermore, the purification of Yak Sertoli cells were identified according to their characteristics, such as bipolar corpuscular around the nucleus and expression of Fasl, in addition to their morphology. The average viability of the Sertoli cells was 97% before freezing and 94.5% after thawing, indicating that cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen had little influence on the viability of Sertoli cells. The growth tendency of yak Sertoli cells was similar to an S-shaped growth curve. Purified yak Sertoli cells frequently exhibited bipolar corpuscula in nucleus after Feulgen staining, and did have a positive reaction of Fasl by the immunocytochemical identification. After recovery chromosomal analysis of Sertoli cells had a normal chromosomal number of 60, comprising 29 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes. Assays for bacteria, fungi and mycoplasmas were negative. In conclusion, yak Sertoli cells have been successfully purified and cultured in vitro, and maintain stable biological characteristics after thawing. Therefore, it will not only preserve the genetic resources of yaks at the cellular level, but also provide valuable materials for transgenic research and feeder layer and nuclear donor cells in yak somatic cell cloning technology.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008b98","doi":"10.1016\/j.tice.2013.07.004","first_seen_on":"2013-08-14T10:02:55+00:00","issns":["1532-3072"],"journal":"Tissue and Cell","last_mentioned_on":1376474570,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23938058?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23938058","pubdate":"2013-08-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["histology","cellbiology"],"title":"Pure cultures and characterization of yak Sertoli cells.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pure-cultures-characterization-yak-sertoli-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3616387,"mean":4.9300280987737,"rank":2902375,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":71341,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3616387,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85071,"mean":7.563790196309,"rank":67865,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85071,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78,"mean":1.9283636363636,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.05,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":4,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Unspecified":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1,"Arts and Humanities":1,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Bipolar_Blogs\/statuses\/367587105670582272","license":"public","citation_ids":[1687888],"posted_on":"2013-08-14T10:02:50+00:00","author":{"name":"Bipolar Blogs","url":"http:\/\/www.pathsoflight.us\/bipolarwinds","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3605210516\/e9da8d6cabf3994c6ec4ab42483804b9_normal.png","description":"Blogs & news from the minds of people living with bipolar and researchers.
