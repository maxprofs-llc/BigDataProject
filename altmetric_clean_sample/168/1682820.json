Jugular blood samples were collected from all cows during the periparturient period for analysis of various blood cell and plasma parameters. A significantly higher total leukocyte count, lymphocyte count, neutrophil count and neutrophil\/lymphocyte ratio was recorded in the guduchi supplemented treatment group in comparison to untreated control cows throughout the experimental period. The increase of milk production over 305\u2003days of lactation due to guduchi supplementation was significant (p\u2003<\u20030.05). A significant (p\u2003<\u20030.05) reduction in somatic cell count was also observed during the experimental period. Milk composition (fat, protein, lactose and SNF) was similar (p\u2003>\u20030.05) for both the groups. Plasma non esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations were significantly higher (p\u2003<\u20030.01) in cows supplemented with guduchi throughout the course of study. Plasma concentration of growth hormone in the treated cows was also significantly higher beginning on the day of parturition up to 3\u2003weeks postpartum (p\u2003<\u20030.05) in comparison to unsupplemented group.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c85","authors":["Mallick S","Prakash BS"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1439-0396.2011.01228.x","first_seen_on":"2013-08-12T05:30:54+00:00","issns":["0931-2439"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Animal Physiology & Animal Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1376285449,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21895784"],"pmid":"21895784","pubdate":"2011-09-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["physiology","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Influence of feeding Tinospora cordifolia peripartum on lactation parameters in crossbred cows.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-feeding-tinospora-cordifolia-peripartum-lactation-parameters-crossbred-cows"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3069960,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":946495,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90546,"mean":7.6137808603459,"rank":61434,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":17857,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90546,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":311,"mean":1.3177419354839,"rank":113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":97,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":311,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.75,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
