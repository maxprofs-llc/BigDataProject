With the exception of cannabinol (CBN) and delta 1-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta 1-THC), the cannabinoids and olivetol (their biosynthetic precursor) demonstrated activity in the PBQ test exhibiting their maximal effect at doses of about 100 micrograms\/kg. delta 1-THC only became maximally effective in doses of 10 mg\/kg. This higher dose corresponded to that which induced catalepsy and is indicative of a central action. CNB demonstrated little activity and even at doses in excess of 10 mg\/kg could only produce a 40% inhibition of PBQ-induced writhing. Cannabinoid (CBD) was the most effective of the cannabinoids at doses of 100 micrograms\/kg. Doses of cannabinoids that were effective in the analgesic test orally were used topically to antagonize TPA-induced erythema of skin. The fact that delta 1-THC and CBN were the least effective in this test suggests a structural relationship between analgesic activity and antiinflammatory activity among the cannabinoids related to their peripheral actions and separate from the central effects of delta 1-THC.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ac7","authors":["Formukong, E A","Evans, A T","Evans, F J"],"first_seen_on":"2013-08-10T20:41:14+00:00","issns":["0360-3997"],"issue":"4","journal":"Inflammation","last_mentioned_on":1506389255,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3169967","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3169967"],"pmid":"3169967","pubdate":"1988-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["pathology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Analgesic and antiinflammatory activity of constituents of Cannabis sativa L.","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/analgesic-antiinflammatory-activity-constituents-cannabis-sativa-l-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0.5,"1w":0.5,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462170,"mean":7.1084920520889,"rank":3681740,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4658713,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462170,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":129858,"mean":7.0954559399957,"rank":45244,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":82560,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":129858,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":475,"mean":1.489776371308,"rank":76,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":396,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":475,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":1.17,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
