Kligman as a remnant of human development, a 'living fossil with a past but no future'. However, the last two decades of studies and the discovery of neuro-endocrine pathways in skin have determined the importance of the SG in cutaneous biology and homeostasis. SGs play their role in cutaneous homeostasis by contribution to local steroidogenic pathways, antimicrobial activity and display of immune (both pro- and anti-inflammatory) properties. Despite several important manuscripts and reviews regarding SG biology and function, there was an urgent need for a high-quality methodological guide through SG identification and quantitative evaluation. In this issue of Experimental Dermatology, Hinde et al. present a practical guide to SG research - outlining methods, defining immunohistochemical markers and providing guidance to both novice and more experienced SG researchers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002891","authors":["Nejati, Reza","Skobowiat, Cezary","Slominski, Andrzej T."],"doi":"10.1111\/exd.12221","endpage":"630","first_seen_on":"2013-08-13T16:41:36+00:00","funders":["niams"],"issns":["1600-0625","0906-6705"],"issue":"10","journal":"Experimental Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1376411975,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/exd.12221\/abstract;jsessionid=BB799915D3B440A912D631D38E4DAAEF.d04t04"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/exd.12221\/pdf","pmid":"24079730","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"629","subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Commentary on the practical guide for the study of sebaceous glands","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/commentary-practical-guide-study-sebaceous-glands-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3071739,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":948939,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90532,"mean":7.6502406910342,"rank":62017,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":18151,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90532,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":636,"mean":2.3576503937008,"rank":351,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":636,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":2.2297142857143,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Chemistry":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Dermatology_OW\/statuses\/367324565652766720","license":"public","citation_ids":[1686360],"posted_on":"2013-08-13T16:39:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Dermatology Wisdom","url":"http:\/\/t.co\/4gTiJFdadY","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/907039947\/twitter_image_normal.png","description":"Organizing dermatology resources shared by health experts, advocates, and organizations into WisdomCards.","id_on_source":"Dermatology_OW","tweeter_id":"17203917","geo":{"lt":40.71455,"ln":-74.007124,"country":"US"},"followers":1716},"tweet_id":"367324565652766720"}]}}
