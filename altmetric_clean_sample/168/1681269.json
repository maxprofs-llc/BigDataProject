[Baur\u00e8s, R., Benguigui, N., Amorim, M.-A., & Siegler, I. A. (2007). Intercepting free falling objects: Better use Occam's razor than internalize Newton's law. Vision Research, 47, 2982-2991] rejected the hypothesis that free-falling objects are intercepted using a predictive model of gravity. They argued instead for \"a continuous guide for action timing\" based on visual information updated till target capture. Here we show that their arguments are flawed, because they fail to consider the impact of sensori-motor delays on interception behaviour and the need for neural compensation of such delays. When intercepting a free-falling object, the delays can be overcome by a predictive model of the effects of gravity on target motion.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003709","authors":["Zago M","McIntyre J","Senot P","Lacquaniti F"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.visres.2008.04.005","first_seen_on":"2013-08-10T19:28:44+00:00","issns":["00426989"],"issue":"14","journal":"Vision Research","last_mentioned_on":1376162910,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0042698908001946"],"pmid":"18499213","pubdate":"2008-01-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Internal models and prediction of visual gravitational motion ","type":"article","volume":"48","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/internal-models-prediction-visual-gravitational-motion"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505915,"mean":5.1093654012801,"rank":2330277,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1529439,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505915,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90718,"mean":7.5643202927788,"rank":45715,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":30226,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90718,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":684,"mean":3.5195754026354,"rank":404,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":684,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.325,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":17,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
