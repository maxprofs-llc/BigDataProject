To define the neuroimaging features of this disorder we studied two patients affected by ECCL and compared our data with those reported in the literature. Sonographic, CT, and MR imaging examinations showed quite specific CNS findings that are highly suggestive of the diagnosis of ECCL. To our knowledge this is the first report of a complete neuroradiologic evaluation and follow-up of this disorder.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f610006984","authors":["Cecilia Parazzini","Fabio Triulzi","Gianni Russo","Massimo Mastrangelo","Giuseppe Scotti"],"first_seen_on":"2017-03-06T01:36:39+00:00","issns":["0195-6108","1936-959X"],"issue":"1","journal":"American Journal of Neuroradiology","last_mentioned_on":1488764185,"links":["http:\/\/www.ajnr.org\/content\/20\/1\/173.long"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ajnr.org\/content\/20\/1\/173.full.pdf","pmid":"9974077","pubdate":"1999-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["radiology","neurology"],"title":"Encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis: complete neuroradiologic evaluation and follow-up of two cases.","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/encephalocraniocutaneous-lipomatosis-complete-neuroradiologic-evaluation-followup-two-cases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317445,"mean":7.0084957256017,"rank":4429621,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2315199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317445,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241883,"mean":13.682332203305,"rank":138926,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":80258,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241883,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2498,"mean":3.5558125750901,"rank":1422,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":783,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2498,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99,"mean":4.8408163265306,"rank":77,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
