During intracellular processing, hFVIII is predominantly cleaved at a Paired basic Amino acid Cleaving Enzyme (PACE) or furin cleavage site to yield a heterodimer that is the major form of secreted protein. Previous studies with B-domain deleted (BDD) canine FVIII and hFVIII-R1645H, both differing from hFVIII by a single amino acid at this site, suggested that these proteins are secreted mainly in a single polypeptide chain (SC) form and exhibit enhanced function.\nWe hypothesized that deletion(s) of the furin site modulate FVIII biology and may enhance its function.\nA series of recombinant hFVIII-furin deletion variants were introduced into hFVIII-BDD [\u03941645, 1645-46(\u03942), 1645-47(\u03943), 1645-48(\u03944), or \u03941648] and characterized.\nIn vitro, recombinant purified \u03943 and \u03944 were primarily SC and, interestingly, had 2-fold higher procoagulant activity compared to FVIII-BDD. In vivo, the variants also have improved hemostatic function. After adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector delivery, the expression of these variants is 2-4 fold higher than hFVIII-BDD. Protein challenges of each variant in mice tolerant to hFVIII-BDD showed no anti-FVIII immune response.\nThese data suggest that the furin deletion hFVIII variants are superior to hFVIII-BDD without increased immunogenicity. In the setting of gene-based therapeutics, these novel variants provide a unique strategy to increase FVIII expression thus lowering the vector dose, a critical factor for hemophilia A gene therapy.
