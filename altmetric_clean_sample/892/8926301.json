Previous PET studies have documented the relationship between COMT Val158Met polymorphism and D1 and D2\/3 receptor binding potential (BP), and interpreted them in terms of dopaminergic tone. The use of baseline dopamine D1 and D2\/3 receptor binding potential (BPND) as a proxy for dopaminergic tone is problematic because they reflect both endogenous dopamine levels (a change in radiotracer's apparent affinity) and receptor density. In this analysis of 31 healthy controls genotyped for the Val158Met polymorphism (Val\/Val, Val\/Met, and Met\/Met), we used amphetamine-induced displacement of [11C]FLB 457 as a direct measure of dopamine release. Our analysis failed to show a relationship between COMT genotype status and prefrontal cortical dopamine release. COMT genotype was also not predictive of baseline dopamine D2\/3 receptor BPND.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Rajesh Narendran","Divya Tumuluru","Maureen A.
