Experimental studies suggest perinatal exposure to EDCs results in later obesity. However, the few epidemiological investigations on dioxins are inconclusive. We investigated perinatal exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like compounds, infant growth and body mass index (BMI) in childhood.\nWe pooled data from 3 European birth cohorts (Belgian, Norwegian, Slovak) with exposure assessment in cord blood or breast milk. Two cohorts had dioxin-like toxicity assessed using dioxin-responsive chemical-activated luciferase expression (DR-CALUX) bioassay and one cohort had measured concentrations of dioxins, furans and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenols with CALUX relative potency values applied. Growth was cohort- and sex-specific change in weight-for-age z-score between birth and 24months (N=367). BMI was calculated at around 7years (median 7.17, interquartile range [IQR] 7.00-7.37years, N=251), and overweight defined according to international standards for children equivalent to adult BMI >25kg\/m(2) (Cole and Lobstein, 2012). We fitted multivariate models using generalized estimating equations, and tested effect modification by sex, breastfeeding and cohort. Results per 10pgCALUXTEQ\/g lipid increase in exposure.\nDioxin exposure was highest in the Belgian and lowest in the Norwegian cohort; median (IQR) of the pooled sample 13 (12.0) pgCALUXTEQ\/g lipid. Perinatal exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like compounds appeared associated with increased growth between 0 and 24months (adjusted estimate for change in z-score: \u03b2=0.07, 95% CI: -0.01, 0.14). At 7years, dioxins exposure was associated with a statistically significant increase in BMI in girls (adjusted estimate for BMI units \u03b2=0.49, 95% CI: 0.07, 0.91) but not in boys (\u03b2=-0.03, 95% CI: -0.55, 0.49) (p-interaction=0.044). Furthermore, girls had a 54% (-6%, 151%) increased risk of overweight at 7years (p-interaction=0.023).\nPerinatal exposure to dioxin and dioxin-like compounds was associated with increased early infant growth, and increased BMI in school age girls. Studies in larger sample sizes are required to confirm these sex-specific effects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027e3","authors":["Iszatt, Nina","Stigum, Hein","Govarts, Eva","Murinova, Lubica Palkovicova","Schoeters, Greet","Trnovec, Tomas","Legler, Juliette","Thomsen, Cathrine","Koppen, Gudrun","Eggesb\u00f8, Merete"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.envint.2016.04.040","endpage":"407","first_seen_on":"2016-06-20T16:41:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-6750","01604120"],"journal":"Environment International","last_mentioned_on":1474477863,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27311652","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0160412016301696"],"pmid":"27311652","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"399","subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Perinatal exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like compounds and infant growth and body mass index at seven years: A pooled analysis of three European birth cohorts","type":"article","volume":"94","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/perinatal-exposure-dioxins-dioxinlike-compounds-infant-growth-body-mass-index-seven-years-pooled-ana-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":6083848,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2029004,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266521,"mean":11.727875221371,"rank":169253,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":81623,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266521,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1390,"mean":10.536999280058,"rank":1130,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":219,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1390,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":6.4214814814815,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":3,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
