However, acquired chemoresistance is becoming the major challenges for patients, and the molecular mechanism underlying the development of 5-FU resistance is still poorly understood. In this study, a newly designed therapy in combination with 5-FU and NVP-BEZ235 in colon cancer cells (HCT-116 and RKO) was established, to investigate the mechanism of 5-FU resistance and optimize drug therapy to improve outcome for patients. Our results show 5-FU induced cell apoptosis through p53\/PUMA pathway, with aberrant Akt activation, which may well explain the mechanism of 5-FU resistance. NVP-BEZ235 effectively up-regulated PUMA expression, mainly through inactivation of PI3K\/Akt and activation of FOXO3a, leading to cell apoptosis even in the p53-\/- HCT-116 cells. Combination treatment of 5-FU and NVP-BEZ235 further increased cell apoptosis in a PUMA\/Bax dependent manner. Moreover, significantly enhanced anti-tumor effects were observed in combination treatment in vivo. Together, these results demonstrated that the combination treatment of 5-FU and NVP-BEZ235 caused PUMA-dependent tumor suppression both in vitro and in vivo, which may promise a more effective strategy for colon cancer therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Wang, Huanan","Zhang, Lingling","Yang, Xu","Jin, Yipeng","Pei, Shimin","Zhang, Di","Zhang, Hong","Zhou, Bin","Zhang, Yingjie","Lin, Degui"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.3775","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T12:10:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"issue":"16","journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1431511266,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25965911?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4546474","pmid":"25965911","pubdate":"2016-10-20T09:26:29+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"PUMA mediates the combinational therapy of 5-FU and NVP-BEZ235 in colon cancer.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/puma-mediates-combinational-therapy-5fu-nvpbez235-colon-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5094641,"mean":6.0369500922559,"rank":2691545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1738950,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5094641,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170528,"mean":9.024147237681,"rank":97147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":56620,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170528,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3876,"mean":1.5990601290323,"rank":1084,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":2314,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3876,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":225,"mean":1.2141964285714,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":225,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
