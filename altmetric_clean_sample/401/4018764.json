Sectonema septentrionale sp. n. is characterized by its 5.59-6.90 mm long body, lip region 25-29 \u03bcm broad and offset by deep constriction, mural tooth 18-19 \u03bcm long at its ventral side and occupying most of the stomatal lumen, pharyngeal expansion 618-926 \u03bcm long or 60-73% of total neck length, uterus tripartite and 370-493 \u03bcm long or 2.9-4.3 times the corresponding body diameter, V = 48-52, tail short and rounded (40-62 \u03bcm, c = 108-146, c' = 0.6-0.8), spicules 100-145 \u03bcm long, and 5-11 irregularly spaced ventromedian supplements with hiatus. It is very close to S. demani, but differs both in the nature of the mural tooth and of the uterus.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008daf","authors":["Pe\u00f1a-Santiago, Reyes","\u00c1lvarez-Ortega, Sergio"],"first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T14:02:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1175-5326"],"issue":"4","journal":"ZOOTAXA","last_mentioned_on":1431079566,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25947756?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25947756","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Description of Sectonema septentrionale sp. n.
