Three hundred forty-one students completed the 26-item pretest and posttest questionnaires (n = 166 for the intervention group, n = 175 for the control group). Results indicated a statistically significant increase in child abuse knowledge from pretest to posttest with the intervention group, with no change in knowledge for the control group. However, no significant increases occurred in efficacy expectations regarding abusive situations from pretest to posttest for either the intervention or control groups. Results from this study can be used to improve child abuse prevention programs through addressing program components that may affect factors other than student knowledge of abuse.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f10","authors":["Dake, Joseph A","Price, James H","Murnan, Judy"],"first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T14:52:24+00:00","issns":["0022-4391"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of School Health","last_mentioned_on":1430950424,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12643023"],"pmid":"12643023","pubdate":"2003-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nursing","healthservices"],"title":"Evaluation of a child abuse prevention curriculum for third-grade students: assessment of knowledge and efficacy expectations.","type":"article","volume":"73","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-child-abuse-prevention-curriculum-thirdgrade-students-assessment-knowledge-efficacy-expec"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5064898,"mean":6.0012989180247,"rank":1126361,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":3927748,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5064898,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169202,"mean":9.0231123811326,"rank":49666,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":118985,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169202,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":415,"mean":5.6532560386473,"rank":106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":308,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":415,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":6.675,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
