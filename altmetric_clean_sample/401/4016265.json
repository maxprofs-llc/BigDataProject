Confocal scanning laser microscopy (CLSM) showed highly directed bacterial alignment for two bacterial species (spherical and rod-shaped), reflecting the preferential orientation of the crystallite-air-water interfaces to give linear and triangular bacterial patterning. The mechanisms of bacterial attachment are demonstrated in terms of the balance between effective radial adhesional forces and the capillary forces resulting from the water contact angle of the bacteria at the three-phase line (TPL) of the lipid surface. It is suggested that these microtextured surfaces, which exhibit the ability to limit bacterial adhesion to a precise patterning at the lipid TPL, could be used as a means of controlling bacterial colonization.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d73cf058f610001226","authors":["Nguyen, Song Ha","Webb, Hayden K","Mainwaring, David E","Mahon, Peter J","Crawford, Russell J","Ivanova, Elena P","Song Ha Nguyen","Hayden K.
