Both are intermediates in combustion processes and play a role in the removal of nitrogen oxides from exhaust gases. The rovibronic structure of the first band in the TPES of HNCO(+) was analyzed within the framework of an orbital ionization model, and the resolved structure of the origin band was assigned to \u0394K subbands. An ionization energy of 11.602 \u00b1 0.005 eV was determined and the vibrational structure of the cationic ground state was analyzed by a Franck-Condon fit. Low lying electronically excited states of HNCO(+) were also observed. In a second series of experiments, the NCO radical was generated by flash pyrolysis from chlorine isocyanate. The ionization energy to the X(+) (3)\u03a3(-) ground state was determined to be 11.76 \u00b1 0.02 eV, while for the a(+) (1)\u0394 state, a value of 12.93 \u00b1 0.02 eV was obtained. Vibrational structure was observed for both states, and bands were assigned by Franck-Condon simulations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cee","authors":["Fabian Holzmeier","Fabian Holzmeier","Melanie Lang","Ingo Fischer","Xiaofeng Tang","Barbara Cunha de Miranda","Claire Romanzin","Christian Alcaraz","Patrick Hemberger"],"doi":"10.1063\/1.4920951","first_seen_on":"2015-05-19T14:23:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1089-7690"],"issue":"18","journal":"Journal of Chemical Physics","last_mentioned_on":1432018801,"links":["http:\/\/scitation.aip.org\/content\/aip\/journal\/jcp\/142\/18\/10.1063\/1.4920951"],"pmid":"25978890","pubdate":"2015-05-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"AIP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"title":"Threshold photoelectron spectroscopy of unstable N-containing compounds: Resolution of \u0394K subbands in HNCO+ and vibrational resolution in NCO+","type":"article","volume":"142","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/threshold-photoelectron-spectroscopy-unstable-ncontaining-compounds-resolution-%CE%B4k-subbands-hncosupsu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5119197,"mean":6.0597847724544,"rank":4258173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5119197,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170953,"mean":9.067632271047,"rank":141270,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170953,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4204,"mean":2.2975974304069,"rank":3340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4204,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201,"mean":1.21593,"rank":165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
