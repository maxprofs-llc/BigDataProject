We studied here the expression of Mip-1\u03b2 and the T cell maturation marker CD27 within CMVpp65-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in relation to age, HIV and active Tuberculosis (TB) co-infection in a cohort of Tanzanian volunteers (\u226416 years of age, n = 108 and \u226518 years, n = 79). Independent of HIV co-infection, IFN\u03b3+ CMVpp65-specific CD4+ T cell frequencies increased with age. In adults, HIV co-infection further increased the frequencies of these cells. A high capacity for Mip-1\u03b2 production together with a CD27low phenotype was characteristic for these cells in children and adults. Interestingly, in addition to HIV co-infection active TB disease was linked to further down regulation of CD27 and increased capacity of Mip-1\u03b2 production in CMVpp65-specific CD4+ T cells. These phenotypic and functional changes of CMVpp65-specific CD4 T cells observed during HIV infection and active TB could be associated with increased CMV reactivation rates.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Portevin, Damien","Moukambi, F\u00e9licien","Mpina, Maxmillian","Bauer, Asli","Haraka, Frederick","Chachage, Mkunde","Metzger, Philipp","Saathoff, Elmar","Clowes, Petra","Ntinginya, Nyanda E","Rachow, Andrea","Hoelscher, Michael","Reither, Klaus","Daubenberger, Claudia A","Geldmacher, Christof"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0126716","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T11:40:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"5","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1455803676,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25974183?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25974183?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25974183","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Maturation and Mip-1\u03b2 Production of Cytomegalovirus-Specific T Cell Responses in Tanzanian Children, Adolescents and Adults: Impact by HIV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis Co-Infections.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/maturation-mip1%CE%B2-production-cytomegalovirusspecific-t-cell-responses-tanzanian-children-adolescents"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7578098,"mean":6.5350293264878,"rank":5467042,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1842945,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7578098,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":215466,"mean":8.4377914835357,"rank":138998,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":63652,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":215466,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108021,"mean":10.207446880208,"rank":73459,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":29307,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108021,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6060,"mean":9.2560161742862,"rank":4254,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1459,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6060,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
