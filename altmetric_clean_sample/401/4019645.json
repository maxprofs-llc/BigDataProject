A cluster analysis of impulsiveness measured by the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale - Version 11 (BIS-11) was performed on a sample of hands-on child molesters.\nThe sample consisted of 208 child molesters enrolled in two different sectional studies carried out in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Using three factors from the BIS-11, a k-means cluster analysis was performed using the average silhouette width to determine cluster number. Direct logistic regression was performed to analyze the association of criminological and clinical features with the resulting clusters.\nTwo clusters were delineated. The cluster characterized by higher impulsiveness showed higher scores on the Sexual Screening for Pedophilic Interests (SSPI), Static-99, and Sexual Addiction Screening Test.\nGiven that child molesters are an extremely heterogeneous population, the \"number of victims\" item of the SSPI should call attention to those offenders with the highest motor, attentional, and non-planning impulsiveness. Our findings could have implications in terms of differences in therapeutic management for these two groups, with the most impulsive cluster benefitting from psychosocial strategies combined with pharmacological interventions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5323cf058f6100044ca","authors":["Baltieri, Danilo A","Boer, Douglas P","Baltieri, Danilo A.","Boer, Douglas P."],"doi":"10.1590\/1516-4446-2014-1568","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T14:47:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1809-452X","1516-4446"],"issue":"ahead","journal":"Revista Brasileira de Psiquiatria","last_mentioned_on":1462762903,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25946400","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25946400","http:\/\/www.scielo.br\/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1516-44462015000200139#.WZiPSRtk0IQ.twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.scielo.br\/pdf\/rbp\/v37n2\/1516-4446-rbp-1516-4446-2014-1568.pdf","pmid":"25946400","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Psiquiatria (ABP)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Two clusters of child molesters based on impulsiveness.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/two-clusters-child-molesters-based-impulsiveness"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8249251,"mean":6.9705214427913,"rank":3898426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4167278,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8249251,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":219271,"mean":8.6900378984815,"rank":100145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":111374,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":219271,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":1.39,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":2.85,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
