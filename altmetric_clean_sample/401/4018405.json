EDI-OCT imaged all tumors as smooth with a gently sloping anterior contour, gradual choroidal expansion, expansion of medium and large size choroidal vessels without compression of choriocapillaris, and intact Bruch's membrane (n = 10, 100%). The height of the medium and large choroidal vessels within the tumor compared to normal medium and large vessels was comparatively increased by a mean of 265% (medium vessels) and 576% (large vessels). Outer retinal abnormalities included subretinal fluid (n = 7, 70%), lipofuscin deposition (n = 1, 10%), irregularity and thinning of retinal pigment epithelium and absence or irregularity of the ellipsoid layer (n = 4, 40%), absent external limiting membrane (n = 2, 20%), and disruption of the outer nuclear layer and outer plexiform layer (n = 3, 30%). The inner retinal abnormalities included irregularity of inner nuclear layer and structural loss or edema of inner plexiform layer (n = 3, 30%). The ganglion cell layer and nerve fiber layer were intact (n = 10, 100%).\nEDI-OCT of circumscribed choroidal hemangiomas depicts a smooth, gently sloping choroidal mass with expansion of medium and large size choroidal vessels without compression of the choriocapillaris. Structural abnormalities of outer and inner retinal layers were noted.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f61000420c","authors":["Rojanaporn, Duangnate","Kaliki, Swathi","Ferenczy, Sandor R","Shields, Carol L"],"doi":"10.4103\/0974-9233.150629","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T13:46:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0975-1599"],"issue":"2","journal":"Middle East African Journal of Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1439032350,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25949077?dopt=Abstract#pubmed","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25949077?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25949077","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography of circumscribed choroidal hemangioma in 10 consecutive cases.","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/enhanced-depth-imaging-optical-coherence-tomography-circumscribed-choroidal-hemangioma-10-consecutiv-7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5462004,"mean":6.3513590516133,"rank":2712477,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2584863,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5462004,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177716,"mean":9.0668109838788,"rank":92672,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":77516,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177716,"percentile":43},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138,"mean":1.2507299270073,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":85,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"PE":1,"IN":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/OCTMD\/status\/596656858368184320","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4018405],"posted_on":"2015-05-08T12:44:15+00:00","author":{"name":"Brandon Lujan, MD","url":"http:\/\/OCTMD.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/459117248297189376\/n_gr2d1r_normal.jpeg","description":"Medical Retina and Imaging Specialist with Expertise in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT).","id_on_source":"OCTMD","tweeter_id":"244660420","geo":{"lt":37.77493,"ln":-122.41942,"country":"US"},"followers":1320},"tweet_id":"596656858368184320"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/campos2075\/status\/600949966715125760","license":"datasift","rt":["OCTMD"],"citation_ids":[4018405],"posted_on":"2015-05-20T09:03:31+00:00","author":{"name":"eric campos","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/569360927364251648\/ucN7O-Im_normal.jpeg","description":"oftalm\u00f3logo","id_on_source":"campos2075","tweeter_id":"1324768956","geo":{"lt":-8.11599,"ln":-79.02998,"country":"PE"},"followers":610},"tweet_id":"600949966715125760"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/InOncology\/status\/629973453840355328","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4018405],"posted_on":"2015-08-08T11:12:30+00:00","author":{"name":"India Oncology 2.0","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/InOncology\/149384831739338","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1075687841\/12_normal.png","description":"The Latest in Oncology","id_on_source":"InOncology","tweeter_id":"166079744","geo":{"lt":20,"ln":77,"country":"IN"},"followers":134},"tweet_id":"629973453840355328"}]}}
