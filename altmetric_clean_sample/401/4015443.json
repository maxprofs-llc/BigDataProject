The aim of this study was to assess the effects of exposure to jet engine noise on technical staff hearing.\nThe study comprised 60 men, aged 24-50 years, employed in army as technical staff and exposed to jet engine noise for 6-20 years. The control group were 50 non-noise exposed males, aged 25-51 years. Exposure to noise emitted by jet engines was evaluated. Pure-tone audiometry (PTA) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) were recorded in both groups.\nJet engines emitted broadband noise with spectrum dominated by components in the frequency range 315-6300 Hz (1\/3-octave bands). Maximum A-weighted SPL during tests reached values of approx. 120-130 dB. Consequently, engine-servicing personnel (even in the case of a single engine test) was exposed to noise (at A-weighted daily noise exposure level above 95 dB) exceeding permissible levels. Averaged audiometric hearing threshold levels of technical staff were higher (\u2264 17 dB HL, p < 0.001) than in the control group. Similarly, the DPOAE amplitude was lower (\u2264 17 dB SPL, p < 0.01) in the noise-exposed subjects compared to the non-exposed ones. Significant reduction of DPOAE levels was mainly noted for high frequencies (3-6 kHz).\nDespite the usage of hearing protection devices, both PTA and DPOAE consistently showed poorer hearing in engine-servicing personnel vs. control group.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f61000602a","authors":["Konopka, Wies\u0142aw","Pawlaczyk-Luszczy\u0144ska, Ma\u0142gorzata","\u015aliwi\u0144ska-Kowalska, Mariola"],"first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T11:50:29+00:00","issns":["0465-5893"],"issue":"5","journal":"Medycyna Pracy","last_mentioned_on":1431629254,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25812386"],"pmid":"25812386","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"The influence of jet engine noise on hearing of technical staff.","type":"article","volume":"65","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-jet-engine-noise-hearing-technical-staff"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5098110,"mean":6.0408362802768,"rank":2693466,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1740119,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5098110,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170671,"mean":9.0209674928225,"rank":97229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":56669,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170671,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":1.4811320754717,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
