Of those, 67\u00a0patients had the port access approach, and 342 had the\u00a0redo sternotomy approach. Of the latter, 220 met the\u00a0inclusion criteria because emergencies, patients with\u00a0endocarditis, and those requiring concomitant procedures involving aortic valve and aorta were excluded.\nNew York Heart Association class 2 or above, age, atrial fibrillation, and surgical indications were similar in both groups. The port access group had more patients with previous MV repair (78% [n\u00a0= 52] vs 41%\u00a0[n\u00a0= 90], p < 0.01) than with MV replacement (19% [n\u00a0= 13) vs 53% [n\u00a0= 116], p < 0.01). Concomitant procedures were similar (20% [n\u00a0= 14] vs 27% [n\u00a0= 59], p\u00a0= 0.4). The MV re-repair rates were similar (19% [n\u00a0= 10] vs 22% [n\u00a0= 20], p\u00a0= 1). The cardiopulmonary bypass times (153 \u00b1 42 minutes vs 172 \u00b1 83 minutes, p\u00a0= 0.07) and aortic cross-clamping times (104 \u00b1 38 minutes versus 130 \u00b1 71 minutes, p < 0.01) were lower in the port access group. Mortality was lower in the port access group, although not significantly (3.0% [n\u00a0= 2] vs 6.0% [n\u00a0= 13], p\u00a0= 0.5). The rates of postoperative stroke were similar (3.0% [n\u00a0= 2] vs 3.2% [n\u00a0= 7], p\u00a0= 1). On postoperative echocardiography, freedom from mitral regurgitation >2+ was 100% in the port access group and 99% in the redo sternotomy group. The mean hospital length of stay was 11 \u00b1 15 days versus 14 \u00b1 12 days (p\u00a0= 0.07).\nThe port access approach can be safely adopted for reoperations on the MV without compromising postoperative mortality or MV function.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a35","authors":["Vallabhajosyula, Prashanth","Wallen, Tyler","Pulsipher, Aaron","Pitkin, Emil","Solometo, Lauren P","Musthaq, Shenara","Fox, Jeanne","Acker, Michael","Hargrove, W Clark"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.athoracsur.2015.02.039","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T11:21:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1552-6259"],"journal":"The Annals of Thoracic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1431772115,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25975939?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25975939","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Minimally Invasive Port Access Approach for\u00a0Reoperations on the Mitral Valve.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/minimally-invasive-port-access-approach-reoperations-mitral-valve"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5104077,"mean":6.0451768727597,"rank":4245006,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5104077,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170787,"mean":9.0206843183869,"rank":140959,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170787,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2415,"mean":2.4486288318144,"rank":1355,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2415,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":1.6985507246377,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
