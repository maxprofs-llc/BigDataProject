Reuptake of extracellular A\u03b2 is believed to contribute significantly to the intraneuronal A\u03b2 pool in the early stages of AD. Published reports have claimed that the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) mediates A\u03b21-42 uptake and lysosomal trafficking in GT1-7 neuronal cells and mouse embryonic fibroblast non-neuronal cells. However, there is no direct evidence supporting the role of LRP1 in A\u03b2 internalization in primary neurons. Our recent study indicated that p38 MAPK and ERK1\/2 signaling pathways are involved in regulating \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (\u03b17nAChR)-mediated A\u03b21-42 uptake in SH-SY5Y cells. This study was designed to explore the regulation of MAPK signaling pathways on LRP1-mediated A\u03b2 internalization in neurons. We found that extracellular A\u03b21-42 oligomers could be internalized into endosomes\/lysosomes and mitochondria in cortical neurons. A\u03b21-42 and LRP1 were also found co-localized in neurons during A\u03b21-42 internalization, and they could form A\u03b21-42-LRP1 complex. Knockdown of LRP1 expression significantly decreased neuronal A\u03b21-42 internalization. Finally, we identified that p38 MAPK and ERK1\/2 signaling pathways regulated the internalization of A\u03b21-42 via LRP1. Therefore, these results demonstrated that LRP1, p38 MAPK and ERK1\/2 mediated the internalization of A\u03b21-42 in neurons and provided evidence that blockade of LRP1 or inhibitions of MAPK signaling pathways might be a potential approach to lowering brain A\u03b2 levels and served a potential therapeutic target for AD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b26","authors":["Yang, Wei-Na","Ma, Kai-Ge","Qian, Yi-Hua","Zhang, Jian-Shui","Feng, Gai-Feng","Shi, Li-Li","Zhang, Zhi-Chao","Liu, Zhao-Hui"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.biocel.2015.04.013","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T14:50:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1878-5875"],"journal":"International Journal of Biochemistry & Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1457833053,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25936756?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25936756"],"pmid":"25936756","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways promote low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1-mediated internalization of beta-amyloid protein in primary cortical neurons.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mitogenactivated-protein-kinase-signaling-pathways-promote-lowdensity-lipoprotein-receptorrelated-pr-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7386232,"mean":6.4185596659474,"rank":662626,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":6717467,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7386232,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":213548,"mean":8.4203312338737,"rank":28282,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":184897,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":213548,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1059,"mean":3.6005349716446,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":1028,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1059,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":1.7519285714286,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"US":1},"mendeley":{"PE":1,"ID":1}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways promote low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1-mediated internalization of beta-amyloid protein in primary cortical neurons.","url":"http:\/\/www.alzforum.org\/papers\/mitogen-activated-protein-kinase-signaling-pathways-promote-low-density-lipoprotein-receptor","license":"public","citation_ids":[4019726],"posted_on":"2015-05-15T00:00:00+00:00","summary":"Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2015 Apr 29; Authors: Yang WN, Ma KG, Qian YH, Zhang JS, Feng GF, Shi LL, Zhang ZC, Liu ZH PubMed: 25936756 Submit Comment","author":{"name":"Alzforum","url":"http:\/\/www.alzforum.org","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/001\/355\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2015-04-08_at_12.16.09_1.png?1428491784"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeuroGen_papers\/status\/596165330851868672","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4019726],"posted_on":"2015-05-07T04:11:05+00:00","author":{"name":"NeuroGenetics papers","url":"http:\/\/neurogeneticslab.wordpress.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/508573077727223808\/P7-OnZSA_normal.png","description":"Twitterbot from @TheGBLab!
