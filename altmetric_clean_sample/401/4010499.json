It was postulated that its nucleoid and chromosome(s) organization could participate in the DNA double strand break repair process. Here, we investigated the organization of chromosome 1 by localization of three chromosomal loci including oriC, Ter and a locus located in its left arm. For this purpose, we used a ParB-parS system to visualize the position of the loci before and after exposure to \u03b3-rays. By comparing the number of fluorescent foci with the number of copies of the studied loci present in the cells measured by qPCR, we demonstrated that the four to ten copies of chromosome 1 per cell are dispersed within the nucleoid before irradiation, indicating that the chromosome copies are not prealigned. Chromosome segregation is progressive, but not coordinated, allowing each locus to be paired with its sister during part of the cell cycle. After irradiation, the nucleoid organization is modified, involving a transient alignment of the loci in the late stage of DNA repair and a delay of segregation of the Ter locus. We discuss how these events can influence DNA double strand break repair.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f610003118","authors":["Passot, Fanny Marie","Nguyen, Hong Ha","Dard\u2010Dascot, Cloelia","Thermes, Claude","Servant, Pascale","Esp\u00e9li, Olivier","Sommer, Suzanne","Dard-Dascot, Cloelia"],"doi":"10.1111\/mmi.13064","endpage":"774","first_seen_on":"2015-05-19T14:15:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1365-2958"],"issue":"4","journal":"Molecular Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1464441515,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/mmi.13064\/abstract;jsessionid=8D37AC361EC6EFCDE6E9CC353A7EE438.f01t03","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25988355?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/mmi.13064\/pdf","pmid":"25988355","pubdate":"2015-05-20T22:01:33+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"759","subjects":["molecularbiology","microbiology"],"title":"Nucleoid Organization in the Radioresistant Bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans","type":"article","volume":"97","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nucleoid-organization-radioresistant-bacterium-deinococcus-radiodurans"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7822782,"mean":6.6331385505942,"rank":5933308,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1046939,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7822782,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":216574,"mean":8.5289418994982,"rank":152898,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":33278,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":216574,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2567,"mean":3.1617466874513,"rank":2194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2567,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":3.2080294117647,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
