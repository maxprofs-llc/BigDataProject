As such, male and female rats were administered with a pegylated leptin antagonist on PND9 and the expression of neurons, glial cells and diverse markers of synaptic plasticity were then analyzed by immunohistochemistry in the hippocampal formation. Antagonism of the actions of leptin at this specific postnatal stage altered the number of GFAP positive cells, CB1 cannabinoid receptors, synaptophysin and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), with this latter effect being sexually dimorphic. The results indicate that the physiological leptin surge occurring around PND 9-10 is critical for hippocampal formation development and that the dynamics of leptin activity might be different in males and females. The data obtained also suggest that some but not all the previously reported effects of maternal deprivation on hippocampal formation development (which markedly reduces leptin levels at PND 9-10) might be mediated by the leptin deficiency in these animals.
