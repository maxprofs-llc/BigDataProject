The objective of this study was to examine excess total healthcare expenditures associated with depression among individuals with osteoarthritis in the US.\nAdults with self-reported osteoarthritis (n\u2009=\u20091881) were identified using data from the 2010 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). Among those with osteoarthritis, chi-square tests and ordinary least square regressions (OLS) were used to examine differences in healthcare expenditures between those with and without depression. Post-regression linear decomposition technique was used to estimate the relative contribution of different constructs of the Anderson's behavioral model, i.e., predisposing, enabling, need, personal healthcare practices, and external environment factors, to the excess expenditures associated with depression among individuals with osteoarthritis. All analysis accounted for the complex survey design of MEPS.\nDepression coexisted among 20.6\u00a0% of adults with osteoarthritis. The average total healthcare expenditures were $13,684 among adults with depression compared to $9284 among those without depression. Multivariable OLS regression revealed that adults with depression had 38.8\u00a0% higher healthcare expenditures (p\u2009<\u20090.001) compared to those without depression. Post-regression linear decomposition analysis indicated that 50\u00a0% of differences in expenditures among adults with and without depression can be explained by differences in need factors.\nAmong individuals with coexisting osteoarthritis and depression, excess healthcare expenditures associated with depression were mainly due to comorbid anxiety, chronic conditions and poor health status. These expenditures may potentially be reduced by providing timely intervention for need factors or by providing care under a collaborative care model.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c43","authors":["Parul Agarwal","Usha Sambamoorthi"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11606-015-3393-4","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T08:18:40+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms"],"issns":["1525-1497"],"journal":"JGIM: Journal of General Internal Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1432167145,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s11606-015-3393-4","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s11606-015-3393-4?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs11606-015-3393-4.pdf","pmid":"25990191","pubdate":"2015-05-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["internalmedicine"],"title":"Healthcare Expenditures Associated with Depression Among Individuals with Osteoarthritis: Post-Regression Linear Decomposition Approach","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/healthcare-expenditures-associated-depression-among-individuals-osteoarthritis-postregression-linear"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5124740,"mean":6.0645075040905,"rank":3598723,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":862425,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5124740,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171253,"mean":9.0221689907272,"rank":122635,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":29886,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171253,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2395,"mean":8.6270292397661,"rank":1862,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":247,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2395,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121,"mean":13.060466666667,"rank":84,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
