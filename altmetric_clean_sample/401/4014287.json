While the symptoms were similar in most pine stands, the disease was diagnosed as Canavirgella banfieldii in several locations and Dooks needle blight caused by Lophophacidium dooksii in others. Because of the similarities in symptom development and morphological characters of the causal agents, it was suspected that C. banfieldii and L. dooksii are either the same or closely related species. To test this hypothesis we examined several collections representing C. banfieldii and L. dooksii, including the two type specimens. Phylogenetic analyses of nuc internal transcribed spacer rDNA sequences confirm the synonymy of C. banfieldii with the earlier described L. dooksii and provide the first evidence of the close evolutionary relationship of L. dooksii to other pine pathogens.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f61000313d","authors":["Laflamme, Gaston","Broders, Kirk D","C\u00f4t\u00e9, Chantal","Munck, Isabel","Iriarte, Gloria","Innes, Louise"],"doi":"10.3852\/14-096","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T11:17:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0027-5514"],"journal":"Mycologia","last_mentioned_on":1431788914,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25977210?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25977210","pubdate":"2015-05-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Priority of Lophophacidium over Canavirgella: taxonomic status of Lophophacidium dooksii and Canavirgella banfieldii, causal agents of a white pine needle disease.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/priority-lophophacidium-canavirgella-taxonomic-status-lophophacidium-dooksii-canavirgella-banfieldii"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5104077,"mean":6.0451768727597,"rank":4245006,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5104077,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170786,"mean":9.0207356735078,"rank":140959,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170786,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1256,"mean":3.0486119521912,"rank":1184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1256,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":2.1176470588235,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
