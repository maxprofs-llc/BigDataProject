Comprising a distinctive geographic region spread across West Asia and North East Africa and unified by the Arabic language, these states share common values and characteristics despite having diverse economic and political conditions. The demographic lag (high fertility and low mortality) that characterizes the Arab world is unique, but the present trend of declining fertility, combined with the relatively low mortality, brings about significant changes in its population size. This research aimed to: (i) assess the population growth in the Arab world over 3 time periods, (ii) explore its components, and (iii) understand its public health impact. Data from the International Data Base (IDB) of the U.S. Census Bureau for 3 time periods (1992, 2002, and 2012) in 21 countries of the Arab world were analyzed by dividing them into four geographic sectors, namely, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), West Asia, Maghreb, and the Nile Valley African Horn. The population of the Arab world has grown considerably due to both natural growth and migration. The immigration is pronounced, especially into resource-intensive GCC nations, not only from East Asian and Central African countries but also from resource-thrifty (limited-resource) Arab nations. The migrations within, as well as outside, the Arab world reveal an interesting demographic phenomenon that requires further research: migration flows and trends. However, the transformations in public health statistics related to mortality-the impact of demographic changes-depict a new era in the Arab world.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Asharaf Abdul Salam","Ibrahim Elsegaey","Rshood Khraif","Abdullah AlMutairi","Ali Aldosari"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0124944","first_seen_on":"2015-05-19T23:47:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"5","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1435921214,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0124944"],"pmid":"25993053","pubdate":"2015-05-18T07:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Components and Public Health Impact of Population Growth in the Arab World","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/components-public-health-impact-population-growth-arab-world-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8456380,"mean":7.1056554250859,"rank":3679091,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4655758,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8456380,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":220197,"mean":8.7667567439918,"rank":88350,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":127451,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":220197,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116457,"mean":10.679493628495,"rank":49408,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":64220,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116457,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6133,"mean":9.7559598825832,"rank":2665,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6133,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
