However, the function of NRP1 in melanoma progression, as well as the effect of NRP1 expression on the prognosis of patients with melanoma remains unknown. In the present study, NRP1 expression was examined in 460\u00a0cases of melanocytic lesions (28\u00a0common nevi, 51\u00a0dysplastic nevi, 250\u00a0primary melanoma and 131\u00a0metastatic melanoma) at different stages, using a tissue microarray. The correlation of NRP1 expression with melanoma progression, and its prognostic value in patients with melanoma was examined. In addition, the correlation between matrix metalloproteinase\u00a02 (MMP2) and NRP1 expression in patients with melanoma was analyzed. The results demonstrated that NRP1 expression was significantly increased in primary\u00a0(56%) and metastatic melanoma\u00a0(62%), compared with common nevi\u00a0(11%) and dysplastic nevi\u00a0(24%). Notably, increased NRP1 expression was correlated with a poorer overall, and disease\u2011specific, 10\u2011year survival (P=0.03 and P=0.002, respectively). Multivariate Cox regression analyses indicated that NRP1 is an independent prognostic marker for melanoma. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation between NRP1 and MMP2 expression in melanoma biopsies was observed, and their concomitant expression was closely correlated with melanoma patient survival, further supporting the hypothesis that the expression of NRP1 is associated with melanoma invasion and metastasis. In conclusion, increased NRP1 expression is associated with disease progression and reduced survival in patients with melanoma, and is a promising prognostic molecular marker for this disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c8","authors":["Lu, Jing","Cheng, Yabin","Zhang, Guohong","Tang, Yun","Dong, Ziming","McElwee, Kevin J","Li, Gang"],"doi":"10.3892\/mmr.2015.3752","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T13:05:33+00:00","funders":["niehs","cihr"],"issns":["1791-3004"],"journal":"Molecular Medicine Reports","last_mentioned_on":1457695955,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25954957?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25954957?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25954957","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Increased expression of neuropilin\u00a01 in melanoma progression and its prognostic significance in patients with melanoma.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increased-expression-neuropilin1-melanoma-progression-prognostic-significance-patients-melanoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7380153,"mean":6.4120828327074,"rank":3575980,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":3617667,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7380153,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":213495,"mean":8.4187757126665,"rank":106261,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":98292,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":213495,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1698,"mean":1.4614566882734,"rank":228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":1387,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1698,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145,"mean":0.91493055555556,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
