(Sapindaceae) is an endemic West African plant that is extensively used in traditional medicine to treat various diseases. Previous phytochemical analysis by various groups led to the isolation of several novel lupene-based triterpenene derivatives along with other classes of compounds. As part of our continued phytochemical studies on the roots of this plant, we have now identified yet another novel triterpene, 6a-(3'-methoxy-4'-hydroxybenzoyl)-lup-20(29)-ene-3-one. The identification of the compound through comprehensive spectroscopic studies is discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9283cf058f61000dd23","authors":["Jackson, Nora","Annan, Kofi","Mensah, Abraham Y","Ekuadzi, Edmund","Mensah, Merlin L K","Habtemariam, Solomon"],"first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T11:46:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1934-578X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Natural product communications","last_mentioned_on":1431684455,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25973476?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25973476","pubdate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","botany","pharmacology"],"title":"A novel triterpene from the roots of Paullinia pinnata: 6\u03b1-(3'-methoxy-4'-hydroxybenzoyl)-lup-20(29)-ene-3-one.","type":"article","volume":"10"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5099351,"mean":6.0430677784442,"rank":4241397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5099351,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170696,"mean":9.0210429948154,"rank":140891,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170696,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":376,"mean":1.6196586666667,"rank":195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":376,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":0.75833333333333,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/RootPapers\/status\/599154148018229248","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4015351],"posted_on":"2015-05-15T10:07:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Root Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/447736797422813184\/Q7OqMgVA_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Plant Root papers in #PubMed, #arXiv, #Bioarxiv and #PeerJ Preprints.
