Reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a major cause of DNA damage that correlates with cancer initiation and progression. Glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3), the only known extracellular glycosylated enzyme of GPXs, is a major scavenger of ROS. GPX3 has been identified as a tumor suppressor in many cancers. However, the role of GPX3 in ccRCC remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate its epigenetic alteration in ccRCC and possible clinicopathological association. In our study, GPX3 methylation and down-regulation were detected in 5 out of 6 ccRCC cell lines and the GPX3 mRNA and protein expression level in ccRCC tumors was significantly lower than in adjacent non-malignant renal tissues (p < 0.0001). Treatment with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored GPX3 expression in ccRCC cells. Aberrant methylation was further detected in 77.1% (162\/210) of RCC primary tumors, but only 14.6% (7\/48) in adjacent non-malignant renal tissues. GPX3 methylation status was significantly associated with higher tumor nuclear grade (p = 0.014). Thus, our results showing frequent GPX3 inactivation by promoter hypermethylation in ccRCC may reveal the failure in the cellular antioxidant system in ccRCC and may be associated with renal tumorigenesis. GPX3 tumor specific methylation may serve as a biomarker for early detection and prognosis prediction of ccRCC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e6e","authors":["Liu, Qianling","Jin, Jie","Ying, Jianming","Sun, Mengkui","Cui, Yun","Zhang, Lian","Xu, Ben","Fan, Yu","Zhang, Qian"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijms160510636","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T11:29:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1422-0067"],"issue":"5","journal":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1431715204,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25970749?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25970749","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Frequent epigenetic suppression of tumor suppressor gene glutathione peroxidase 3 by promoter hypermethylation and its clinical implication in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/frequent-epigenetic-suppression-tumor-suppressor-gene-glutathione-peroxidase-3-promoter-hypermethyla"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5099351,"mean":6.0430677784442,"rank":4241397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5099351,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170696,"mean":9.0210429948154,"rank":140891,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170696,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2766,"mean":1.9032491862568,"rank":1901,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2766,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176,"mean":1.7980114285714,"rank":128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
