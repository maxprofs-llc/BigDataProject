To date, the OSL-MLEM method has been evaluated using kinetic models based on two-tissue compartments with an irreversible component. We extend the evaluation of this method for two-tissue compartments with a reversible component, using SRTM-BFM on simulated 3D + time data sets (with use of [(11)C]raclopride time-activity curves from real data) and on real data sets acquired with the high resolution research tomograph. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by comparing voxel-level binding potential (BPND) estimates with those obtained from conventional post-reconstruction kinetic parameter estimation. For the commonly chosen number of iterations used in practice, our results show that for the 3D + time simulation, the direct method delivers results with lower (%)RMSE at the normal count level (decreases of 9-10 percentage points, corresponding to a 38-44% reduction), and also at low count levels (decreases of 17-21 percentage points, corresponding to a 26-36% reduction). As for the real 3D data set, the results obtained follow a similar trend, with the direct reconstruction method offering a 21% decrease in (%)CV compared to the post reconstruction method at low count levels. Thus, based on the results presented herein, using the SRTM-BFM kinetic model in conjunction with the OSL-MLEM direct 4D PET MLEM reconstruction method offers an improvement in performance when compared to conventional post reconstruction methods.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000330e","authors":["Paul Gravel","Andrew J Reader"],"doi":"10.1088\/0031-9155\/60\/11\/4533","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T14:57:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0031-9155","1361-6560"],"issue":"11","journal":"Physics in Medicine & Biology","last_mentioned_on":1432655412,"links":["http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/0031-9155\/60\/11\/4533","http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/0031-9155\/60\/11\/4533\/email-alert\/1144155663"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/0031-9155\/60\/11\/4533\/pdf\/0031-9155_60_11_4533.pdf","pmid":"25992999","pubdate":"2015-05-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"IOP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["biophysics","biology"],"title":"Direct 4D PET MLEM reconstruction of parametric images using the simplified reference tissue model with the basis function method for [11C]raclopride","type":"article","volume":"60"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5148643,"mean":6.0868263786862,"rank":3615403,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":867322,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5148643,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171694,"mean":9.0216184119331,"rank":122917,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":29990,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171694,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":924,"mean":2.0991635969664,"rank":697,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":924,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103,"mean":1.4088235294118,"rank":101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/medphyspapers\/status\/601038892293353472","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4019868],"posted_on":"2015-05-20T14:56:53+00:00","author":{"name":"Med Phys Papers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","description":"New publications in Medical Physics and Radiotherapy.","id_on_source":"medphyspapers","tweeter_id":"2879791906","geo":{"lt":54.75844,"ln":-2.69531,"country":"GB"},"followers":137},"tweet_id":"601038892293353472"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Ihbercha\/status\/603226638789120000","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4019868],"posted_on":"2015-05-26T15:50:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Ishtiaq H.
