However, inadequate immunogenicity and low bioavailability limit the clinical uses of this agent. In a previous study, we first produced an improved HSP70.PC\u2011based vaccine purified from dendritic cell (DC)-tumor fusion cells (HSP70.PC-Fc) which had increased immunogenicity due to enhanced antigenic tumor peptides compared to HSP70.PC-Tu. In order to increase the bioavailability of HSP70.PC-Fc, the peptide complex was encapsulated with nanoliposomes (NL-HSP70.PC-Fc) in this study. After encapsulation, the tumor immunogenicity was observed using various assays. It was demonstrated that the NL-HSP70.PC-Fc has acceptable stability. The in\u00a0vivo antitumor immune response was increased with regard to T-cell activation, CTL response and tumor therapy efficiency compared to that of HSP70.PC-Fc. In addition, it was shown that DC maturation was improved by NL-HSP70.PC-Fc, which added to the antitumor immunity. The results obtained for NL-HSP70.PC-Fc, which improved immunogenicity and increases the bioavailability of HSP70.PC, may represent superior heat shock proteins\u00a0(HSPs)-based tumor vaccines. Such vaccines deserve further investigation and may provide a preclinical rationale to translate findings into early phase trials for patients with breast tumors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f61000837e","authors":["Zhang, Yunfei","Luo, Wen","Wang, Yucai","Chen, Jun","Liu, Yunyan","Zhang, Yong"],"doi":"10.3892\/or.2015.3934","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T11:57:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1791-2431"],"issue":"6","journal":"Oncology Reports","last_mentioned_on":1454672196,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25963968?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25963968","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Enhanced antitumor immunity of nanoliposome-encapsulated heat shock protein 70 peptide complex derived from dendritic tumor fusion cells.","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/enhanced-antitumor-immunity-nanoliposomeencapsulated-heat-shock-protein-70-peptide-complex-derived-d"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7103144,"mean":6.3016585108842,"rank":3120391,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3822364,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7103144,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":212411,"mean":8.3739192316747,"rank":95443,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":109457,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":212411,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1416,"mean":1.6643929328622,"rank":341,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":1048,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1416,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":0.56615384615385,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":61,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Computer Science":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Mathematics":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TumorImm_papers\/status\/598517195795079169","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4015622],"posted_on":"2015-05-13T15:56:34+00:00","author":{"name":"TumorImmunoPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/741322452093931520\/rQvFtFTA_normal.jpg","description":"A TwitterBot for Cancer Immunology and Tolerance papers on #PubMed.
