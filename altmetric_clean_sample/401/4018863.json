They are known to be key players in the induction and maintenance of allergic asthma by cross-linking innate and adaptive immune responses. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to influence cell fate and function by translational suppression or induction of messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation. miR-155 has been shown to be a crucial regulator of the immune system. However, its function in the pathogenesis of allergic airway inflammation (AAI) is not completely elucidated yet.\nWildtype (WT) and miR-155 deficient (miR-155(-\/-) ) mice were used in ovalbumin (OVA) and house dust mite (HDM) models of AAI. Adoptive transfer of sensitized DCs to the lungs, migration and T cell priming assays were used to investigate the functional relevance of miR-155 in DCs.\nmiR-155(-\/-) mice showed reduced eosinophilic airway inflammation compared to WT mice in both models of AAI. Furthermore, miR-155(-\/-) DCs showed limited Th2 priming capacity and failed to induce airway inflammation in allergen exposed WT mice. miR-155 deficiency on DCs was also associated with impaired purinergic receptor signaling, since miR-155(-\/-) DCs showed reduced chemotaxis and IL-1beta secretion upon stimulation with ATP, probably due to direct targeting of ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (E-NTPD) by miR-155.\nmiR-155 deficiency alleviates AAI by diminishing Th2 priming capacity and ATP\/P2R-induced activation of DCs in mice, suggesting this miRNA as a potential therapeutic target of AAI.
