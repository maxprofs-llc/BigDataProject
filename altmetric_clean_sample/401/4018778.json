The pathogen possesses an array of virulence factors which aid in tissue adhesion, invasion and host cell injury. Although the identification and validation of C. sakazakii virulence factors has been hindered by availability of suitable neonatal animal model, various studies has reported outer membrane protein A (ompA) as a potential virulence marker. Various other plasmid associated genes such as filamentous hemagglutinin (fhaBC), Cronobacter plasminogen activator (cpa) and genes responsible for iron acquisition (eitCBAD and iucABD\/iutA) have been reported in different strains of C. sakazakii. Besides these proposed virulence factors, several biophysical growth factors such as formation of biofilms and resistance to various environmental stresses also contributes to the pathogenic potential of this pathogen. This review provides an update on virulence determinants associated with the pathogenesis of C. sakazakii. The potential reservoirs of the pathogen, mode of transmission and epidemiology are also discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc8b","authors":["Singh, Niharika","Goel, Gunjan","Raghav, Mamta"],"doi":"10.1080\/21505594.2015.1036217","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T14:03:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2150-5608"],"journal":"Virulence","last_mentioned_on":1431079565,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25950947?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25950947","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Insights into virulence factors determining the pathogenicity of Cronobacter sakazakii.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/insights-virulence-factors-determining-pathogenicity-cronobacter-sakazakii"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5067960,"mean":6.0028018028568,"rank":4215997,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5067960,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169687,"mean":9.0181039449337,"rank":139989,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169687,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":274,"mean":3.3046007326007,"rank":204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":274,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.98636363636364,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
