The infection rate varied with the animal species from 1.6 to 92.8%. Analysis of the taxonomic affiliation of Trichinella isolated from the muscles of the terrestrial and marine mammals indicated that the Trichinella species T. nativa was widespread in the arctic areas of the Russian Federation. Analysis of sequences in the Cob gene of mtDNA revealed nucleotide differences between several isolates of this species.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9253cf058f61000dcac","authors":["Odoevskaia, I M","Bukina, L A","Khiliuta, N V","Spiridonov, S \u00c9"],"first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T13:13:20+00:00","issns":["0025-8326"],"issue":"3","journal":"Meditsinskaia parazitologiia i parazitarnye bolezni","last_mentioned_on":1431180608,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25924274?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25924274","pubdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"[Molecular taxonomic identification of Trichinella spp. from the Arctic coasts of the Russian Federation].","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-taxonomic-identification-trichinella-spp-arctic-coasts-russian-federation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5068387,"mean":6.0044174686005,"rank":2676639,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1730417,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5068387,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170031,"mean":9.0133083926367,"rank":96802,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":56481,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170031,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":0.94596551724138,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.4375,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/worm_papers\/status\/597040862774693889","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4017547],"posted_on":"2015-05-09T14:10:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Helminth papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/442964093498949632\/nwlIaKzr_normal.jpeg","description":"Automated paper feed twitter bot for academics interested in parasitic worms, gut parasites and anthelminthics","id_on_source":"worm_papers","tweeter_id":"2381877092","geo":{"lt":53.48095,"ln":-2.23743,"country":"GB"},"followers":324},"tweet_id":"597040862774693889"}]}}
