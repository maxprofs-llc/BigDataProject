Ascites were collected before and 5 days after perfusion for assessment of autophagy levels in cancer cells. In addition, 24 tumor-bearing mice were randomly divided into control, DDP, CQ and CQ + DDP groups.\nIn 54.3% (19\/35) of patients the treatment was therapeutically effective (OR), 5 days after peritoneal chemotherapy, 13 patients had the decreased ascites Beclin-1 mRNA levels. In 16 patients who had NR, only 2 cases had decreased Beclin-1 (P=0.001). Compared with the control group, the xenograft growth in nude mice in the DDP group was low, and the inhibition rate was 47.6%. In combination with chloroquine, the inhibition rate increased to 84.7% (P<0.01). The LC3-II\/I ratio, and Beclin1 and MDR1\/P-gp expression were decreased, while caspase 3 protein levels increased (P<0.05).\nAntitumor ability of cisplatin was associated with autophagy activity and chloroquine can enhance chemosensitivity to cisplatin in gastric cancer xenografts nude mice.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006b68","authors":["Zhang, Hui-Qing","Fang, Nian","Liu, Xiao-Mei","Xiong, Shu-Ping","Liao, Yu-Qian","Jin, Wen-Jian","Song, Rong-Feng","Wan, Yi-Ye"],"first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T13:50:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1513-7368"],"issue":"9","journal":"Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention","last_mentioned_on":1440289796,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25987058?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25987058","pubdate":"2015-05-20T22:03:27+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Antitumor activity of chloroquine in combination with Cisplatin in human gastric cancer xenografts.","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antitumor-activity-chloroquine-combination-cisplatin-human-gastric-cancer-xenografts"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5570812,"mean":6.3320570527354,"rank":3707730,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1632967,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5570812,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179373,"mean":9.0325131012645,"rank":119554,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":51283,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179373,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1264,"mean":1.9177814726841,"rank":481,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":755,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1264,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":0.64285714285714,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
