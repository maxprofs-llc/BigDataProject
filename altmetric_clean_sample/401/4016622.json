We evaluated effect of infusion of fat or placebo in duodenum randomly in patients with TS and healthy controls on antroduodenal manometry (ADM) and mediators of ileal brake, and duodenocaecal transit time (DCTT).\nADM and DCTT (lactulose hydrogen breath test, HBT) were evaluated with placebo and fat in eight controls and 13 patients with TS (diagnostic criteria: tests showing malabsorption of two unrelated substances, abnormal duodenal histology, absence of other causes, response to antibiotics and folate).\nPatients with TS (6 had SIBO by glucose HBT) were similar in age and gender with controls. After fat infusion, proximal gut motility index (MI) was reduced compared to fasting state in TS, and DCTT was longer in TS than controls (200 min, 120-380 vs. 130, 70-160, P=0.001), though comparable after placebo (70 min, 30-140 vs. 60, 40-90). TS patients had higher PYY and neurotensin than controls after fat infusion. DCTT after fat infusion correlated with plasma level of PYY in TS but not in controls. Post-fat PYY and neurotensin levels were higher in TS with lower BMI (<16 kg\/m [2] ) than those with higher BMI. Parameters of ileal brake (post-fat DCTT, PYY and neurotensin) were higher in patients with than without SIBO.\nFat infusion reduced proximal gut MI, increased DCTT, PYY, and neurotensin among patients with TS. Malabsorbed fat might cause exaggerated ileal brake reducing gut motility, promoting SIBO and bacterial colonization and malabsorption in TS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002aad","authors":["Ghoshal, Uday C","Kumar, Sunil","Misra, Asha","Choudhuri, Gourdas"],"first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T12:36:53+00:00","issns":["0971-5916"],"issue":"1","journal":"Indian Journal of Medical Research","last_mentioned_on":1431370573,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23481053"],"pmcid":"PMC3657900","pmid":"23481053","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Pathogenesis of tropical sprue: a pilot study of antroduodenal manometry, duodenocaecal transit time & fat-induced ileal brake.","type":"article","volume":"137","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pathogenesis-tropical-sprue-pilot-study-antroduodenal-manometry-duodenocaecal-transit-time-fatinduce"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5085280,"mean":6.0241177972752,"rank":1189968,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":3881462,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5085280,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170411,"mean":9.0199580071593,"rank":52741,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":116888,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170411,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":480,"mean":2.4383423799582,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":415,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":480,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.97,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":3},"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/davstojan\/status\/597837622384328704","license":"datasift","rt":["damo1502"],"citation_ids":[4016622],"posted_on":"2015-05-11T18:56:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Davor Stojanov","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/613832062575849473\/8dmVOtXw_normal.jpg","description":"MSc.
