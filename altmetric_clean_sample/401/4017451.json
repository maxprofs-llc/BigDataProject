Since high levels of resistance to Cry proteins involve alterations in Cry-binding midgut receptors, their identification is needed to develop resistance management strategies. Through Illumina sequencing we generated a transcriptome containing 16,161 annotated unigenes for the Oriental leafworm (Spodoptera litura). Transcriptome mining identified 6 contigs with identity to reported lepidopteran Cry toxin receptors. Using PCR we confirmed their expression during the larval stage and compared their quantitative expression in larvae from susceptible and a field-derived Cry1Ca resistant strain of S. litura. Among reduced transcript levels detected for most tested contigs in the Cry1Ca-resistant S. litura larvae, the most dramatic reduction (up to 99%) was detected for alkaline phosphatase contigs. This study significantly expands S. litura transcriptomic resources and provides preliminary identification of putative receptor genes with altered expression in S. litura resistant to Cry1Ca toxin.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e0d","authors":["Gong, Liang","Wang, Huidong","Qi, Jiangwei","Han, Lanzhi","Hu, Meiying","Jurat-Fuentes, Juan Luis"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jip.2015.05.008","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T13:10:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1096-0805"],"journal":"Journal of Invertebrate Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1432123307,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25981133"],"pmid":"25981133","pubdate":"2015-05-20T22:11:30+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Homologs to Cry toxin receptor genes in a de novo transcriptome and their altered expression in resistant Spodoptera litura larvae.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/homologs-cry-toxin-receptor-genes-novo-transcriptome-altered-expression-resistant-spodoptera-litura"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5124740,"mean":6.0645075040905,"rank":2705903,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1749882,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5124740,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171253,"mean":9.0221660710533,"rank":97558,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":56856,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171253,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":362,"mean":2.9896786703601,"rank":205,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":94,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":362,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":5.925,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
