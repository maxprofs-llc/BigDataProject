To this end, PI-PLC\u03b21 was quantified on 70 MDS patients (IPSS risk: 13 Low, 20 Int-1, 31 Int-2, 6 High) at baseline and during the first 3 cycles of azacitidine. Results were then compared with the hematologic response, as assessed after the 6th cycle of azacitidine therapy. Overall, 60 patients completed 6 cycles of azacitidine, and for them, a clinical and molecular evaluation was possible: 37 of these patients (62%) showed a specific increase of PI-PLC\u03b21 mRNA within the first 3 cycles, which was associated with a longer duration of response and with an increased myeloid differentiation, as evidenced by PI-PLC\u03b32 induction and the recruitment of specific myeloid-associated transcription factors to the PI-PLC\u03b21 promoter during azacitidine response. Moreover, the increase of cyclin D3 gene expression throughout all of the therapy showed that PI-PLC\u03b21-dependent signaling is indeed activated in azacitidine responder patients. Taken together, our results show that PI-PLC\u03b21 quantification in MDS predicts the response to azacitidine and is associated with an increased myeloid differentiation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007d16","authors":["Cocco, Lucio","Finelli, Carlo","Mongiorgi, Sara","Clissa, Cristina","Russo, Domenico","Bosi, Costanza","Quaranta, Marilisa","Malagola, Michele","Parisi, Sarah","Stanzani, Marta","Ramazzotti, Giulia","Mariani, Giulia A","Billi, Anna Maria","Manzoli, Lucia","Follo, Matilde Y"],"doi":"10.1189\/jlb.2ma1114-541r","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T11:19:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1938-3673"],"journal":"Journal of Leukocyte Biology","last_mentioned_on":1431777034,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25977289?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25977289","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"An increased expression of PI-PLC\u03b21 is associated with myeloid differentiation and a longer response to azacitidine in myelodysplastic syndromes.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increased-expression-piplc1-associated-myeloid-differentiation-longer-response-azacitidine-myelodysp"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5103864,"mean":6.0451169610166,"rank":4244809,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5103864,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170782,"mean":9.0209331951448,"rank":140955,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170782,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":889,"mean":4.0860405405405,"rank":720,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":889,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":6.8202051282051,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/epigen_papers\/status\/599542453297815553","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4014400],"posted_on":"2015-05-16T11:50:34+00:00","author":{"name":"epigenetics_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Epigenetics","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/471205704921931776\/wSQqKYz8_normal.jpeg","description":"Chromatin & epigenetics paper feed from #Pubmed and #Arxiv - hear it here first!
