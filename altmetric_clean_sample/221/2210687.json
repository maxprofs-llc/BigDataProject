There remains significant controversy about appropriate sex assignment in this group. We aimed, therefore, to assess gender identity (GI) in 50 consecutive patients with DSD presenting to a referral centre in Chittagong, Bangladesh, and correlate it with Prader score, to see if the latter could be used to predict GI.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032b5","authors":["Tanvir K.
