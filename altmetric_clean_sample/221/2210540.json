Required management may include control of another species, habitat maintenance, or artificial recruitment. Sometimes, it can be difficult to determine whether sustained management is required. We used nonspatial stochastic population projection matrix simulation and a spatially explicit population model to estimate the effects of parasitism by a brood parasite, the Brown-headed Cowbird (Moluthrus ater), on a population of endangered Black-capped Vireos (Vireo atricapilla). We simulated parasitism as a percentage of breeding vireo pairs experiencing decreased fecundity due to cowbirds. We estimated maximum sustainable parasitism (i.e., highest percentage of parasitized vireo breeding pairs for which population growth is \u22651) with the nonspatial model under multiple scenarios designed to assess sensitivity to assumptions about population growth rate, demographic effects of parasitism, and spatial distribution of parasitism. We then used the spatially explicit model to estimate cumulative probabilities of the population falling below the population recovery target of 1000 breeding pairs for a range of parasitism rates under multiple scenarios. We constructed our models from data on vireos collected on the Fort Hood Military Reservation, Texas (U.S.A.). Estimates of maximum sustainable parasitism rates ranged from 9-12% in scenarios with a low (6%) vireo population growth rate to 49-60% in scenarios with a high (24%) growth rate. Sustained parasitism above 45-85%, depending on the scenario, would likely result in the Fort Hood Vireo population dropping below its recovery goal within the next 25 years. These estimates suggest that vireos, although tolerant of low parasitism rates, are a conservation-reliant species dependent on cowbird management.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002607","authors":["WILSEY, CHAD B.","LAWLER, JOSHUA J.","CIMPRICH, DAVID","SCHUMAKER, NATHAN H."],"doi":"10.1111\/cobi.12176","endpage":"571","first_seen_on":"2014-03-25T08:20:36+00:00","issns":["1523-1739","0888-8892"],"issue":"2","journal":"Conservation Biology","last_mentioned_on":1395735630,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cobi.12176\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cobi.12176\/pdf","pmid":"24299126","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"561","subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Dependence of the Endangered Black\u2010Capped Vireo on Sustained Cowbird Management","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dependence-endangered-blackcapped-vireo-sustained-cowbird-management"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6249368,"mean":5.9909691960817,"rank":5312472,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6249368,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":135096,"mean":8.2072940967469,"rank":110236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":135096,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1244,"mean":9.5205293644409,"rank":1132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1244,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":12.8826875,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
