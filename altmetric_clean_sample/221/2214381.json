In addition to N3-carbamoyl-7-aryl-octahydroazonino[5,4-b]indoles prepared in one step, a wide range of N3-substituted substrates were synthesized in one pot via the derivatization of a versatile N3-H-azonino[5,4-b]indole intermediate generated in situ by application of the same strategy. A subset of 308 compounds out of a virtual library of 3216, representing 13 different chemotypes, was prepared by high throughput solution-phase synthesis and subsequently purified by mass-triggered high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A total of 188 compounds with a minimum purity of 80% by UV214\u00a0nm and 85% by evaporative light scattering detection (ELSD) was isolated for primary screening.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006813","authors":["Demosthenes Fokas"],"doi":"10.1021\/co300122n","first_seen_on":"2014-03-26T14:16:45+00:00","issns":["2156-8952"],"journal":"ACS Combinatorial Science","last_mentioned_on":1395843363,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/pdf\/10.1021\/co300122n"],"pmid":"23237513","pubdate":"2012-12-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Diversity Oriented Synthesis of a Vinblastine-Templated Library of 7-Aryl-Octahydroazonino[5,4-b]indoles via a Three-Component Reaction.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diversity-oriented-synthesis-vinblastinetemplated-library-7aryloctahydroazonino54bindoles-via-threec"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2300101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1608410,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107071,"mean":8.0086830111145,"rank":53081,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":37782,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107071,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":2.2755409836066,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.66666666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
