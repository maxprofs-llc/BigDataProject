This study determined whether the introduction and use of second-generation inhaled glucocorticoids (GCs), long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs), and combination inhaled GC\/LABA (iGC\/LABA) products and leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) have impacted children with severe asthma. A retrospective review of children (aged 6-18 years) referred to National Jewish Health for severe asthma between 2003 and 2007 (current cohort) was performed (n = 65); the results were compared with a published cohort from 1993 to 1997 (historic cohort; n = 164). When comparing the current cohort to the historic cohort, the percentage requiring chronic oral GC therapy (28% versus 51%; p = 0.001), average dose (3.7 \u00b1 2.4 mg\/dose versus 16.7 \u00b1 1.4 mg\/dose; p < 0.0001), and duration of oral GC use (17.8 \u00b1 8.6 months versus 33.7 \u00b1 3.5 months; p = 0.09) were less. Ninety-seven percent of the current cohort was on a second-generation iGC either alone or in combination with an LABA, 76% were on an LTRA, and 66% were on combination iGC\/LABA product, while none of the historic cohort received these medications. In addition, the current cohort had a higher forced expiratory volume in 1 second (84 \u00b1 2.5% versus 76 \u00b1 2% of predicted; p = 0.008), required less albuterol (33 \u00b1 9 inhalations\/week versus 71 \u00b1 7 inhalations\/week; p = 0.0007), had fewer intubations in the past (13% versus 21%; p = 0.13) and had fewer GC-induced adverse effects compared with the historic cohort. The current cohort required less chronic oral GCs, had better asthma control, and had fewer GC-induced adverse effects compared with the historic cohort studied 10 years ago. This is most likely because of the use of more effective medications for childhood asthma.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f61000694a","authors":["Monica B.
