Here, we inkjet printed silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on cellulose paper and established a Raman spectroscopic approach to detect the odors of explosive trinitrotoluene (TNT) crystals and residues in the open environment. The layer-by-layer printed AgNP paper was modified with p-aminobenzenethiol (PABT) for efficiently collecting airborne TNT via a charge-transfer reaction and for greatly enhancing the Raman scattering of PABT by multiple spectral resonances. Thus, a Raman switch concept by the Raman readout of PABT for the detection of TNT was proposed. The AgNPs paper at different sites exhibited a highly uniform sensitivity to TNT due to the layer-by-layer printing, and the sensitive limit could reach 1.6 \u00d7 10(-17) g\/cm(2) TNT. Experimentally, upon applying a beam of near-infrared low-energy laser to slightly heat (but not destruct) TNT crystals, the resulting airborne TNT in the open environment was probed at the height of 5 cm, in which the concentration of airborne species was lower than 10 ppt by a theoretical analysis. Similarly, the odors from 1.4 ppm TNT in soil and 7.2, 2.9, and 5.7 ng\/cm(2) TNT on clothing, leather, and envelope, respectively, were also quickly sensed for 2 s without destoying these inspected objects.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224e","authors":["Jianping Wang"],"doi":"10.1021\/ac403409q","first_seen_on":"2014-03-26T20:32:42+00:00","issns":["0003-2700"],"journal":"Analytical Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1395936127,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ac403409q"],"pmid":"24605843","pubdate":"2014-03-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Inkjet-Printed Silver Nanoparticle Paper Detects Airborne Species from Crystalline Explosives and Their Ultratrace Residues in Open Environment.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inkjetprinted-silver-nanoparticle-paper-detects-airborne-species-crystalline-explosives-ultratrace-r"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2125283,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2233654,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107070,"mean":8.0089539455867,"rank":47698,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":54941,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107070,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5069,"mean":2.4024313338595,"rank":1745,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5069,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":354,"mean":1.4748045325779,"rank":101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":237,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":354,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
