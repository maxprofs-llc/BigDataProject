Conventional treatments include total condylectomy or local resection of the lesion and condylar reconstruction. But it cannot effectively ameliorate the facial asymmetry. Thus, this article presents the application of combination surgeries including condylectomy, sliding vertical ramus osteotomy, and mandibular contouring in the treatments of this kind of disease. From 2007 to 2012, 12 patients with osteochondroma of the mandibular condyle were included. All of them accepted condylectomy, sliding vertical ramus osteotomy, and mandibular contouring at 1 stage. Mandibular contouring included mandibular inferior border ostectomy, mandibular outer cortex ostectomy, and horizontal osteotomy genioplasty according to the characters of jaw deformity. In addition, maximal mouth opening, pain in the TMJ, and numbness of the lower lip were recorded preoperatively and postoperatively to evaluate the therapeutic effects. All of patients obtained satisfactory results; TMJ dysfunction, facial asymmetry, and abnormal occlusion were improved greatly. No patients developed recurrence of the tumor during the follow-up period. In conclusion, after condylectomy, sliding vertical ramus osteotomy and mandibular contouring were operated at 1 stage, which effectively ameliorated the condylar osteochondroma patient's facial asymmetry and abnormal occlusion and achieved good therapeutic effects.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007c24","doi":"10.1097\/scs.0000000000000634","first_seen_on":"2014-03-26T15:15:36+00:00","issns":["1049-2275"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Craniofacial Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1395846886,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jcraniofacialsurgery\/Abstract\/2014\/03000\/One_Stage_Treatment_to_Condylar_Osteochondroma.10.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jcraniofacialsurgery\/2014\/03000\/One_Stage_Treatment_to_Condylar_Osteochondroma.10.pdf","pmid":"24531251","pubdate":"2014-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"367","subjects":["dentistry","generalsurgery"],"title":"One-Stage Treatment to Condylar Osteochondroma Combined With Secondary Jaw Bone Deformities by Sliding Vertical Ramus Osteotomy and Mandibular Contouring","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/onestage-treatment-condylar-osteochondroma-combined-secondary-jaw-bone-deformities-sliding-vertical"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3565775,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":137866,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107070,"mean":8.0017294268184,"rank":84180,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":741,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107070,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2563,"mean":0.73940046838408,"rank":935,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2563,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185,"mean":0.65298913043478,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
