Groups of eight rats each received for 7weeks the squid-surimi control (C), glucomannan-enriched squid-surimi (G) and glucomannan-spirulina enriched squid-surimi (GS). Liver weight, cytochrome P450 7A1 expression and cholesterolemia were decreased in G and GS vs. C, improving glutathione red-ox index (p<0.05). G also showed increased glutathione reductase (GR) levels vs. C, but reduced the endothelial (eNOS) and increased the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) levels (p<0.05). The GS diet improved superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and GR activities and eNOS, iNOS and TNF-\u03b1 levels (p<0.05). The glucomannan enriched surimi-diet induced hypocholesterolemic, antioxidant and proinflammatory effects, while the addition of 3g\/kg spirulina kept those hypocholesterolemic and antioxidant effects but reduced the inflammation observed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028f5","doi":"10.1016\/j.foodchem.2014.03.015","first_seen_on":"2014-03-29T15:03:47+00:00","issns":["03088146"],"journal":"Food Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1396105414,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0308814614004002"],"pmid":"24767047","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Liver oxidation and inflammation in Fa\/Fa rats fed glucomannan\/spirulina-surimi","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/liver-oxidation-inflammation-fafa-rats-fed-glucomannanspirulina-surimi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":3039679,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":928664,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107165,"mean":8.0647707252439,"rank":71192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":22107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107165,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2105,"mean":2.7809980988593,"rank":1215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":629,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2105,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":1.5879310344828,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
