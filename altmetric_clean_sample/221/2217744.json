Brenna, Glahn, and Tako studied zinc deficiency in birds in the latest issue of Nutrients"],"citation":{"abstract":"Zinc is a vital micronutrient used for over 300 enzymatic reactions and multiple biochemical and structural processes in the body. To date, sensitive and specific biological markers of zinc status are still needed. The aim of this study was to evaluate Gallus gallus as an in vivo model in the context of assessing the sensitivity of a previously unexplored potential zinc biomarker, the erythrocyte linoleic acid: dihomo-\u03b3-linolenic acid (LA:DGLA) ratio. Diets identical in composition were formulated and two groups of birds (n = 12) were randomly separated upon hatching into two diets, Zn\u207a (zinc adequate control, 42.3 \u03bcg\/g zinc), and Zn\u207b (zinc deficient, 2.5 \u03bcg\/g zinc). Dietary zinc intake, body weight, serum zinc, and the erythrocyte fatty acid profile were measured weekly. At the conclusion of the study, tissues were collected for gene expression analysis. Body weight, feed consumption, zinc intake, and serum zinc were higher in the Zn\u207a control versus Zn\u207b group (p < 0.05). Hepatic TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 gene expression were higher in the Zn\u207a control group (p < 0.05), and hepatic \u0394\u2076 desaturase was significantly higher in the Zn\u207a group (p < 0.001). The LA:DGLA ratio was significantly elevated in the Zn\u207b group compared to the Zn\u207a group (22.6 \u00b1 0.5 and 18.5 \u00b1 0.5, % w\/w, respectively, p < 0.001). This study suggests erythrocyte LA:DGLA is able to differentiate zinc status between zinc adequate and zinc deficient birds, and may be a sensitive biomarker to assess dietary zinc manipulation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6573cf058f610009228","authors":["Spenser Reed","Xia Qin","Rinat Ran-Ressler","James Thomas Brenna","Raymond P.
