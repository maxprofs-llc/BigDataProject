In humans, mood disorders are often accompanied by abnormalities in the organization of the circadian system, which normally synchronizes activities and functions of cells and tissues. Studies on animal models suggest that the basic circadian clock mechanism, which runs in essentially all cells, is implicated in the modulation of biological phenomena regulating affective behaviors. In particular, recent findings highlight the importance of the circadian clock mechanisms in neurological pathways involved in mood, such as monoaminergic neurotransmission, hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis regulation, suprachiasmatic nucleus and olfactory bulb activities, and neurogenesis. Defects at the level of both, the circadian clock mechanism and system, may contribute to the etiology of mood disorders. Modification of the circadian system using chronotherapy appears to be an effective treatment for mood disorders. Additionally, understanding the role of circadian clock mechanisms, which affect the regulation of different mood pathways, will open up the possibility for targeted pharmacological treatments.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023a7","authors":["Schnell A","Albrecht U","Sandrelli F"],"doi":"10.1037\/a0035883","first_seen_on":"2014-03-26T13:58:16+00:00","issns":["0735-7044 (Print)"],"journal":"Behavioral Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1432478997,"links":["http:\/\/psycnet.apa.org\/psycinfo\/2014-10296-001\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24660658","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/24660658\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24660658"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/psycnet.apa.org\/psycarticles\/2014-10296-001.pdf","pmid":"24660658","pubdate":"2014-03-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Psychological Association","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"title":"Rhythm and Mood: Relationships Between the Circadian Clock and Mood-Related Behavior.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rhythm-mood-relationships-between-circadian-clock-moodrelated-behavior"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5137613,"mean":6.0774853371559,"rank":1015176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4116450,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5137613,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125947,"mean":8.2284171152719,"rank":27908,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":97824,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125947,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":463,"mean":3.985025974026,"rank":91,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":371,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":463,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.788,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":8,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
