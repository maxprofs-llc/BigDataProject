Previous studies have shown that activation of glutamate receptors in the spinal dorsal horn is enhanced by impaired glial glutamate transporter functions and proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2). In this study, we for the first time revealed that spinal glial glutamate transporter activities in the neuropathic animals are attenuated by endogenous IL-1\u03b2. Specifically, we demonstrated that nerve injury results in an increased expression of IL-1\u03b2 and activation of PKC in the spinal dorsal horn as well as suppression of glial glutamate uptake activities. We provided evidence that the nerve-injury induced suppression of glial glutamate uptake is at least in part ascribed to endogenous IL-1\u03b2 and activation of PKC in the spinal dorsal horn. IL-1\u03b2 reduces glial glutamate transporter activities through enhancing the endocytosis of both GLT-1 and GLAST glial glutamate transporters. The IL-1\u03b2 induced trafficking of glial glutamate transporters is through the calcium\/PKC signaling pathway, and the dynamin-dependent endocytosis, which is dependent on the integrity of actin filaments. The signaling pathway regulating glial glutamate transporters revealed in this study provides novel targets to attenuate aberrant activation of glutamate receptors in the spinal dorsal horn, which could ultimately help the development of analgesics.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f610007579","authors":["Yan, Xisheng","Yadav, Ruchi","Gao, Mei","Weng, Han\u2010Rong"],"doi":"10.1002\/glia.22665","endpage":"1109","first_seen_on":"2014-03-26T15:13:10+00:00","issns":["1098-1136","0894-1491"],"issue":"7","journal":"Glia","last_mentioned_on":1395932227,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/glia.22665\/abstract;jsessionid=BB622A6815D46D64F9F580B0F7ACB03C.f01t04","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/glia.22665\/abstract;jsessionid=C845C3BBDF219FDE1CD4143B31E1472B.f01t03"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/glia.22665\/pdf","pmid":"24677092","pubdate":"2014-03-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"1093","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Interleukin\u20101 beta enhances endocytosis of glial glutamate transporters in the spinal dorsal horn through activating protein kinase C","type":"article","volume":"62","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interleukin1-beta-enhances-endocytosis-glial-glutamate-transporters-spinal-dorsal-horn-through-activ-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6249368,"mean":5.9909691960817,"rank":2560635,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3552136,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6249368,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":135478,"mean":8.1938729968926,"rank":56237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":75002,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":135478,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":538,"mean":3.2063202979516,"rank":228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":298,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":538,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":5.5957777777778,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
