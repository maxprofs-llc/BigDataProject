To develop successful vaccination programmes, it is important to study and understand the defining characteristics of vaccine sceptics. Research till now mainly focused either on the underlying motives of vaccine refusal, or on socio-demographic differences between vaccine sceptics and non-sceptics. It remained till now unexplored whether both groups differ in terms of basic psychological dispositions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002855","authors":["Jeroen Luyten","Pieter Desmet","Veronica Dorgali","Niel Hens","Philippe Beutels","Luyten J","Desmet P","Dorgali V","Hens N","Beutels P","J.
