The average age was 38.3-year-old. Eight cases presented with distal phalanx fracture and 2 with proximal phalanx fracture. Six cases involved a closed fracture and 4 cases an open fracture. The average LIPUS start time was 3.1 months, and the average treatment period was 5.1 months.\nBone union was obtained in 9 cases (90%). The single case in which bone union was not obtained involved nail deficient severe open fracture. The ratios of joint range of motion on the other side were 50%-100% (average 78.5%). Although a mild skin disorder was seen on the LIPUS treatment site in one case as a complication, it was effectively treated by medication.\nLIPUS demonstrated significant effects in adult phalanx fractures when the maximum gap was small. We saw a bone union 90% of the cases without additional surgery, and confirmed the validity of LIPUS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a82","authors":["Ota, Tsuyoshi"],"doi":"10.1097\/01.bot.0000489979.86963.45","first_seen_on":"2016-08-17T22:15:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1531-2291","0890-5339"],"issue":"8","journal":"Journal of orthopaedic trauma","last_mentioned_on":1471472124,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jorthotrauma\/2016\/08000\/6__Outcome_of_Low_Intensity_Pulsed_Ultrasound.22.pdf?utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jorthotrauma\/2016\/08000\/6__Outcome_of_Low_Intensity_Pulsed_Ultrasound.22.pdf","pmid":"27441767","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"S3","subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"6.
