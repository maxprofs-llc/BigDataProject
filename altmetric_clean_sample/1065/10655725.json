Tumor cells have high glycolytic activity, leading to increased cellular levels of these toxic metabolites. The increased activity of the detoxification system in cancerous cells makes this pathway a viable target for developing novel anticancer agents. In this study, we examined the potential utility of non-glutathione-based inhibitors of the Glo-I enzyme as novel anticancer drugs.\nComputer-aided drug design techniques, such as customized pharmacophoric features, virtual screening, and flexible docking, were used to achieve the project goals. Retrieved hits were extensively filtered and subsequently docked into the active site of the enzyme. The biological activities of retrieved hits were assessed using an in vitro assay against Glo-I.\nSince Glo-I is a zinc metalloenzyme, a customized Zn-binding pharmacophoric feature was used to search for selective inhibitors via virtual screening of a small-molecule database. Seven hits were selected, purchased, and biologically evaluated. Three of the seven hits inhibited Glo-I activity, the most effective of which exerted 76.4% inhibition at a concentration of 25 \u00b5M.\nWe successfully identified a potential Glo-I inhibitor that can serve as a lead compound for further optimization. Moreover, our in silico and experimental results were highly correlated. Hence, the docking protocol adopted in this study may be efficiently employed in future optimization steps.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bbff","authors":["Qosay Al-Balas","Mohammad Hassan","Nizar Alshari","Nizar Mhaidat","Ammar Almaaytah","Fatima Al-Mahasneh","Israa Isawi"],"doi":"10.2147\/dddt.s110997","first_seen_on":"2016-08-18T00:26:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1177-8881"],"journal":"Drug Design, Development and Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1471479640,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/novel-glyoxalase-i-inhibitors-possessing-a-ldquozinc-binding-featurerd-peer-reviewed-article-DDDT"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=31926","pmid":"27574401","pubdate":"2016-08-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Novel glyoxalase-I inhibitors possessing a &ldquo;zinc-binding feature&rdquo; as potential anticancer agents","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-glyoxalaseiinhibitors-possessing-zincbinding-feature-potential-anticancer-agents"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8243836,"mean":6.9683207276644,"rank":7131357,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8243836,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253828,"mean":12.210562650939,"rank":214463,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253828,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1044,"mean":3.7820230105465,"rank":711,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1044,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":10.478676470588,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
