The dependence of the strength of spin correlations on the specific geometry is experimentally studied by measuring the correlations along different lattice tunneling links, where a redistribution of correlations between the different lattice links is observed. By measuring the correlations in a crossover between distinct geometries, we demonstrate an effective reduction of the dimensionality for our atom numbers and temperatures. We also investigate the formation and redistribution time of spin correlations by dynamically changing the lattice geometry and studying the time evolution of the system. Time scales ranging from a sudden quench of the lattice geometry to an adiabatic evolution are probed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008519","authors":["Greif, Daniel","Jotzu, Gregor","Messer, Michael","Desbuquois, R\u00e9mi","Esslinger, Tilman"],"doi":"10.1103\/physrevlett.115.260401","first_seen_on":"2015-12-23T19:58:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1079-7114"],"issue":"26","journal":"Physical Review Letters","last_mentioned_on":1452859392,"links":["http:\/\/journals.aps.org\/prl\/abstract\/10.1103\/PhysRevLett.115.260401?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26764974?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26764974","pubdate":"2016-01-15T12:03:29+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Formation and Dynamics of Antiferromagnetic Correlations in Tunable Optical Lattices.","type":"article","volume":"115","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/formation-dynamics-antiferromagnetic-correlations-tunable-optical-lattices"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6977329,"mean":6.2360291658897,"rank":3237276,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":3556963,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6977329,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":297640,"mean":8.8699921179682,"rank":138514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":146863,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":297640,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14992,"mean":10.264904009072,"rank":9014,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":5581,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14992,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":463,"mean":15.092350649351,"rank":244,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":203,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":463,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
