Ferrocene is chemically robust and readily functionalized which enables its facile incorporation into more complex molecular systems. This coupled with ferrocene's reversible redox properties and ability function as a \"molecular ball bearing\" has led to the use of ferrocene as a component in wide range of interlocked and non-interlocked synthetic molecular machine systems. This review will focus on the exploitation of ferrocene (and related sandwich complexes) for the development of non-interlocked synthetic molecular machines.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024e2","authors":["James D Crowley","Synove O Scottwell","Syn\u00f8ve \u00d8.
