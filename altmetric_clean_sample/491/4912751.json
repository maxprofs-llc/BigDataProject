This requires fetal monitoring and should address the parturient's oxygen saturation, hemoglobin, and cardiac output as it relates to uterine blood flow. Pharmacologic strategies have limited evidence pertaining to hemodynamic stabilization and fetal perfusion. There is some evidence that surgical management of critical mitral stenosis should be percutaneous when possible because cardiac bypass is associated with increased fetal mortality. Fetal monitoring strategies should address central organ perfusion because peripheral scalp pH has not been associated with improved fetal outcomes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005851","authors":["Hu, Huayong","Pasca, Ioana"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ccc.2015.08.004","first_seen_on":"2015-12-22T21:19:32+00:00","issns":["1557-8232","0749-0704"],"issue":"1","journal":"Critical care clinics","last_mentioned_on":1456872437,"links":["http:\/\/www.criticalcare.theclinics.com\/article\/S0749-0704(15)00076-7\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.criticalcare.theclinics.com\/article\/S0749070415000767\/pdf","pmid":"26600447","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["criticalcare"],"title":"Management of Complex Cardiac Issues in the Pregnant Patient","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/management-complex-cardiac-issues-pregnant-patient"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7325869,"mean":6.3768565404091,"rank":3126949,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4115867,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7325869,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":301287,"mean":8.9818593695025,"rank":116388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":180423,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":301287,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208,"mean":3.2172946859903,"rank":126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":77,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":3.7821428571429,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
