The new AL ligament could have a major role in the knee stability.","An In Vitro Robotic Assessment of the Anterolateral Ligament, Part 1 2ry Role of the Anterolateral Ligament in ACL"],"citation":{"abstract":"Recent investigations have described the structural and functional behavior of the anterolateral ligament (ALL) of the knee through pull-apart and isolated sectioning studies. However, the secondary stabilizing role of the ALL in the setting of a complete anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear has not been fully defined for common simulated clinical examinations, such as the pivot-shift, anterior drawer, and internal rotation tests.\nCombined sectioning of the ALL and ACL would lead to increased internal rotation and increased axial plane translation during a pivot-shift test when compared with isolated sectioning of the ACL.\nControlled laboratory study.\nTen fresh-frozen human cadaveric knees were subjected to a simulated pivot-shift test with coupled 10-N\u00b7m valgus and 5-N\u00b7m internal rotation torques from 0\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 of knee flexion and a 5-N\u00b7m internal rotation torque and an 88-N anterior tibial load, both from 0\u00b0 to 120\u00b0 of knee flexion via a 6 degrees of freedom robotic system. Kinematic changes were measured and compared with the intact state for isolated sectioning of the ACL and combined sectioning of the ACL and ALL.\nCombined sectioning of the ACL and ALL resulted in a significant increase in axial plane tibial translation during a simulated pivot shift at 0\u00b0, 15\u00b0, 30\u00b0, and 60\u00b0 of knee flexion and a significant increase in internal rotation at 0\u00b0, 15\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 75\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 105\u00b0, and 120\u00b0 when compared with the intact and ACL-deficient states. Based on the model results, ALL sectioning resulted in an additional 2.1 mm (95% CI, 1.4-2.9 mm; P < .001) of axial plane translation during the pivot shift when compared with ACL-only sectioning, when pooling evidence over all flexion angles. Likewise, when subjected to IR torque, the ACL+ALL-deficient state resulted in an additional 3.2\u00b0 of internal rotation (95% CI, 2.4\u00b0-4.1\u00b0; P < .001) versus the intact state, and the additional sectioning of the ALL increased internal rotation by 2.7\u00b0 (95% CI, 1.8\u00b0-3.6\u00b0; P < .001) versus the ACL-deficient state.\nThe results of this study confirm the ALL as an important lateral knee structure that provides rotatory stability to the knee. Specifically, the ALL was a significant secondary stabilizer throughout flexion during an applied internal rotation torque and simulated pivot-shift test in the context of an ACL-deficient knee.\nResidual internal rotation and a positive pivot shift after ACL reconstruction may be attributed to ALL injury. For these patients, surgical treatment of an ALL tear may be considered.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000221e","authors":["Matthew T. Rasmussen","Marco Nitri","Brady T. Williams","Samuel G.
