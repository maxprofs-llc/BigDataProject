This study aimed to determine whether RAAS plays a part in the fall in blood pressure during drug reactions or not. Twenty patients who experienced hypotension during drug reaction and 15 healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study. None of the patients in the study or control groups were under treatment with any drug that was capable of influencing to RAAS. Serum levels of angiotensin-I (A-I), angiotensin-II (A-II), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and aldosterone were measured in both study and control groups. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the results of the groups. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups with respect to A-I, A-II, ACE and aldosterone levels. It was concluded that a fall in blood pressure during drug reaction must be the result of mast cell mediator effects on the vascular wall rather than RAAS impairment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9113cf058f61000cc84","authors":["Karaayvaz, M","Caliskaner, Z","Baykal, Y","Ozanguc, N"],"first_seen_on":"2015-12-24T00:10:48+00:00","issns":["0125-877X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Asian Pacific journal of allergy and immunology","last_mentioned_on":1450723229,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10928619"],"pmid":"10928619","pubdate":"2000-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Renin angiotensin aldosterone system and drug allergies complicated with hypotension.","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system-drug-allergies-complicated-hypotension"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6803403,"mean":6.1842532809271,"rank":5818823,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6803403,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":295274,"mean":8.8175282331939,"rank":239452,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":295274,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117,"mean":1.5125689655172,"rank":77,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.78571428571429,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Renin angiotensin aldosterone system and drug allergies complicated with hypotension. - PubMed -...","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=672353239572369&id=454071581400537","license":"public","citation_ids":[4918137],"posted_on":"2015-12-21T18:40:29+00:00","summary":"I recently go changed to Aldactone and lasix from HCT and had some incidences of edema and angioedema","author":{"name":"Mast Cell Disorder Support","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/454071581400537","facebook_wall_name":"Mast Cell Disorder Support","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/454071581400537\/picture","id_on_source":"454071581400537"}}]}}
