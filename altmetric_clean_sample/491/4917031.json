On all occasions, the same foods were presented and ingested ad libitum. The Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ) was filled out after the series of 4 meals was completed.\nMeal size was significantly higher in the distraction condition than at baseline (by 301 +\/- 26 kJ; P < 0.001). The difference in energy intake between the baseline and distraction conditions significantly correlated with factor 1 (cognitive restraint) of the TFEQ (r = 0.51, P < 0.01) and with total score (r = 0.32, P < 0.05) but not with disinhibition or hunger. For each additional point on factor 1, meal size increased by 50 kJ under the distraction condition compared with baseline. The group eating condition induced no increase in meal size.\nCognitive restraint exerts a quantifiable limiting effect on intake at meal times and this effect can be offset by cognitive distraction.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005700","authors":["France Bellisle","Anne-Marie Dalix","Bellisle, F","Dalix, A M"],"first_seen_on":"2015-12-23T18:11:04+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["0002-9165","1938-3207"],"issue":"2","journal":"American Journal of Clinical Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1495455540,"links":["http:\/\/ajcn.nutrition.org\/content\/74\/2\/197.full.pdf","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11470720","http:\/\/ajcn.nutrition.org\/content\/74\/2\/197.full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ajcn.nutrition.org\/content\/74\/2\/197.full.pdf","pmid":"11470720","pubdate":"2001-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society for Nutrition","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Cognitive restraint can be offset by distraction, leading to increased meal intake in women","type":"article","volume":"74","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cognitive-restraint-offset-distraction-leading-increased-meal-intake-women"},"altmetric_score":{"score":36,"score_history":{"1y":18,"6m":18,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":36},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8250529,"mean":6.9707556030289,"rank":248908,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":8001105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8250529,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":313099,"mean":9.161694440718,"rank":13973,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":299104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":313099,"percentile":95},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6002,"mean":26.930797867022,"rank":961,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5037,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6002,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119,"mean":56.892576271186,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":90,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
