Soil sensor-controlled irrigation systems are increasingly becoming available. However it is questionable whether irrigation scheduling based on soil measurements in the topsoil could make best use of water for deep-rooted crops. In this study a mechanistic model was employed to investigate water extraction by a deep-rooted cabbage crop from the soil profile throughout crop growth. The model accounts all key processes governing water dynamics in the soil-plant-atmosphere system. Results show that the subsoil provides a significant proportion of the seasonal transpiration, about a third of water transpired over the whole growing season. This suggests that soil water in the entire root zone should be taken into consideration in irrigation scheduling, and for sensor-controlled irrigation systems sensors in the subsoil are essential for detecting soil water status for deep-rooted crops.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6a13cf058f610009a10","authors":["Hu, Zhengfeng","Jin, Huixia","Zhang, Kefeng"],"first_seen_on":"2015-12-23T11:36:22+00:00","issns":["1011-601X"],"issue":"5 Suppl","journal":"Pakistan Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1450870445,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26525032?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26525032","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["chemistry","pharmacology"],"title":"Model development for prediction of soil water dynamics in plant production.","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/model-development-prediction-soil-water-dynamics-plant-production-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6818838,"mean":6.1901666501164,"rank":5832451,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6818838,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":295531,"mean":8.8287438906369,"rank":239693,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":295531,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":296,"mean":1.3973559322034,"rank":163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":296,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":0.51315789473684,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Computer Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RootPapers\/statuses\/679626024561197057","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4915641],"posted_on":"2015-12-23T11:34:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Root Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/447736797422813184\/Q7OqMgVA_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Plant Root papers in #PubMed, #arXiv, #Bioarxiv and #PeerJ Preprints.
