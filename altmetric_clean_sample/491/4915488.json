The role of dysregulated hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor, c-Met, in the development and progression of breast carcinoma is documented. The goal of this work is to explore the chemistry and bioactivity of the secondary metabolites of the endophytic Penicillium chrysogenum cultured from the leaf of the olive tree Olea europea, collected in its natural habitat in Egypt. This fungal extract showed good inhibitory activities against the proliferation and migration of several human breast cancer lines. The CH2Cl2 extract of P. chrysogenum mycelia was subjected to bioguided chromatographic separation to afford three known indole alkaloids; meleagrin (1), roquefortine C (2) and DHTD (3). Meleagrin inhibited the growth of the human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, MDA-468, BT-474, SK BR-3, MCF7 and MCF7-dox, while similar treatment doses were found to have no effect on the growth and viability of the non-tumorigenic human mammary epithelial cells MCF10A. Meleagrin also showed excellent ATP competitive c-Met inhibitory activity in Z-Lyte assay, which was further confirmed via molecular docking studies and Western blot analysis. In addition, meleagrin treatment caused a dose-dependent inhibition of HGF-induced cell migration, and invasion of breast cancer cell lines. Meleagrin treatment potently suppressed the invasive triple negative breast tumor cell growth in an orthotopic athymic nude mice model, promoting this unique natural product from hit to a lead rank. The indole alkaloid meleagrin is a novel lead c-Met inhibitory entity useful for the control of c-Met-dependent metastatic and invasive breast malignancies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f1","authors":["Mady, Mohamed S","Mohyeldin, Mohamed M","Ebrahim, Hassan Y","Elsayed, Heba E","Houssen, Wael E","Haggag, Eman G","Soliman, Randa F","El Sayed, Khalid A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bmc.2015.11.038","endpage":"122","first_seen_on":"2015-12-23T11:23:59+00:00","funders":["nci","niehs"],"issns":["1464-3391","09680896"],"issue":"2","journal":"Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1450870115,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26692349?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4703546","pmid":"26692349","pubdate":"2015-12-23T22:00:31+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"113","subjects":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"title":"The indole alkaloid meleagrin, from the olive tree endophytic fungus Penicillium chrysogenum, as a novel lead for the control of c-Met-dependent breast cancer proliferation, migration and invasion.","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/indole-alkaloid-meleagrin-olive-tree-endophytic-fungus-penicillium-chrysogenum-novel-lead-control-cm"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6818838,"mean":6.1901666501164,"rank":3099760,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":3536585,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6818838,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":295530,"mean":8.8287631061585,"rank":136618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":146504,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":295530,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1160,"mean":2.2739033649698,"rank":464,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":663,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1160,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":4.5242424242424,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
