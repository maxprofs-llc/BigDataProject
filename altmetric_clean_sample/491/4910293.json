Here we report on a patient from a consanguineous family presenting with renal cysts, short stature, distinctive facial features, missing teeth, brachydactyly, narrow chest, and abnormal ribs. His phenotype resembled a skeletal ciliopathy and the initial clinical differential diagnosis included Jeune thoracic dystrophy and cranioectodermal dysplasia. Due to the presence of parental consanguinity, a homozygous recessive mutation was the suspected cause and homozygosity mapping was used to direct candidate gene sequencing. WDR35, an intraflagellar transport protein previously associated with cranioectodermal dysplasia, the more severe short rib polydactyly syndrome type V and recently Ellis van Creveld syndrome, is present within a region of homozygosity and sequencing of all coding exons identified a novel homozygous nonsynonymous variant, p.Trp1153Cys. This variant affects a highly conserved tryptophan residue, is predicted to be deleterious, and is the most distal mutation yet reported in WDR35. This case expands the spectrum of phenotypes caused by WDR35 mutations, which we review herein. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f61000697d","authors":["Smith, Christopher","Lamont, Ryan E.","Wade, Andrew","Bernier, Francois P.","Parboosingh, Jillian S.","Innes, A.
