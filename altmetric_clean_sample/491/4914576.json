We investigated the neural correlates of subliminal and supraliminal processing of fearful faces and individualized trauma-related words in individuals with PTSD (n=26) compared with healthy controls (n=20) using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Increased activity in the right cerebellum and the posterior cingulum was observed in individuals with PTSD during subliminal processing of trauma-related words, whereas increased activity of the basal forebrain was found within the PTSD group when processing supraliminal trauma-related words. Moreover, significant positive correlations were found between re-experiencing symptoms and response within the amygdala, and between hyper-arousal symptoms and response within the periaqueductal gray matter, during subliminal processing of trauma-related words and during supraliminal processing of fearful faces, respectively. These findings further our understanding of rapid threat processing and defensive responses, highlighting the role of the cerebellum and periaqueductal gray matter as part of an 'innate alarm system' in PTSD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033d3","authors":["Rabellino, Daniela","Densmore, Maria","Frewen, Paul A","Th\u00e9berge, Jean","Lanius, Ruth A","Daniela Rabellino","Maria Densmore","Paul A.
