We therefore evaluated the incidence and risk factors for BP drop during IV administration of the drug.\nWe reviewed the medical records of children with hemato-oncologic disease who were treated with IV itraconazole from January 2012 to December 2013. By analyzing systolic BP (SBP) measurements made from 4 hours before through to 4 hours after itraconazole administration, we evaluated the changes in SBP and the risk factors for an SBP drop, especially clinically meaningful (\u226520%) drops.\nItraconazole was administered 2,627 times to 180 patients. The SBP during the 4 hours following itraconazole administration was lower than during the 4 hours before administration (104 [53.0-160.33 mmHg] versus 105 [59.8-148.3 mmHg]; P<0.001). The decrease in SBP was associated with the application of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) (P=0.012) and the use of inotropic (P=0.005) and hypotensive drugs (P=0.021). A clinically meaningful SBP drop was seen in 5.37% (141 out of 2,627) of the administrations, and the use of inotropics (odds ratio [OR] 6.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.22-13.92; P<0.001), reducing the dose of inotropics (OR 8.08; 95% CI 1.39-46.94; P=0.02), CRRT (OR 3.10, 95% CI 1.41-6.81; P=0.005), and bacteremia (OR 2.70, 95% CI 1.32-5.51; P=0.007) were risk factors, while age was a protective factor (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89-0.97; P<0.001).\nA decrease in SBP was associated with IV administration of itraconazole. It was particularly significant in younger patients with bacteremia using inotropic agents and during application of CRRT. Careful attention to hypotension is warranted during IV administration of itraconazole in this group of patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bbff","authors":["June Dong Park","Hyoung Jin Lee","Kyung Duk Park","Hyoung Jin Kang","Hee Young Shin","Hyo Seop Ahn","Bongjin Lee","Hyung Joo Jeong","Yu Hyeon Choi","Hee Young Ju","Che Ry Hong","Ji Won Lee","Hyery Kim","Dong In Suh"],"doi":"10.2147\/dddt.s95218","first_seen_on":"2015-12-22T15:54:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1177-8881"],"journal":"Drug Design, Development and Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1451646638,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/articles.php?article_id=25020","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26719674?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=28416","pmcid":"PMC4687612","pmid":"26719674","pubdate":"2015-12-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Association of systolic blood pressure drop with intravenous administration of itraconazole in children with hemato-oncologic disease.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-systolic-blood-pressure-drop-intravenous-administration-itraconazole-children-hematoonco"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6897266,"mean":6.1917907788066,"rank":5142383,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":987737,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6897266,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":296331,"mean":8.8368579489082,"rank":201691,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":55584,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":296331,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":921,"mean":3.0937782608696,"rank":473,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":311,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":921,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90,"mean":2.9067415730337,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
