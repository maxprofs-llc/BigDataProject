We developed a novel treatment procedure, termed percutaneous intervertebral-vacuum polymethylmethacrylate injection (PIPI).\nWe included patients with de novo DLS aged \u226565 years who had LBP with a visual analogue scale (VAS) score of >50 for \u22656 months with intervertebral vacuum and vertebral bone marrow edema (BME) defined on fat saturated T2-weighted or gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted MRI. The primary outcomes were evaluated using the VAS score and modified Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). As an objective measurement, we scored BME on magnetic resonance imaging.\nBetween August 2004 and July 2011, 109 patients underwent PIPI and 53 received nonoperative treatment. At 1 month, mean improvements in VAS scores were -55.3 (95% CI, -60.5 to -50.1) and -1.9 (CI, -7.7 to 3.8) and mean improvements in ODI were -22.7 (CI, -27.3 to -18.2) and -0.6 (CI, -6.6 to 5.4) for the PIPI and nonoperative groups, respectively. At 2 years, mean improvements in VAS scores were -52.2 (CI, -59.9 to -44.4) and -4.0 (CI, -10.9 to 3.0) and mean improvements in ODI were -20.7 (CI, -27.3 to -14.5) and -1.0 (CI, -7.7 to 5.7) for the PIPI and nonoperative groups, respectively. BME substantially decreased in the PIPI group compared with the nonoperative group (P\u200a<\u200a0.001) and correlated with VAS score and ODI improvements (VAS score: r\u200a=\u200a0.502, P\u200a<\u200a0.001; ODI: r\u200a=\u200a0.372, P\u200a<\u200a0.001).\nPIPI improved treatment for LBP, with a sustained clinical benefit for at least 2 years.\n3.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100035a7","authors":["Yamada, Kiyotaka","Nakamae, Toshio","Shimbo, Takuro","Kanazawa, Toshikatsu","Okuda, Teruaki","Takata, Haruhiko","Hashimoto, Takashi","Hiramatsu, Takeshi","Tanaka, Nobuhiro","Olmarker, Kjell","Fujimoto, Yoshinori"],"doi":"10.1097\/brs.0000000000001524","first_seen_on":"2016-05-20T23:58:01+00:00","issns":["1528-1159","0362-2436"],"issue":"10","journal":"Spine","last_mentioned_on":1464911115,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/spinejournal\/Abstract\/2016\/05150\/Targeted_Therapy_for_Low_Back_Pain_in_Elderly.9.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/spinejournal\/2016\/05150\/Targeted_Therapy_for_Low_Back_Pain_in_Elderly.9.pdf","pmid":"26909842","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"872","subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Targeted Therapy for Low Back Pain in Elderly Degenerative Lumbar Scoliosis","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/spinejournal\/Fulltext\/2016\/05150\/Targeted_Therapy_for_Low_Back_Pain_in_Elderly.9.aspx","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/targeted-therapy-low-back-pain-elderly-degenerative-lumbar-scoliosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7847043,"mean":6.6493042501824,"rank":3536590,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4232688,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7847043,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269224,"mean":11.46655302853,"rank":116281,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":148396,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269224,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4756,"mean":5.7508786540484,"rank":2240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2442,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4756,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155,"mean":8.7415584415584,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":92,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
