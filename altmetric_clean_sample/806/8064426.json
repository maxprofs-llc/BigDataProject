While its pathogenesis is exploring in the continuously. Found in the recent years, Th17 cells are a new subset of T cells and closely related with inflammatory disorders, autoimmune diseases and cancer. Its differentiation, regulation and biological effects are widely noted as a hot area of research. This review explores the discovery of differentiation and regulation of Th17 cells, the relationship between related cytokines and chronic rhinosinusitis, in order to have a beteer knowledge of chronic rhinosinusitis. This review regards Th17 cells as the main clue, nevertheless, lacking consideration of the impacts of other factors on chronic rhinosinusitis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9213cf058f61000d8a4","authors":["Wang, Yang","Tang, Zhenzhen","Yao, Dongfang"],"first_seen_on":"2016-05-21T00:30:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1001-1781"],"issue":"2","journal":"Lin chuang er bi yan hou ke za zhi Journal of clinical otorhinolaryngology","last_mentioned_on":1463790611,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27192921?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27192921","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"[Progress of Th17 cells in chronic rhinosinusitis].","type":"article","volume":"30"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7724913,"mean":6.6254088328702,"rank":6682751,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7724913,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268778,"mean":11.475023755752,"rank":224177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268778,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233,"mean":0.63620689655172,"rank":110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OTO_docs\/statuses\/733817127312887808","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8064426],"posted_on":"2016-05-21T00:30:11+00:00","author":{"name":"OTOdocs","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/451475015045615617\/pvQ7oTD5_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Otolaryngology papers in #PubMed and #arXiv.","id_on_source":"OTO_docs","tweeter_id":"2424371810","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":385},"tweet_id":"733817127312887808"}]}}
