We created and validated a new model that incorporates mutational data to improve the predictive capacity of the IPSS-R in treated MDS patients. Clinical and mutational data from treated MDS patients diagnosed between January 2000 and January 2012 were used to develop the new prognostic system. A total of 508 patients were divided into training (n=333) and validation (n=175) cohorts. Independent significant prognostic factors for survival included age, IPSS-R, EZH2, SF3B1 and TP53. Weighted coefficients for each factor were used to build the new linear predictive model, which produced four prognostic groups: low, intermediate-1, intermediate-2 and high with a median overall survival of 37.4, 23.2, 19.9 and 12.2 months, respectively, P<0.001. Significant improvement in the C-index of the new model (0.73) was observed compared with the IPSS-R (0.69). The new model predicted outcome both in a separate validation cohort and in another cohort of patients with paired samples at different time points during their disease course. The addition of mutational data to the IPSS-R makes it dynamic and enhances its predictive ability in treated MDS patients regardless of their initial or subsequent therapies.Leukemia advance online publication, 17 June 2016; doi:10.1038\/leu.2016.138.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4fa3cf058f610003008","authors":["A Nazha","M Narkhede","T Radivoyevitch","D J Seastone","B Patel","A T Gerds","S Mukherjee","M Kalaycio","A Advani","B Przychodzen","H E Carraway","J P Maciejewski","M A Sekeres","B J Patel","Nazha, A","Narkhede, M","Radivoyevitch, T","Seastone, D J","Patel, B J","Gerds, A T","Mukherjee, S","Kalaycio, M","Advani, A","Przychodzen, B","Carraway, H E","Maciejewski, J P","Sekeres, M A"],"doi":"10.1038\/leu.2016.138","first_seen_on":"2016-05-20T23:33:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0887-6924","1476-5551"],"issue":"11","journal":"Leukemia (08876924)","last_mentioned_on":1467338791,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/leu\/journal\/vaop\/naam\/abs\/leu2016138a.html","http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/leu\/rss\/aop\/~3\/ZHWHBybQEcs\/leu.2016.138","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27311933,.#MDSsm","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27311933","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/leu\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/leu2016138a.html"],"pmid":"27311933","pubdate":"2016-05-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms","hematology"],"title":"Incorporation of molecular data into the revised international prognostic scoring system in treated patients with myelodysplastic syndromes","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/incorporation-molecular-data-revised-international-prognostic-scoring-system-treated-patients-myelod"},"altmetric_score":{"score":14.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":14.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8089367,"mean":6.882781825169,"rank":556893,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7531465,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8089367,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271318,"mean":11.568914553824,"rank":28047,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":243215,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271318,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1811,"mean":5.2885845303867,"rank":97,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":1714,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1811,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104,"mean":9.8159223300971,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":94,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":5,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":5,"Members of the public":6,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
