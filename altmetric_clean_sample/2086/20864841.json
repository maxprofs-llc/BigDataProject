However their associations are rarely reported. Yet, it has been suggested that a pathological process may link the two diseases.\nA 20-year-old female patient was admitted in the internal medicine service of Aristide Le Dantec Hospital for uncomplicated malaria. She was previously treated for autoimmune hemolytic anaemia using prednisone at 5\u00a0mg per day. Clinical examination showed swelling in front of the sternoclavicular joint. She presented with fever and headache. Thick smear from blood revealed trophozoites of P. falciparum at parasite density of 52,300 parasites\/\u03bcl. The Ziehl-Neelsen stained smear showed the presence of acid-fast bacilli from the fluid puncture of the swelling. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was further isolated in culture. The diagnosis of falciparum malaria co-infection with sternoclavicular tuberculosis was posed. The patient was treated successfully using antimalarial drugs subsequently followed by multidrug antitubercular therapy.\nInteractions between malaria and tuberculosis need to be largely and prospectively investigated and appropriate treatment should be undertaken.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000793","authors":["Boundia Djiba","Baidy Sy Kane","Mamadou Alpha Diallo","Khadim Diongue","Ngon\u00e9 Diaba Diack","Hamidou Deme","Mouhamed Dieng","Maimouna Sow","Daouda Ndiaye","Abdoulaye Pouye","Djiba, Boundia","Kane, Baidy Sy","Diallo, Mamadou Alpha","Diongue, Khadim","Diack, Ngon\u00e9 Diaba","Deme, Hamidou","Dieng, Mouhamed","Sow, Maimouna","Ndiaye, Daouda","Pouye, Abdoulaye"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12941-017-0219-8","first_seen_on":"2017-06-07T03:12:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1476-0711"],"issue":"1","journal":"Annals of Clinical Microbiology and Antimicrobials","last_mentioned_on":1497272404,"links":["https:\/\/ann-clinmicrob.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12941-017-0219-8","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28583115?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28583115?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/s12941-017-0219-8"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/ann-clinmicrob.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12941-017-0219-8?site=ann-clinmicrob.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"28583115","pubdate":"2017-06-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Drug Resistance","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Parasitology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"44","subjects":["microbiology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Tuberculosis arthritis of the sternoclavicular joint after uncomplicated falciparum malaria: a case report","type":"article","volume":"16"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8355069,"mean":7.046560105308,"rank":4455370,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2325797,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8355069,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242598,"mean":12.564931363537,"rank":134317,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":85526,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242598,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268,"mean":3.6829662921348,"rank":140,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":96,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.2722222222222,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"VE":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BIOCIENCIA2013\/statuses\/872290155108937728","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20864841],"posted_on":"2017-06-07T03:12:34+00:00","author":{"name":"BIOCIENCIA","url":"http:\/\/musical100fm.com.ve\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000300217090\/9b25d5f581a95fff46afd4d8d0d0aad0_normal.jpeg","description":"Programa radial de enfermedades, avances tecnol\u00f3gicos, eventos cient\u00edficos de inter\u00e9s, noticias, entrevistas","id_on_source":"BIOCIENCIA2013","tweeter_id":"1672141952","geo":{"lt":10.46354,"ln":-64.1775,"country":"VE"},"followers":900},"tweet_id":"872290155108937728"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MycobactPapers\/statuses\/872392775899238401","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20864841],"posted_on":"2017-06-07T10:00:20+00:00","author":{"name":"Mycobacterium Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/719097737984274432\/6xb8SSeZ_normal.jpg","description":"A daily collection of papers relating to Mycobacterium.
