We hypothesized that circulating mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) contributes to inflammation and could be used as biomarkers. We investigated if circulating mtDNA level is associated with inflammatory cytokines and can be used as a biomarker of mood disorders.\nPlasma mtDNA concentration was measured with real-time quantitative PCR targeting two regions of the mtDNA and plasma levels of four cytokines (GM-CSF, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6) were measured with a multiplex immunoassay method in 109 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). The most significantly correlated cytokine was verified with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The data from 28 patients with bipolar disorder (BD), 17 patients with schizophrenia (SZ), and 29 healthy controls were compared.\nMtDNA levels showed a nominal positive correlation with GM-CSF, IL-2 and IL-4 in patients with MDD. The most significant correlation with IL-4 (\u03c1 = 0.38, P < 0.00005) was verified with an ELISA (\u03c1 = 0.19, P = 0.049). Unexpectedly, patients with MDD and BD showed significantly lower plasma mtDNA levels than controls. MtDNA levels were lower in the depressive state than in the euthymic state in patients with MDD. Patients with depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia did not show significantly higher levels of these four cytokines than controls.\nThere is a possibility that the patients in this study are different from previous studies in which increased cytokine levels were reported. MtDNA levels should be measured in patients showing elevated plasma cytokine levels. A larger sample is required to generalize the results.\nThe present findings coincide with our hypothesis that circulating mtDNA contributes to the inflammation in MDD. Further studies are needed to conclude whether plasma mtDNA would be a biomarker of mood disorders.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c6c","authors":["Kageyama, Yuki","Kasahara, Takaoki","Kato,
