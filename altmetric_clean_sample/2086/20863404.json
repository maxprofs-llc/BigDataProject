When faced with this challenge, faculty at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine converted the majority of in-person histology laboratory sessions to self-study modules that utilize multiple audiovisual modalities and a virtual microscope platform. Outcomes related to this shift were investigated through performance on in-house examinations, results of the United States Medical Licensing Examination(\u00ae) (USMLE(\u00ae) ) Step 1 Examination, and student feedback. Medical School College Admissions Test(\u00ae) (MCAT(\u00ae) ) scores were used as a covariate when comparing in-house examinations. Results revealed no significant change in performance on in-house examinations when the content being assessed was controlled (F(2, 506)\u2009=\u20090.676, P\u2009=\u20090.51). A significant improvement in overall practical examination grade averages was associated with the self-study modules (F(6, 1164)\u2009=\u200910.213, P\u2009<\u20090.01), but gradual changes in examination content may explain this finding. The histology and cell biology portion of USMLE Step 1 Examination remained consistent throughout the time period that was investigated. Student feedback regarding the self-study modules was positive and suggested that features such as instructor narrated videos were an important component of the self-study modules because they helped recreate the experience of in-person laboratory sessions. Positive outcomes from the student perspective and no drop in examination performance suggests that utilizing self-study modules for histology laboratory content may be an option for educators faced with the challenge of reducing contact hours without eliminating content.
