We enrolled 19 C9orf72 and 67 disease severity-matched sporadic MND patients, and 22 controls. Sporadic cases were grouped in patients with: no cognitive\/behavioral deficits (sporadic-motor); same patterns of cognitive\/behavioral impairment as C9orf72 cases (sporadic-cognitive); shorter disease duration versus other sporadic groups (sporadic-early). C9orf72 patients showed cerebellar and thalamic atrophy versus all sporadic cases. All MND patients showed motor, frontal, and temporoparietal cortical thinning and motor and extramotor white matter damage versus controls, independent of genotype and presence of cognitive impairment. Compared with sporadic-early, C9orf72 patients revealed an occipital cortical thinning. C9orf72 patients had enhanced visual network functional connectivity versus sporadic-motor and sporadic-early cases. Structural cerebellar and thalamic damage and posterior cortical alterations are the brain magnetic resonance imaging signatures of C9orf72 MND. Frontotemporal cortical and widespread white matter involvement are likely to be an effect of the disease evolution rather than a C9orf72 marker.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f61000318e","authors":["Agosta, Federica","Ferraro, Pilar M.","Riva, Nilo","Spinelli, Edoardo Gioele","Domi, Teuta","Carrera, Paola","Copetti, Massimiliano","Falzone, Yuri","Ferrari, Maurizio","Lunetta, Christian","Comi, Giancarlo","Falini, Andrea","Quattrini, Angelo","Filippi, Massimo","Federica Agosta","Pilar M.
