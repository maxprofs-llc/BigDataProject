A nonradioactive lanthanide-chelate derivatized IL8 ligand was developed to measure the binding activity of the chemokine receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2. Site-specific mutagenesis of the carboxyl-terminal serine of IL8 to cysteine resulted in a mutant IL8 (IL8-S72C) having a single free sulfhydryl. Using an iodoacetamide derivative of the Eu3+-chelate of N-(p-benzoic acid)diethylenetriamine-N,N',N\"-tetraacetic acid (DTTA), incorporation of one Eu3+ per IL8 molecule ([Eu3+]IL8-S72C) was achieved. The dissociation constant for this conjugate was similar to that measured for [125I]IL8 ( approximately 2 nM) when measured by time-resolved fluorometry using CHO cell lines stably expressing CXCR1 or CXCR2 receptors. The sensitivity, stability, and high specific activity of europium-labeled IL8 demonstrate the usefulness of lanthanide-labeled proteins in the measurement of receptor-ligand interactions and may be extended to other peptide ligands.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c7","authors":["James Inglese","Philippe Samama","Sanjay Patel","Jonathan Burbaum","Ilana L.
