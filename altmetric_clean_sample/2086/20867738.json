Loving this piece from the Vicente and Lopez groups"],"citation":{"abstract":"Allylsilanes have long been recognized as valuable building blocks for organic synthesis. In this investigation, we report that zinc-catalyzed reaction of cyclopropenes and hydrosilanes represents a convenient route to these versatile unsaturated organosilanes. In this transformation, ZnBr2 serves as an efficient catalyst, allowing the generation of a zinc vinyl carbenoid intermediate, which would be subsequently involved in a Si-H bond insertion. The process shows a broad scope, including the use of substituted and functionalized cyclopropenes or the functionalization of polysiloxanes. Moreover, the zinc-catalyzed carbene insertion into a Ge-H bond is reported for the first time.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Mata, Sergio","L\u00f3pez, Luis A.","Vicente, Rub\u00e9n"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201703319","first_seen_on":"2017-06-07T07:32:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["14337851","1521-3773"],"journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
