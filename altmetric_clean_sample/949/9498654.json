Artificial aeration is often used in lake management to counteract these problems, but the effects of aeration on nitrogen (N) cycling are not known. We studied the effects of hypolimnetic aeration on N dynamics and temperature in a eutrophic lake by comparing continuous and pulsed aeration with a nonaerated station. Aeration decreased the accumulation of NH-N deep in the lake (20-33 m) by supplying O for nitrification, which in turn provided substrate for denitrification and promoted N removal. Aeration also increased the temperature in the hypolimnion. Denitrification rate was highest in the nonaerated deep areas (average, 7.62 mg N m d) due to very high rates during spring turnover of the water column, demonstrating that natural turnover provides O for nitrification. During stratification, denitrification was highest at the continuously aerated station (4.06 mg N m d) and lowest at the nonaerated station (3.02 mg N m d). At the periodically aerated station, aeration pauses did not restrict the increase in temperature but resulted in accumulation of NH-N and decreased the contribution of denitrification as a nitrate reduction process. Our findings demonstrate that hypolimnetic aeration can substantially affect N cycling in lakes and that the effect depends on the aeration strategy. Because N is one of the main nutrients controlling eutrophication, the effects of aeration methods on N removal should be considered as part of strategies to manage water quality in lakes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5723cf058f610004c90","authors":["Holmroos, Heidi","Horppila, Jukka","Laakso, Sanna","Niemist\u00f6, Juha","Hietanen, Susanna"],"doi":"10.2134\/jeq2015.09.0455","first_seen_on":"2016-07-08T16:01:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0047-2425"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Environmental Quality","last_mentioned_on":1467970446,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27380085"],"pmid":"27380085","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Earth Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1359","subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Aeration-Induced Changes in Temperature and Nitrogen Dynamics in a Dimictic Lake","type":"article","volume":"45","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aerationinduced-changes-temperature-nitrogen-dynamics-dimictic-lake"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8029085,"mean":6.8046097213542,"rank":3726847,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4270373,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8029085,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259565,"mean":11.542595976329,"rank":116825,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":141034,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259565,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1198,"mean":4.4697978279031,"rank":818,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":376,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1198,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":3.3451904761905,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2},"by_discipline":{"Environmental Science":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"BE":1,"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/msmjetten\/statuses\/751330261976113152","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9498654],"posted_on":"2016-07-08T08:21:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Mike Jetten","url":"http:\/\/t.co\/I17LV1qzvz","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/658596202779291648\/lnkNUolm_normal.jpg","description":"Professor in Microbiology at Radboud University NL, anammox, anaerobes metagenomics, research strategy, strategic recruitment, gender equality, SIAM","id_on_source":"msmjetten","tweeter_id":"591202090","followers":1021},"tweet_id":"751330261976113152"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/corobluis\/statuses\/751331833439260672","license":"gnip","rt":["msmjetten"],"citation_ids":[9498654],"posted_on":"2016-07-08T08:27:22+00:00","author":{"name":"Luis Corbala Robles","url":"http:\/\/www.ugent.be\/bw\/biosysteemtechniek\/en\/research\/biosystems-control\/research-corbalarobles.htm","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/842298162178101248\/lJOas1dm_normal.jpg","description":"PhD candidate @UGent -   Reading, music-ing & gaming -  #canIgettapwater https:\/\/goo.gl\/28eac9 - Beer enthusiast of late https:\/\/goo.gl\/uKcxAb","id_on_source":"corobluis","tweeter_id":"3313280667","geo":{"lt":50.83333,"ln":4,"country":"BE"},"followers":191},"tweet_id":"751331833439260672"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/sawi_mpi\/statuses\/751348624160849920","license":"gnip","rt":["msmjetten"],"citation_ids":[9498654],"posted_on":"2016-07-08T09:34:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Swatantar Kumar","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/773983866604453888\/afrA1WCJ_normal.jpg","description":"Researcher keen to study the biogeochemistry associated with tiny yet great microbes!
