An investigation measuring dry bone specimens also showed that the right humerus had greater retroversion than the left. Considering these facts, it was hypothesized that humeral retroversion would differ between right- and left-handed players. This study aimed to compare the bilateral humeral retroversion between right- and left-handed skeletally mature baseball players.\nWe investigated 260 (196 right-handed and 64 left-handed) male baseball players who belonged to a college or amateur team. Bilateral humeral retroversion was assessed using an ultrasound-assisted technique (humeral torsion angle [HTA]) as described by previous studies. Analysis of covariance, adjusted for handedness and baseball position, assessed the effect of throwing arm dominance on HTA.\nIn comparison of the throwing arm, HTA was significantly smaller in left-handed (left humerus) than in right-handed (right humerus) players (77\u00b0 vs. 81\u00b0; P\u2009<\u2009.001). In comparison of the nonthrowing arm, HTA was significantly greater in left-handed (right humerus) than in right-handed (left humerus) players (73\u00b0 vs. 69\u00b0; P\u2009<\u2009.001). The mean side-to-side difference of HTA was significantly smaller in left-handed than in right-handed players (3\u00b0 vs. 12\u00b0; P\u2009<\u2009.001).\nHumeral retroversion of left-handed skeletally mature baseball players was significantly smaller in the throwing arm, greater in the nonthrowing arm, and smaller in side-to-side differences than that of right-handed players. These findings may be key to understanding some of the biomechanical differences between right- and left-handed baseball players.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e4a","authors":["Tetsuya Takenaga","Hideyuki Goto","Katsumasa Sugimoto","Atsushi Tsuchiya","Masaki Fukuyoshi","Hiroki Nakagawa","Masahiro Nozaki","Satoshi Takeuchi","Takanobu Otsuka"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jse.2017.07.014","first_seen_on":"2017-09-27T22:55:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["10582746"],"journal":"Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1506691123,"links":["http:\/\/www.jshoulderelbow.org\/article\/S1058-2746(17)30435-4\/fulltext"],"pmid":"28941973","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics","generalsurgery"],"title":"Left-handed skeletally mature baseball players have smaller humeral retroversion in the throwing arm than right-handed players","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":3,"1m":3,"1w":3,"6d":3,"5d":1,"4d":0.5,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462498,"mean":7.1083922572655,"rank":2177589,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5132009,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462498,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114183,"mean":11.501880331401,"rank":34759,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":78699,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114183,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1309,"mean":4.5310886850153,"rank":427,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":845,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1309,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":2.5166666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":5}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/kcrehabexpert\/statuses\/913175199440343041","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26668898],"posted_on":"2017-09-27T22:55:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Dan Lorenz","url":"http:\/\/www.ssorkc.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/527554458020884480\/uFYOM2v0_normal.jpeg","description":"Fellowship-trained sports PT.
