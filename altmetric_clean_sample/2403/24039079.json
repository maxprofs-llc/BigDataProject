Radioguided parathyroidectomy with technetium-99m (TC-99m) sestamibi has been successfully used in patients with PHPT. This study was designed to evaluate the results of a series of patients with PHPT who underwent minimally invasive radioguided parathyroidectomy (MIRP) using very low dose (1 mCi) of TC-99m sestamibi (MIBI) without application of intraoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) assay or frozen section analysis.\nEighty-seven patients with PHPT were prospectively studied from November 2012 to January 2015. Following neck ultrasound (US) and MIBI scan concordant for single gland disease, patients underwent MIRP using a handheld gamma probe. The technique involved injecting of 1 mCi MIBI in the operative room before the beginning of the intervention. All patients were followed up for a minimum of 6 months postoperatively.\nMIRP was successfully performed in 86 out of 87 patients (98.85%). The Gamma probe was particularly useful in detection of ectopic parathyroid adenomas in upper midiastinum. Mean operative time was 23.95\u00b17.982 minutes and mean hospital stay was 1.44\u00b10.604 days. No major surgical complications were recorded.\nThe MIRP technique using very low dose (1 mCi) of Tc-99m MIBI without intraoperative PTH assay and frozen section analysis resulted in excellent cure rate for PHPT. This technique involves a radiation exposure to patients and surgical staffs 20 times lower than conventional MIRP using 20 mCi Tc-99m MIBI. Besides, patients with PHPT due to ectopic parathyroid adenoma may especially benefit from MIRP.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079f1","authors":["Mostafa Mehrabibahar","Zohreh Mousavi","Ramin Sadeghi","Parvin Layegh","Masoumeh Nouri","Mehdi Asadi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijsu.2017.02.009","first_seen_on":"2017-08-18T17:09:45+00:00","issns":["17439191"],"journal":"International Journal of Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1486758064,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S1743919117301322&_version=1&md5=ade7a39bd3edb0aa49a9a27b9455b75f"],"pmid":"28192245","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Feasibility and safety of minimally invasive radioguided parathyroidectomy using very low intraoperative dose of Tc-99m MIBI","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/feasibility-safety-minimally-invasive-radioguided-parathyroidectomy-using-very-low-intraoperative-do"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8238000,"mean":6.9701818929509,"rank":6253622,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1110909,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8238000,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93675,"mean":11.582684458868,"rank":65851,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":17311,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93675,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1061,"mean":2.1391150943396,"rank":545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":258,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1061,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":1.7648648648649,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Neuroscience":1,"Business, Management and Accounting":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IJSurgery\/statuses\/830149607610945536","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24039079],"posted_on":"2017-02-10T20:21:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Int J of Surgery","url":"http:\/\/www.journal-surgery.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/681553364858060802\/dGBKyXFu_normal.png","description":"An international, pan-specialty, peer-reviewed journal dedicated to the advancement of surgical research, education and clinical practice.
