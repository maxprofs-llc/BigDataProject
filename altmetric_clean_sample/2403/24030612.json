Their inhibition effects on planktonic cells and pre-formed biofilms were evaluated using microbroth dilution and checkerboard titration methods. Nisin\/ p-coumaric acid combination showed synergistic effects against planktonic cells of both the studied bacteria whereas nisin\/ linalool combination showed synergistic activity against B. cereus and additive effect against S. typhimurium. In pre-formed biofilms, nisin by itself failed to show >50% antibiofilm efficacy against both the studied bacteria, but in combination with linalool and p-coumaric acid, it exerted > 50% antibiofilm efficacy. On the basis of FICI values, nisin\/ p-coumaric acid combination exhibited synergistic antibiofilm activity whereas nisin\/linalool combination showed additive effects against pre-formed biofilms of studied bacteria. The results provide evidence that p-coumaric acid due to its synergistic interactions with nisin against planktonic cells and biofilms of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative foodborne bacteria enhanced the antibacterial spectrum of nisin which subsequently may facilitate their use in the food industry.
