A sensor is demonstrated that enables fast screening for aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) as a model analyte using the antibody-GO complex as the recognition element. The visual limit of detection and cut-off value for AFB1 are 0.3 and 1ng\/mL, respectively. It is shown that GO and carboxylated GO are viable black labels for use in lateral flow assays, one typical advantage being the saving cost (compared to the use of colloidal gold). Qualitative results are achieved within 15min, and the analytical results were in good agreement with the reference LC MS\/MS method. The method was successfully applied to the on-site determination of AFB1 in agricultural products. In our perception, it opens new possibilities for the screening of other toxins by lateral flow immunoassays using GO and carboxylated GO as labels.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003609","authors":["Li Yu","Peiwu Li","Xiaoxia Ding","Qi Zhang"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.talanta.2016.12.042","first_seen_on":"2017-08-18T14:04:07+00:00","issns":["00399140"],"journal":"Talanta","last_mentioned_on":1482712419,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0039914016309833&_version=1&md5=47cb55f408e5c49e268ed49172424837"],"pmid":"28153237","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Graphene oxide and carboxylated graphene oxide: Viable two-dimensional nanolabels for lateral flow immunoassays","type":"article","volume":"165","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/graphene-oxide-carboxylated-graphene-oxide-viable-twodimensional-nanolabels-lateral-flow-immunoassay"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":1.35,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8234883,"mean":6.9712042501575,"rank":4077867,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":4094354,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8234883,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93235,"mean":11.573259347448,"rank":44336,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":47923,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93235,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1530,"mean":1.5766710268149,"rank":450,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":1065,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1530,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":1.4557142857143,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
