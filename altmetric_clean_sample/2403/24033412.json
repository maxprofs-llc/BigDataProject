Out of 278 cases included in the study, early pneumothorax occurred in 109 patients. Follow-up CXRs were available in the remaining 169 patients without early pneumothorax and were obtained 3.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9\u00a0h after biopsy. The rate of delayed pneumothorax was 8.6% (24\/278). Clinically significant pneumothorax occurred in 10\/24 (41.7%) patients with delayed pneumothorax, including one case of tension pneumothorax. Patients with delayed pneumothorax (n\u00a0=\u00a024) had smaller lesion long axial diameter (18.58\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.84 vs 25.83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017.69\u00a0mm, p\u00a0=\u00a00.005), longer intrapulmonary needle tract (23.45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.98 vs 14.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.49, p\u00a0=\u00a00.004), and lower FEV1\/FVC ratio (53.30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a022.47 vs 71.15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.77, p\u00a0=\u00a00.015), compared to those without delayed pneumothorax (n\u00a0=\u00a0145). The length of intrapulmonary needle tract was the only independent predictor of delayed pneumothorax (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008) and symptomatic delayed pneumothorax (p\u00a0=\u00a00.019).\nObtaining a routine follow-up CXR in all patients after CT-guided lung biopsy appears warranted, given the high rate of delayed pneumothorax and large percentage of patients who will require a chest tube. The only independent predictor of (symptomatic) delayed pneumothorax was the length of intrapulmonary needle tract.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006de9","authors":["Shayandokht Taleb","Hamed Jalaeian","Nickolas Frank","Jafar Golzarian","Donna D\u2019Souza"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00270-017-1632-2","first_seen_on":"2017-08-18T14:55:23+00:00","issns":["0174-1551","1432-086X"],"journal":"CardioVascular and Interventional Radiology","last_mentioned_on":1503162195,"links":["https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00270-017-1632-2?platform=hootsuite"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00270-017-1632-2.pdf","pmid":"28432386","pubdate":"2017-04-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Imaging \/ Radiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nuclear Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ultrasound","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["radiology","cardiology"],"title":"Is a Routine Chest X-ray Necessary in Every Patient After Percutaneous CT-Guided Lung Biopsy?
