High yield and favorable pore characteristics in terms of surface area and pore volume were reported for KAC as follows: 44%, 852m(2)\/g, and 0.671cm(3)\/g, respectively. The application of KAC as adsorbent for attraction of ciprofloxacin (CIP) and norfloxacin (NOR) was investigated using fixed bed systems. The effect of flow rate (0.5-1.5ml\/min), bed height (15-25cm), and initial drug concentration (75-225mg\/l) on the behavior of breakthrough curves was explained. The fixed bed analysis showed the better correlation of breakthrough data by both Thomas and Yoon-Nelson models. Inlet drug concentration was of greatest effect on breakthrough data compared to other fixed bed variables. Experimental and calculated breakthrough data were obtained for CIP and NOR adsorption on KAC, thus being important for design of fixed bed column.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f6100065db","authors":["Teeba M.
