The degree and distribution of the arterial wall enhancement on Gd-3DBB was assessed. The association of the degree of wall enhancement with brain infarction\/ischemic lesions on FLAIR, luminal changes on 3D-TOF-MRA, and cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) was investigated by univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses.\nStrong enhancement of the arterial walls was observed in 77 vertebral arteries (33.5%), 4 basilar arteries (3.5%), 31 supraclinoid internal carotid arteries (ICAs) (13.5%) and 8 middle cerebral arteries (3.5%). In addition, 221 intrapetrous ICAs (96.1%) showed strong enhancement. After adjusting for confounding factors, multivariate analyses showed that the patient age was independently associated with the strong wall enhancement of the arteries for both the posterior (OR, 1.088; 95% CI, 1.034-1.146) and the anterior circulation (OR, 1.098, 95% CI 1.029-1.172). In addition, the presence of the supratentorial brain infarctions was independently associated with the strong wall enhancement in the anterior circulation excluding the intrapetrous ICAs (OR, 4.097; 95% CI, 1.483-11.319).\nAlthough the arterial wall enhancement on the Gd-3DBB probably reflects normal aging, the enhancement in the anterior circulation might be related to brain infarctions. On the other hand, the intrapetrous ICA enhancement is considered a nonspecific finding and should not be mistaken for arterial pathologies such as atherosclerosis or arteritis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002856","authors":["Koichi Takano","Kosuke Hida","Yasuo Kuwabara","Kengo Yoshimitsu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ejrad.2016.10.032","first_seen_on":"2017-08-18T14:01:31+00:00","issns":["0720048X"],"journal":"European Journal of Radiology","last_mentioned_on":1483516147,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0720048X16303382&_version=1&md5=7beae3afcb468ecf79abe9750d128d17"],"pmid":"28027739","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["radiology"],"title":"Intracranial arterial wall enhancement using gadolinium-enhanced 3D black-blood T1-weighted imaging","type":"article","volume":"86","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intracranial-arterial-wall-enhancement-using-gadoliniumenhanced-3d-blackblood-t1weighted-imaging"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8234883,"mean":6.9712042501575,"rank":7125840,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8234883,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93227,"mean":11.573112457898,"rank":75962,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93227,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":909,"mean":2.683768722467,"rank":606,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":909,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.28,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Ph.
