To identify the mechanism of endosulfan-impaired endothelial cells, we treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with different concentrations of endosulfan, with and without an inhibitor for Notch, N-[N-(3, 5-difluorophenacetyl)-1-alanyl]S-Phenylglycinet-butylester (DAPT, 20\u00a0\u03bcM), or a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, N-Acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC, 3\u00a0mM), for 24\u00a0h. The results showed that endosulfan could inhibit cell viability\/proliferation by increasing the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), arresting the cell cycle in both S and G2\/M phases, and inducing apoptosis in HUVECs. We also found that endosulfan can damage microfilaments, microtubules, and nuclei; arrest mitosis; remarkably increase the expressions of Dll4, Notch1, Cleaved-Notch1, Jagged1, Notch4, Hes1, and p21; and significantly induce ROS and malondialdehyde production in HUVECs. The presence of DAPT antagonized the above changes of cycle arrest, proliferation inhibition, and expressions of Dll4, Notch1, Cleaved-Notch1, Hes1, and p21 caused by endosulfan; however, NAC could attenuate LDH release; ROS and malondialdehyde production; apoptosis; and the expression levels of Dll4, Notch1, Cleaved-Notch1, Notch4, and Hes1 induced by endosulfan. These results demonstrated that endosulfan inhibited proliferation through the Notch signaling pathway as a result of oxidative stress. In addition, endosulfan can damage the cytoskeleton and block mitosis, which may add another layer of toxic effects on endothelial cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f610006534","authors":["Jialiu Wei","Lianshuang Zhang","Lihua Ren","Jin Zhang","Yang Yu","Ji Wang","Junchao Duan","Cheng Peng","Zhiwei Sun","Xianqing Zhou"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.envpol.2016.08.083","first_seen_on":"2017-08-18T14:56:30+00:00","issns":["02697491"],"journal":"Environmental Pollution","last_mentioned_on":1483628479,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0269749116310569&_version=1&md5=eadf969bfa2fdbc3393ee2f4d28fd5c3"],"pmid":"27939630","pubdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Endosulfan inhibits proliferation through the Notch signaling pathway in human umbilical vein endothelial cells","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/endosulfan-inhibits-proliferation-through-notch-signaling-pathway-human-umbilical-vein-endothelial-c-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8236027,"mean":6.9709132137208,"rank":7126344,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8236027,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93339,"mean":11.580460112709,"rank":76067,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93339,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2244,"mean":6.7998573339278,"rank":1805,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2244,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78,"mean":13.14787012987,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ecotoxicology\/statuses\/817023176207122434","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24033476],"posted_on":"2017-01-05T15:01:19+00:00","author":{"name":"ecotoxicology","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/499652563751280642\/9Yw-u5dW_normal.png","description":"Ecotoxicology and Environmental Pollution  Publications Feed.
