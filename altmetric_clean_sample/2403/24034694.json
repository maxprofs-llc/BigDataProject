FT-IR spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), Thermo gravimetric-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) were used to characterize peach kernel shell, Ag NPs, and Ag NPs\/peach kernel shell. The catalytic activity of the Ag NPs\/peach kernel shell was investigated for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), Methyl Orange (MO), and Methylene Blue (MB) at room temperature. Ag NPs\/peach kernel shell was found to be a highly active catalyst. In addition, Ag NPs\/peach kernel shell can be recovered and reused several times with no significant loss of its catalytic activity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d15","authors":["Bahar Khodadadi","Maryam Bordbar","Mahmoud Nasrollahzadeh"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jcis.2017.01.012","first_seen_on":"2017-08-18T15:37:43+00:00","issns":["00219797"],"journal":"Journal of Colloid & Interface Science","last_mentioned_on":1484354018,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0021979717300127&_version=1&md5=83385e8810660c1f8def4a8cfce1d980"],"pmid":"28088570","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Achillea millefolium L. extract mediated green synthesis of waste peach kernel shell supported silver nanoparticles: Application of the nanoparticles for catalytic reduction of a variety of dyes in water","type":"article","volume":"493","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/achillea-millefolium-l-extract-mediated-green-synthesis-waste-peach-kernel-shell-supported-silver-na"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8236937,"mean":6.9707245456257,"rank":6252911,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1110356,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8236937,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93399,"mean":11.581942504122,"rank":65652,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":17277,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93399,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":856,"mean":2.0809473684211,"rank":476,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":215,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":856,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.165,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
