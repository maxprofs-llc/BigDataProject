This review described very well the current understanding of the pathophysiology, cellular localization, and clinical performance of the most important currently proposed biomarkers of AKI, to include insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP2). At the time that this review was accepted, no work had yet clearly identified the cellular localization of IGFBP7 and TIMP2 in the kidney, and that fact was correctly commented on in the review.
