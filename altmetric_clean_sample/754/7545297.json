Maximal left tonsillar descent was 20.9\u00a0mm, and maximal right tonsillar descent was 17.4\u00a0mm. On MRI sagittal imaging, tonsillar descent ranged from 5 to 27.4\u00a0mm. Fifty-eight\u00a0% of patients had syringomyelia. Five patients (10\u00a0%) on coronal MRI were found to have both cerebellar tonsils that were less than 3\u00a0mm below the foramen magnum. However, all of these patients had greater than 3\u00a0mm of tonsillar ectopia on sagittal imaging. Nineteen patients (38\u00a0%) on coronal MRI were found to have one of the cerebellar tonsils that were less than 3\u00a0mm below the foramen magnum. Similarly, each of these had greater than 3\u00a0mm of tonsillar ecotpia as measured on midsagittal MRI. Also, based on these findings, Chiari I malformation is almost always an asymmetrical tonsillar ectopia.\nSagittal MRI overestimates the degree of tonsillar ectopia in patients with Chiari I malformation. Misdiagnosis may occur if sagittal imaging alone is used. The cerebellar tonsils are paramedian structures, and this should be kept in mind when interpreting midline sagittal MRI.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002511","authors":["R.
