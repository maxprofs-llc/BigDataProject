Our aim was to validate a digital FISH capture and imaging system for the detection of MYC 8q24 translocations using LSI-MYC (a break-apart probe) and MYC 8;14 translocation using IGH-MYC (a fusion probe).\nLSI-MYC probe was evaluated using tissue sections from 35 patients. IGH-MYC probe was evaluated using tissue sections from forty patients. Sections were processed for FISH and analyzed using traditional methods. FISH slides were then analyzed using the GenASIs capture and analysis system.\nResults for LSI-MYC had a high degree of correlation between traditional method of FISH analysis and digital FISH analysis. Results for IGH-MYC had a 100% concordance between traditional method of FISH analysis and digital FISH analysis.\nAnnotated whole slide images of H and E and FISH sections can be digitally aligned, so that areas of tumor within a section can be matched and evaluated with a greater degree of accuracy. Images can be archived permanently, providing a means for examining the results retrospectively. Digital FISH imaging of the MYC translocations provides a better diagnostic tool compared to traditional methods for evaluating lymphomas.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f610004095","authors":["Liew","Michael Liew","Leslie Rowe","Parker W Clement","Rodney R Miles","Mohamed E Salama"],"doi":"10.4103\/2153-3539.181764","first_seen_on":"2016-05-17T07:29:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2153-3539","2229-5089"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Pathology Informatics","last_mentioned_on":1462799439,"links":["http:\/\/www.jpathinformatics.org\/article.asp?issn=2153-3539%3Byear=2016%3Bvolume=7%3Bissue=1%3Bspage=20%3Bepage=20%3Baulast=Liew"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jpathinformatics.org\/article.asp?issn=2153-3539;year=2016;volume=7;issue=1;spage=20;epage=20;aulast=Liew;type=2","pmcid":"PMC4872483","pmid":"27217970","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medknow Publications","startpage":"20","title":"Validation of break-apart and fusion MYC probes using a digital fluorescence in situ hybridization capture and imaging system","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/validation-breakapart-fusion-myc-probes-using-digital-fluorescence-situ-hybridization-capture-imagin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7672691,"mean":6.5915218985731,"rank":6639143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7672691,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268805,"mean":11.536508943319,"rank":224369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268805,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":2.5587341772152,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1.6,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
