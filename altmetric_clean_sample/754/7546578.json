At 6 months, 84.2% of patients were assessed by a researcher blinded to the intervention. The primary outcome was a fall in Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire.\nThere was no difference between groups in the primary outcome [odds ratio (OR) 1.02; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.38, 2.75, P =\u00a00.97]. Secondary outcomes including alcohol consumption and readiness to change did not show a significant difference between groups. However, all secondary outcome measures improved, on average, in both arms.\nAlthough EBI can be delivered in an ED or inpatient setting, it was not shown to be an advantage over screening and usual management (which included advice on alternative services), with patients in both groups showing an average improvement.\nISRCTN78062794.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021c6","authors":["Lynn Owens","Ruwanthi Kolamunnage-Dona","Alan Owens","Liz Perkins","Graham Butcher","Ken Wilson","Sophie Beale","James Mahon","Paula Williamson","Ian Gilmore","Munir Pirmohamed","Owens, Lynn","Kolamunnage-Dona, Ruwanthi","Owens, Alan","Perkins, Liz","Butcher, Graham","Wilson, Ken","Beale, Sophie","Mahon, James","Williamson, Paula","Gilmore, Ian","Pirmohamed, Munir"],"doi":"10.1093\/alcalc\/agw023","endpage":"592","first_seen_on":"2016-05-17T09:40:35+00:00","funders":["niehs","dohuk"],"issns":["1464-3502","0735-0414"],"issue":"5","journal":"Alcohol & Alcoholism","last_mentioned_on":1479306707,"links":["http:\/\/alcalc.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/05\/04\/alcalc.agw023.abstract?papetoc","http:\/\/alcalc.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/05\/04\/alcalc.agw023","http:\/\/alcalc.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/51\/5\/584?rss=1","http:\/\/alcalc.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/51\/5\/584.abstract","http:\/\/alcalc.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/05\/04\/alcalc.agw023.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/alcalc.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/alcalc\/early\/2016\/05\/04\/alcalc.agw023.full.pdf","pmid":"27151969","pubdate":"2016-05-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"584","subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"A Randomized Controlled Trial of Extended Brief Intervention for Alcohol-Dependent Patients in an Acute Hospital Setting","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/alcalc\/article-lookup\/doi\/10.1093\/alcalc\/agw023","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/randomized-controlled-trial-extended-brief-intervention-alcoholdependent-patients-acute-hospital-set-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.45,"score_history":{"1y":5.45,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7700472,"mean":6.6097995325169,"rank":1329472,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":6366623,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7700472,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269122,"mean":11.540050668658,"rank":63824,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":205007,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269122,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1016,"mean":6.4898108374384,"rank":228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":786,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1016,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":13.711666666667,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"AU":1,"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MCA_med\/statuses\/732504746884403200","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7546578],"posted_on":"2016-05-17T09:35:15+00:00","author":{"name":"MCA","url":"http:\/\/www.m-c-a.org.uk","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/684686111260708864\/LAxguqXf_normal.jpg","description":"Medical Council on Alcohol (MCA) is an educational charity dedicated to the understanding & management of alcohol-related health harm.
