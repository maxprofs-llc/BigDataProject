Many different intercalator compounds have been studied because of their activity as mutagens or drugs, but little is known regarding their interaction with nucleosomes, the protein-packaged form of DNA in cells. Here, using crystallographic methods and molecular dynamics simulations, we discovered that adducts formed by [(\u03b7(6) -THA)Ru(ethylenediamine)Cl][PF6 ] (THA=5,8,9,10-tetrahydroanthracene; RAED-THA-Cl[PF6 ]) in the nucleosome comprise a novel one-stranded intercalation and DNA distortion mode. Conversely, the THA group in fact remains solvent exposed and does not disrupt base stacking in RAED-THA adducts on B-form DNA. This newly observed DNA binding mode and topology dependence may actually be prevalent and should be considered when studying covalently binding intercalating compounds.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Ma, Zhujun","Palermo, Giulia","Adhireksan, Zenita","Murray, Benjamin S.","von\u2005Erlach, Thibaud","Dyson, Paul J.","Rothlisberger, Ursula","Davey, Curt A.","Murray, Benjamin S","von Erlach, Thibaud","Dyson, Paul J","Davey, Curt A"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201602145","endpage":"7444","first_seen_on":"2016-05-17T07:37:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3773"],"issue":"26","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
