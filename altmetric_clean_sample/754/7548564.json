Remarkably, alternating-current magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed that the Dy8 cluster shows typical SMM behavior inherited from its Dy3 helical precursor. It is one of the rare polynuclear Lnn SMMs (n > 7) under zero dc field.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Li Zhang","Peng Zhang","Lang Zhao","Jianfeng Wu","Mei Guo","Jinkui Tang"],"doi":"10.1039\/c6dt01718e","endpage":"10562","first_seen_on":"2016-05-17T10:46:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1477-9234"],"issue":"26","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1463481998,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2016\/DT\/C6DT01718E?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=inorganicnews"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2016\/dt\/c6dt01718e","pmid":"27231152","pubdate":"2016-05-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"10556","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Single-molecule magnet behavior in octanuclear dysprosium(III) aggregate inherited from helical triangular Dy3 SMM-building blocks","type":"article","volume":"45","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/singlemolecule-magnet-behavior-octanuclear-dysprosium-iii-aggregate-inherited-helical-triangular-dy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7711702,"mean":6.6147835493025,"rank":6670780,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7711702,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269245,"mean":11.542019142487,"rank":224762,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269245,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10868,"mean":0.68114640655195,"rank":3038,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10868,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":482,"mean":0.69844074844075,"rank":142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":482,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/InorganicNews\/statuses\/732522710740295680","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7548564],"posted_on":"2016-05-17T10:46:38+00:00","author":{"name":"Inorganic News","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1636129253\/DSC01061_2_normal.JPG","description":"News, comments and publications about Inorganic Chemistry.","id_on_source":"InorganicNews","tweeter_id":"411132501","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1288},"tweet_id":"732522710740295680"}]}}
