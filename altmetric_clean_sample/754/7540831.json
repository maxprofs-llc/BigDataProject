PFCON-C consists of a polyfluorene backbone to which multiple tertiary amine side-chains are connected via an amide group. The influence of molecular characteristics on electronic performance and morphological properties were tested and compared to the widely used, literature known, amino-functionalized polyfluorene (PFN) and to polyethylenimine (PEI). PFCON-C reduces the turn-on voltage VON of PPV based OLEDs from ~ 5 V to ~ 3 V and increases the maximum power efficiency from < 2 lm W-1 to > 5 lm W-1 compared to PFN. As a result of its semiconducting backbone, PFCON-C is significantly less sensitive to the processing parameters than PEI, and comparable power efficiencies are achieved for devices where thicknesses of PFCON-C are between 15 and 35 nm. AFM measurements indicate that the presence of non-polar side-chains in the EIL material is important for its film forming behavior while Kelvin probe measurements suggest that the amount of amine groups in the side-chains influences the work-function shift induced by the EIL material. These results are used to suggest strategies for the design of polymeric electron injection layers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f61000680f","authors":["Sebastian Stolz"],"doi":"10.1021\/acsami.6b03557","first_seen_on":"2016-05-17T03:28:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1944-8252","1944-8244"],"journal":"ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces","last_mentioned_on":1463455684,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acsami.6b03557"],"pmid":"27160328","pubdate":"2016-05-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Macromolecular And Materials Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
