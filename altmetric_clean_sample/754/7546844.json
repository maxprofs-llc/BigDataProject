In this study, we developed a novel, facile and ultra-sensitive fluorescence assay for the determination of tumor invasive biomarker \u03b2-glucuronidase (GLU) based on the inner-filter effect (IFE). The nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots (N-CQDs) with green photoluminescence were employed as the fluorophore in IFE, and 4-nitrophenyl-\u03b2-D-glucuronide (PNPG) was used to act as GLU substrate, and GLU catalytic product (p-nitrophenol (PNP)) was capable of acting as the robust absorber in IFE to turn off the fluorescence of N-CQDs due to the complementary overlap between the absorption of PNP and the excitation of N-CQDs. Thus, signal of GLU activity could be recorded by the fluorescence intensity of N-CQDs. Unlike other fluorescence sensing mechanism such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) or photoinduced electron transfer (PET), IFE has no requirement for electron or energy transfer process or any chemical modification of fluorophore, which makes our assay more flexible and simple. The proposed method exhibited a good linear relationship from 1UL(-1) to 60UL(-1) (R(2)=0.9967) with a low detection limit of 0.3UL(-1). This method was also successfully applied to the analysis of serum samples and the inhibitor screening from natural product. The developed sensor platform was proven to be reliable, facile, sensitive, and selective, making it promising as a candidate for GLU activity detection in clinic tumor diagnose and anti-tumor drug screening.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f7","authors":["Shuaimin Lu","Guoliang Li","Zhengxian Lv","Nannan Qiu","Weiheng Kong","Peiwei Gong","Guang Chen","Lian Xia","Xiaoxi Guo","Jinmao You","Yongning Wu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bios.2016.05.021","endpage":"362","first_seen_on":"2016-05-17T09:48:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["09565663","1873-4235"],"journal":"Biosensors & Bioelectronics","last_mentioned_on":1463478462,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0956566316304390&_version=1&md5=c937f620ff8bf40b3cc8a2637311baf2"],"pmid":"27196253","pubdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"358","subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Facile and ultrasensitive fluorescence sensor platform for tumor invasive biomaker \u03b2-glucuronidase detection and inhibitor evaluation with carbon quantum dots based on inner-filter effect","type":"article","volume":"85","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/facile-ultrasensitive-fluorescence-sensor-platform-tumor-invasive-biomaker-%CE%B2glucuronidase-detection"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7711702,"mean":6.6147835493025,"rank":5831194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1040878,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7711702,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269246,"mean":11.541993359207,"rank":188386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":44486,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269246,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1933,"mean":2.6788985507246,"rank":1118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":413,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1933,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103,"mean":3.4349803921569,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
