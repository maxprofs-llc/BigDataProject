The unprecedented outcomes demonstrated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors in molecularly defined cohorts of patients has underscored the importance of genetic profiling in this disease. Despite published guidelines on biomarker testing, successful tumor genotyping faces significant hurdles at both academic and community-based practices. Oncologists are now faced with interpreting large-scale genomic data from multiple tumor types, possibly making it difficult to stay current with practice standards in lung cancer. In addition, physicians' lack of time, resources, and face-to-face opportunities can interfere with the multidisciplinary approach that is essential to delivery of care. Finally, several challenges exist in optimizing the amount and quality of tissue for molecular testing. Recognizing the importance of biomarker testing, a series of advisory boards were recently convened to address these hurdles and clarify best practices. We reviewed these challenges and established recommendations to help optimize tissue acquisition, processing, and testing within the framework of a multidisciplinary approach.\nAlthough several professional societies have incorporated biomarker testing recommendations into clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), health care providers still face considerable challenges when establishing and implementing these standards. Developing and instituting protocols to ensure that all appropriate patients are tested for molecular biomarkers requires communication among the various specialists involved in the care of patients with NSCLC. This report provides insights into key challenges and recommendations for molecular testing of patients with metastatic NSCLC, summarized from a multidisciplinary team of experts spanning academic, community, and integrated health systems.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005bda","authors":["Benjamin P.
