Oxygen levels are assessed for traditional circuit designs using sonic metering valves to inject a constant mass flow of fresh makeup as well as two alternative respiration-rate-coupled gas dosage designs using demand injection valves. The impact of variations in diver depth, activity level, gas injection rate, circuit volume, and makeup gas composition on these circuit oxygen levels is demonstrated. Respiration-coupled, demand gas delivery systems are shown to have significantly reduced circuit oxygen variations over a wide range of diver activity levels when compared to constant mass flow injection systems. Additionally, the respiration-coupled designs are shown to have potential reduced gas usage at low diver activity levels, resulting in longer mission duration capability, when compared to constant mass injection systems.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9203cf058f61000d7a6","authors":["Nuckols, M L","Clarke, J R","Marr, W J"],"first_seen_on":"2015-09-01T21:23:22+00:00","issns":["1069-9422"],"issue":"3","journal":"Life support biosphere science international journal of earth space","last_mentioned_on":1438722897,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11542685"],"pmid":"11542685","pubdate":"1999-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["science","biology"],"title":"Assessment of oxygen levels in alternative designs of semiclosed underwater breathing apparatus.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/assessment-oxygen-levels-alternative-designs-semiclosed-underwater-breathing-apparatus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5441762,"mean":6.3365278544923,"rank":1375722,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3444576,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5441762,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190740,"mean":9.5609747141383,"rank":58995,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":129543,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190740,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":4.2794117647059,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"DE":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"John R Clarke","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=674582689#altmetric_citation_054d9070-ae3e-41ec-8b4b-d214dc2aaa92","license":"public","citation_ids":[4461581],"posted_on":"2015-08-04T21:14:57+00:00","summary":"John R Clarke is an American scientist, private pilot and author.
