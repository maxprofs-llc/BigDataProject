The developed protocol utilizes the electrophilic center of DMSO for oxidation, which was unexplored before. Mechanistic investigation has confirmed that the source of oxygen is DMSO.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024e2","authors":["Rajesh Chebolu","Ashish Bahuguna","Reena Sharma","Vivek Kumar Mishra","Ponneri Chandrababu Ravikumar","P.
