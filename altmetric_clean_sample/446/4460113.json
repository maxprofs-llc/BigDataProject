However, it is unclear which cell types are involved in these beneficial effects, because AngII may exert its adverse effects by modulating multiple reno-vascular and cardiac functions via AngII type 1 receptors (AT1R). To test the hypothesis that SIL\/cGMP oppose cardiac stress provoked by amplified AngII\/AT1R directly in cardiomyocytes (CMs), we studied transgenic mice with CM-specific overexpression of the AT1R under the control of the \u03b1-myosin-heavy chain promoter (\u03b1MHC-AT1Rtg\/+). The extent of cardiac growth was assessed in absence or presence of SIL and defined by referring changes in heart-weight to body-weight or tibia length. Hypertrophic marker genes, extracellular matrix-regulating factors and expression patterns of fibrosis markers were examined in \u03b1MHC-AT1Rtg\/+ ventricles (\u00b1SIL) and corroborated by investigating different components of the natriuretic peptide (NP)\/PDE5\/cGMP pathway as well as cardiac functions. cGMP levels in heart lysates and intact CMs were measured by competitive immunoassays and FRET. We find higher cardiac and CM cGMP levels and up-regulation of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase I (cGKI) with AT1R over-expression. However, even a prolonged SIL treatment regimen did not limit the progressive CM growth, fibrosis or decline in cardiac functions in the \u03b1MHC-AT1Rtg\/+ model suggesting that SIL does not interfere with the pathogenic actions of amplified AT1R signaling in CMs. Hence, the cardiac\/non-cardiac cells involved in the cross-talk between SIL-sensitive PDE activity and AngII\/AT1R need to be identified.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007de2","authors":["Julia Straubinger","Verena Sch\u00f6ttle","Nadja Bork","Hariharan Subramanian","Sarah D\u00fcnnes","Michael Russwurm","Meinrad Gawaz","Andreas Friebe","Mona Nemer","Viacheslav O.
