In the prospective and multicenter DIAST-CHF (Diagnostic Trial on Prevalence and Clinical Course of Diastolic Dysfunction and Heart Failure) study, we therefore, tested the hypothesis that adrenomedullin (ADM), a well-established predictor for cardiovascular outcome, is associated with self-rated anxiety symptoms in patients at risk of suffering from or actually with overt heart failure.\nStudy participants with risk factors for diastolic dysfunction were requested to complete the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and plasma mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM) concentrations were measured.\nIn bivariate analysis, we found significantly lower plasma MR-proADM levels in patients with elevated HADS-anxiety scores above the clinically relevant cut-off level of \u226511 (n=118, 536pmol\/l, interquartile range [IQR] 449-626) as compared to non-anxious study participants (n=1,292, 573pmol\/l, IQR 486-702, p=0.001). A set of multivariate models adjusted for potential confounders confirmed the negative association between self-rated anxiety symptoms and plasma MR-proADM. In similar models, no significant association was detected between HADS-depression scores and MR-proADM.\nThe inverse relationship between plasma MR-proADM and anxiety observed in patients with cardiovascular risk factors supports a previous experimental study using a mutant mouse line with a brain-specific loss of ADM expression which displayed hyperactive and over-anxious behavior. Further experimental and clinical studies are warranted to test the hypothesis that also in humans ADM acts as a neuromodulator with anxiolytic properties.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033e6","authors":["Thomas Meyer","Christoph Herrmann-Lingen","Mira-Lynn Chavanon","Burkert Pieske","Rolf Wachter","Frank Edelmann"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.psyneuen.2015.08.007","endpage":"232","first_seen_on":"2015-09-03T19:23:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["03064530","1873-3360"],"journal":"Psychoneuroendocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1441308213,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S030645301500880X&_version=1&md5=9b21aa4652b75fbae664a42642f2cfc0"],"pmid":"26342564","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"227","subjects":["endocrinology","psychiatry","neurology"],"title":"Plasma mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin levels are inversely associated with anxiety but unrelated to depression: Results from the observational DIAST-CHF study in patients with cardiovascular risk factors","type":"article","volume":"62","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/plasma-midregional-proadrenomedullin-levels-inversely-associated-anxiety-unrelated-depression-result"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5974186,"mean":6.0510067910469,"rank":5044654,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5974186,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193842,"mean":9.5365172589905,"rank":155312,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193842,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1534,"mean":7.0869197651663,"rank":1254,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1534,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":5.4548219178082,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
