Current options for such patients include using a lower but tolerated dose of a statin and adding or switching to ezetimibe or other non-statin therapies.\nODYSSEY ALTERNATIVE (NCT01709513) compared alirocumab with ezetimibe in patients at moderate to high cardiovascular risk with statin intolerance (unable to tolerate \u22652 statins, including one at the lowest approved starting dose) due to muscle symptoms. A placebo run-in and statin rechallenge arm were included in an attempt to confirm intolerance. Patients (n\u00a0=\u00a0361) received single-blind subcutaneous (SC) and oral placebo for 4\u00a0weeks during placebo run-in. Patients reporting muscle-related symptoms during the run-in were to be withdrawn. Continuing patients were randomized (2:2:1) to double-blind alirocumab 75\u00a0mg SC every 2\u00a0weeks (Q2W; plus oral placebo), ezetimibe 10\u00a0mg\/d (plus SC placebo Q2W), or atorvastatin 20\u00a0mg\/d (rechallenge; plus SC placebo Q2W) for 24\u00a0weeks. Alirocumab dose was increased to 150\u00a0mg Q2W at week 12 depending on week 8 LDL-C values. Primary end point was percent change in LDL-C from baseline to week 24 (intent-to-treat) for alirocumab vs ezetimibe.\nBaseline mean (standard deviation) LDL-C was 191.3 (69.3) mg\/dL (5.0 [1.8] mmol\/L). Alirocumab reduced mean (standard error) LDL-C by 45.0% (2.2%) vs 14.6% (2.2%) with ezetimibe (mean difference 30.4% [3.1%], P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). Skeletal muscle-related events were less frequent with alirocumab vs atorvastatin (hazard ratio 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.38-0.99, P\u00a0=\u00a0.042).\nAlirocumab produced greater LDL-C reductions than ezetimibe in statin-intolerant patients, with fewer skeletal-muscle adverse events vs atorvastatin.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be8","authors":["Moriarty, Patrick M","Thompson, Paul D","Cannon, Christopher P","Guyton, John R","Bergeron, Jean","Zieve, Franklin J","Bruckert, Eric","Jacobson, Terry A","Kopecky, Stephen L","Baccara-Dinet, Marie T","Du, Yunling","Pordy, Robert","Gipe, Daniel A",", ","Patrick M.
