We designed this work to address this issue.\nTreatment-na\u00efve patients with SSc-PAH were prospectively included from two sources: the French PAH Network (a prospective epidemiological cohort) (n=83) and randomised clinical trials submitted for drug approval (Food and Drug Administration) (n=332). Correlations between absolute values of the 6MWD and haemodynamics at baseline, as well as between variations of 6MWD and haemodynamics during follow-up, were studied in both populations.\nIn the French cohort, baseline cardiac output (CO) (R(2)=0.19, p=0.001) and New York Heart Association class (R(2)=0.10, p<0.001) were significantly and independently correlated with baseline 6MWD in multivariate analysis. A significant, independent, but weaker, correlation with CO was also found in the Food and Drug Administration sample (R(2)=0.04, p<0.001). During follow-up, there was no association between the changes in 6MWD and haemodynamic parameters in patients under PAH-specific treatments.\nIn SSc-PAH, CO independently correlates with 6MWD at baseline, but accounts for a small amount of the variance of 6MWD in both study samples. This suggests that other non-haemodynamic factors could have an impact on the walk distance. Moreover, variations of 6MWD do not reflect changes in haemodynamics among treated patients. Our results suggest that 6MWD is not an accurate surrogate marker for haemodynamic severity, nor an appropriate outcome measure to assess changes in haemodynamics during follow-up in treated SSc-PAH.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a32","authors":["S\u00e9bastien Sanges","David Launay","Rennie L Rhee","Olivier Sitbon","\u00c9ric Hachulla","Luc Mouthon","Lo\u00efc Guillevin","Laurence Rottat","David Montani","Pascal De Groote","Vincent Cottin","Pascal Magro","Gr\u00e9goire Pr\u00e9vot","Fabrice Bauer","Emmanuel Bergot","C\u00e9line Chabanne","Martine Reynaud-Gaubert","Sylvie Leroy","Matthieu Canuet","Olivier Sanchez","Christophe Gut-Gobert","Claire Dauphin","Christophe Pison","Cl\u00e9ment Boissin","Gilbert Habib","Pierre Clerson","Fran\u00e7ois Conesa","Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cordier","Steven M Kawut","Gerald Simonneau","Marc Humbert"],"doi":"10.1136\/annrheumdis-2015-207336","first_seen_on":"2015-09-02T12:27:13+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["1468-2060","0003-4967"],"journal":"Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1496861408,"links":["http:\/\/ard.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/08\/30\/annrheumdis-2015-207336.long","http:\/\/ard.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/08\/30\/annrheumdis-2015-207336.abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26324844?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ard.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/08\/30\/annrheumdis-2015-207336.full.pdf","pmid":"26324844","pubdate":"2015-08-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd and European League Against Rheumatism","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"annrheumdis-2015-207336","subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"A prospective study of the 6\u2005min walk test as a surrogate marker for haemodynamics in two independent cohorts of treatment-na\u00efve systemic sclerosis-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prospective-study-6min-walk-test-surrogate-marker-haemodynamics-two-independent-cohorts-treatmentna%C3%AF"},"altmetric_score":{"score":17.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":17.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8331095,"mean":7.02255168024,"rank":502094,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7827523,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8331095,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232139,"mean":9.1477911673229,"rank":20140,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":211928,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232139,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3206,"mean":8.2311762870515,"rank":314,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":2892,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3206,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90,"mean":13.30995505618,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":74,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
