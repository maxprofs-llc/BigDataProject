Through the in situ templating method, polydopamine could be directly coated onto the magnetic silver nanowires to form Ag NW\/Fe3O4@PDA nanocables. Then, Au(Ag)\/AgCl\/Fe3O4@PDA@Au was elaborately fabricated by utilizing Ag NWs\/Fe3O4@PDA as a template by means of spatially confined galvanic replacement and reduction among Ag NWs, PDA and HAuCl4. These multifunctional nanotubes exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity in the presence of visible light.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["baoyu wang","Min Zhang","weizhen li","Linlin Wang","Jing Zheng","Wenjun Gan","Jingli Xu","Baoyu Wang","Weizhen Li"],"doi":"10.1039\/c5dt02599k","endpage":"17025","first_seen_on":"2015-09-02T15:57:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1477-9234"],"issue":"39","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1441209428,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2015\/DT\/C5DT02599K?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=inorganicnews"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2015\/dt\/c5dt02599k","pmid":"26383705","pubdate":"2015-09-19T22:00:19+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"17020","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Fabrication of Au(Ag)\/AgCl \/Fe3O4@PDA@Au nanocomposites with enhanced visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fabrication-auagagclfe3o4pdaau-nanocomposites-enhanced-visiblelight-driven-photocatalytic-activity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5581375,"mean":6.3956278884028,"rank":4649457,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5581375,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193601,"mean":9.5335378822315,"rank":155174,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193601,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9603,"mean":0.63853988752343,"rank":2645,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9603,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":551,"mean":0.588,"rank":163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":551,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
