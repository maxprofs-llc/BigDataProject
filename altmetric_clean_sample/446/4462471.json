The mean size was 2.98 \u00b1 1.28 cm, and the mean number of sessions was 2.1 per patient. Most patients presented with hemorrhage (82%, n = 18), and 3 (14%) patients were in a deteriorated neurological status (modified Rankin Scale >2) at presentation. Sixty-eight percent of ruptured AVMs had size \u22643 cm. A single transarterial approach was performed in 9 (41%) cases, double catheterization was used in 4 (18%), and the transvenous approach was required in 8 (36%) cases. Procedure-related complications were registered in 3 (14%) cases. One death was associated with treatment, and complementary radiosurgery was required in 2 (9%) patients.\nEmbolization therapy appears to be safe and potentially curative for certain deep AVMs. Our results demonstrate a high percentage of anatomic obliteration with rates of complications that may approach radiosurgery profile. In particular, embolization as stand-alone therapy is most suitable to deep AVMs with small nidus size (\u22643 cm) and\/or associated with single venous drainage in which microsurgery might not be indicated.\nAVM, arteriovenous malformationsDAC, double arterial approachDSA, digital subtraction angiogramEVOH\/DMSO, ethylene vinyl alcohol\/dimethyl sulfoxidemRS, modified Rankin ScaleSAC, single arterial approachSRS, stereotactic radiosurgeryTVA, transvenous approach.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f6100082b6","authors":["Mendes, George A C","Silveira, Eduardo Pedrolo","Caire, Fran\u00e7ois","Boncoeur Martel, Marie-Paule","Saleme, Suzana","Iosif, Christina","Mounayer, Charbel"],"doi":"10.1227\/neu.0000000000000982","first_seen_on":"2015-09-02T00:57:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1524-4040"],"journal":"Neurosurgery","last_mentioned_on":1452531343,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26317676?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26317676\/"],"pmid":"26317676","pubdate":"2015-09-02T22:03:38+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurosurgery"],"title":"Endovascular Management of Deep Arteriovenous Malformations: Single Institution Experience in 22 Consecutive Patients.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/endovascular-management-deep-arteriovenous-malformations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6938388,"mean":6.2242844220111,"rank":2701187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4134849,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6938388,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":225004,"mean":8.8333150669104,"rank":82117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":138599,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":225004,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1720,"mean":5.1263990692263,"rank":766,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":914,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1720,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65,"mean":8.45021875,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FI":1,"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TC_papers\/statuses\/638878282906120192","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4462471],"posted_on":"2015-09-02T00:57:07+00:00","author":{"name":"TC_papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507539334375829504\/IcPjrJI3_normal.jpeg","description":"Pubmed twitterbot: arealization OR patterning OR somatosensory OR thalamus OR thalamocortical OR cortical development","id_on_source":"TC_papers","tweeter_id":"2789910212","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":178},"tweet_id":"638878282906120192"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MKorja\/statuses\/686583992003465217","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4462471],"posted_on":"2016-01-11T16:22:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Miikka Korja","url":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/miikka-korja-956878120","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/673091567700172800\/bGSbS_rL_normal.jpg","description":"Specialist & A\/Prof in neurosurgery (Helsinki University Hospital).
