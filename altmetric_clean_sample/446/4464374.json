Here we used high throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to explore the global transcriptomic response and specific involvement of a suite of hemocyanin (Hc) subunits to low O2 alone and in combination with high CO2, which naturally co-occurs with low O2. Hepatopancreas mRNA of juvenile L.vannamei exposed to air-saturated water, low O2, or low O2\/high CO2 for 4 or 24 h was sequenced and assembled to create a deep strand-specific reference transcriptome. Annotation of the assembly revealed sequences encoding the previously described small Hc subunit (HcS), and three full-length isoforms of the large subunit (HcL1-3). In addition to this, a previously unidentified full-length Hc subunit was discovered. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the new subunit to be a \u03b2-type Hc subunit (denoted HcB), making this the first report of a \u03b2-type hemocyanin subunit in the Penaeoidea. RNAs of individual shrimp were sequenced; regulated genes identified from pairwise comparisons demonstrated a distinct pattern of regulation between prolonged low O2 and low O2\/high CO2 treatments by GO term enrichment analysis (Roff- Bentzen; p < 0.0001), showcasing the stabilization of energetically costly translational machinery, mobilization of energy stores, and downregulation of the ubiquitin\/proteasomal degradation machinery. Exposure to hypoxia for 24 h resulted in an increase in all of the full-length hemocyanin subunits (HcS, HcL1, HcL2, HcL3, and HcB). The addition of CO2 to hypoxia muted the transcriptomic response of all the Hc subunits to low O2, except for the \u03b2-type subunit.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003322","authors":["Jillian G.
