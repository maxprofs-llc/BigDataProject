The major cause of severe visual loss in patients with AS is choroidal neovascularization (CNV). We report the optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) findings of CNV in a patient with PXE and angioid streaks. A 51-year-old man with PXE presented with visual disturbance in his right eye. Best corrected visual acuity was 20\/30 OD and 20\/30 OS. Funduscopic examination revealed angioid streaks and type 1 NV in his right eye. Multimodal imaging including OCTA demonstrated CNV nasal to the fovea. The morphology and configuration of CNV followed the path of the AS. OCTA combined with other multimodal imaging modalities may be a useful tool for diagnosing CNV secondary to angioid streaks in patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum. The configuration of CNV in these may follow the path of angioid streaks implicating Bruch's membrane disruption as an important anatomical change in the pathogenesis of CNV.","altmetric_jid":"56b367fb2a83eea9718b4968","authors":["Orly Gal-Or","Chandrakumar Balaratnasingam","K B Freund"],"doi":"10.1186\/s40942-015-0011-x","first_seen_on":"2015-09-03T07:17:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2056-9920"],"journal":"International Journal of Retina and Vitreous ","last_mentioned_on":1440934493,"links":["http:\/\/www.journalretinavitreous.com\/content\/1\/1\/11"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.journalretinavitreous.com\/content\/pdf\/s40942-015-0011-x.pdf","pmid":"27847604","pubdate":"2015-08-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","scheme":"springer"}],"title":"Optical coherence tomography angiography findings of choroidal neovascularization in pseudoxanthoma elasticum","type":"article","volume":"1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/optical-coherence-tomography-angiography-findings-choroidal-neovascularization-pseudoxanthoma-elasti-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5569696,"mean":6.3872638677711,"rank":4638477,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5569696,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193628,"mean":9.5358054403569,"rank":155106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193628,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":0.39130434782609,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"EG":1,"PL":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Optical coherence tomography angiography findings of choroidal neovascularization in...","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=634020790073018&id=570892786385819","license":"public","citation_ids":[4467227],"posted_on":"2015-08-30T11:34:53+00:00","summary":"http:\/\/www.journalretinavitreous.com\/content\/1\/1\/11","author":{"name":"International Journal of Retina and Vitreous","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/570892786385819","facebook_wall_name":"International Journal of Retina and Vitreous","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/570892786385819\/picture","id_on_source":"570892786385819"}}]}}
