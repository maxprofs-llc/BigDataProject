To determine test-retest reliability, 241 of the participants completed the Japanese version of the BEQ again approximately 1 month after initial surveying was completed.\nCronbach's alpha coefficients were 0.83 for the BEQ full scale, and 0.61-0.77 for subscales. Test-retest correlations were 0.61 for the full scale, and 0.57-0.61 for subscales. Construct validity was demonstrated by correlations between BEQ scores and scores on measures of emotional expressivity, self-monitoring, self-esteem, depression, \"Big Five\" (neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness) personality traits, and emotional control.\nThe Japanese version of the BEQ has adequate internal consistency, reliability, and construct validity. Test-retest reliability was lower than that of the original scale. This study was the first in Japan to develop a self-rating questionnaire assessing multiple facets of emotional expressivity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f6100059d3","authors":["Lin, Mingming","Soi-Kawase, Sayaka","Narita-Ohtaki, Ryoko","Itoh, Mariko","Kim, Yoshiharu","Soi\u2010Kawase, Sayaka","Narita\u2010Ohtaki, Ryoko"],"doi":"10.1111\/jjns.12094","endpage":"201","first_seen_on":"2015-09-02T10:10:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1742-7924"],"issue":"1","journal":"Japan journal of nursing science : JJNS.","last_mentioned_on":1441188626,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/jjns.12094"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jjns.12094\/pdf","pmid":"26333194","pubdate":"2015-09-04T22:01:21+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"196","subjects":["nursing"],"title":"Reliability and validity of a self\u2010report emotional expressivity measure: The Japanese version of the Berkeley Expressivity Questionnaire","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reliability-validity-selfreport-emotional-expressivity-measure-japanese-version-berkeley-expressivit"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6420611,"mean":5.9912694360814,"rank":5473133,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6420611,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190216,"mean":9.6888281891544,"rank":152091,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190216,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":1.1297619047619,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1},"mendeley":{"PT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/639017529684262912","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4463614],"posted_on":"2015-09-02T10:10:26+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":964},"tweet_id":"639017529684262912"}]}}
