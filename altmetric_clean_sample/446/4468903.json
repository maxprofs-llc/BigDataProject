Cumulative evidence indicates that IL-6 production by HNSCC cells and\/or stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment activates STAT3 and contributes to tumor progression and drug resistance. A library of 94,491 compounds from the Molecular Library Screening Center Network (MLSCN) was screened for the ability to inhibit interleukin-6 (IL-6)-induced pSTAT3 activation. For contractual reasons, the primary high-content screening (HCS) campaign was conducted over several months in 3 distinct phases; 1,068 (1.1%) primary HCS actives remained after cytotoxic or fluorescent outliers were eliminated. One thousand one hundred eighty-seven compounds were cherry-picked for confirmation; actives identified in the primary HCS and compounds selected by a structural similarity search of the remaining MLSCN library using hits identified in phases I and II of the screen. Actives were confirmed in pSTAT3 IC50 assays, and an IFN\u03b3-induced pSTAT1 activation assay was used to prioritize selective inhibitors of STAT3 activation that would not inhibit STAT1 tumor suppressor functions. Two hundred three concentration-dependent inhibitors of IL-6-induced pSTAT3 activation were identified and 89 of these also produced IC50s against IFN-\u03b3-induced pSTAT1 activation. Forty-nine compounds met our hit criteria: they reproducibly inhibited IL-6-induced pSTAT3 activation by \u226570% at 20\u2009\u03bcM; their pSTAT3 activation IC50s were \u226425\u2009\u03bcM; they were \u22652-fold selective for pSTAT3 inhibition over pSTAT1 inhibition; a cross target query of PubChem indicated that they were not biologically promiscuous; and they were \u226590% pure. Twenty-six chemically tractable hits that passed filters for nuisance compounds and had acceptable drug-like and ADME-Tox properties by computational evaluation were purchased for characterization. The hit structures were distributed among 5 clusters and 8 singletons. Twenty-four compounds inhibited IL-6-induced pSTAT3 activation with IC50s \u226420\u2009\u03bcM and 13 were \u22653-fold selective versus inhibition of pSTAT1 activation. Eighteen hits inhibited the growth of HNSCC cell lines with average IC50s \u2264 20\u2009\u03bcM. Four chemical series were progressed into lead optimization: the guanidinoquinazolines, the triazolothiadiazines, the amino alcohols, and an oxazole-piperazine singleton.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006b74","authors":["JohnstonPaul A.","Johnston, Paul A","Sen, Malabika","Hua, Yun","Camarco, Daniel P","Shun, Tong Ying","Lazo, John S","Wilson, Gabriela Mustata","Resnick, Lynn O","LaPorte, Matthew G","Wipf, Peter","Huryn, Donna M","Grandis, Jennifer R"],"doi":"10.1089\/adt.2015.663","endpage":"376","first_seen_on":"2015-09-03T17:07:27+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci","phs"],"issns":["1557-8127","1540-658X"],"issue":"7","journal":"Assay and Drug Development Technologies","last_mentioned_on":1441302735,"links":["http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1089\/adt.2015.663"],"pmid":"26317883","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"356","subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"HCS Campaign to Identify Selective Inhibitors of IL-6-Induced STAT3 Pathway Activation in Head and Neck Cancer Cell Lines","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hcs-campaign-identify-selective-inhibitors-il6induced-stat3-pathway-activation-head-neck-cancer-cell"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5974186,"mean":6.0510067910469,"rank":2228326,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":3709474,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5974186,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193842,"mean":9.5365172589905,"rank":70909,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":120705,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193842,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114,"mean":5.1286725663717,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":73,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":3.375,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
