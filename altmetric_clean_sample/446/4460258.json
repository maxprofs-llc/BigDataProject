Conventional antioxidant therapies have been less effective in preventing neuronal damage caused by oxidative stress due to their inability to cross the blood brain barrier. Nanoparticle antioxidants constitute a new wave of antioxidant therapies for prevention and treatment of diseases involving oxidative stress. It is believed that nanoparticle antioxidants will have strong and persistent interactions with biomolecules would be more effective against free radical induced damage. Nanoantioxidants include inorganic nanoparticles possessing intrinsic antioxidant properties, nanoparticles functionalized with antioxidants or antioxidant enzymes to function as an antioxidant delivery system. Nanoparticles containing antioxidants have shown promise as high-performance therapeutic nanomedicine in attenuating oxidative stress with potential applications in treating and preventing neurodegenerative conditions. However, to realize the full potential of nanoantioxidants, negative aspects associated with the use of nanoparticles need to be overcome to validate their long term applications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f610003192","authors":["Sandhir, Rajat","Yadav, Aarti","Sunkaria, Aditya","Singhal, Nitin"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neuint.2015.08.011","first_seen_on":"2015-09-01T15:48:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1872-9754"],"journal":"Neurochemistry International","last_mentioned_on":1448655169,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26315960?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26315960"],"pmid":"26315960","pubdate":"2015-09-01T22:02:40+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["chemistry","neurology"],"title":"Nano-antioxidants: An emerging strategy for intervention against neurodegenerative conditions.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nanoantioxidants-emerging-strategy-intervention-against-neurodegenerative-conditions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6613942,"mean":6.1334676036573,"rank":573511,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":6037107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6613942,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":199881,"mean":9.6231905543328,"rank":27646,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":172016,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":199881,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":532,"mean":2.9617627118644,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":510,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":532,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":5.69125,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
