Iron species 1 was prepared by reacting {Ar(iPr8)Fe(\u03b7(6)-benzene)} with N2O or O2, and cobalt species 2 was prepared by reacting {Ar(iPr8)Co(\u03b7(6)-toluene)} with O2. Both 1 and 2 were characterized by X-ray crystallography, UV-vis spectroscopy, magnetic measurements, and, in the case of 1, M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy. The solid-state structures of both compounds reveal unique M2(\u03bc-O)2 (M = Fe (1), Co(2)) cores with formally three-coordinate metal ions. The Fe\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Fe separation in 1 bears a resemblance to that in the Fe2(\u03bc-O)2 diamond core proposed for the methane monooxygenase intermediate Q. The structural differences between 1 and 2 are reflected in rather differing magnetic behavior. Compound 2 is thermally unstable, and its decomposition at room temperature resulted in the oxidation of the Ar(iPr8) ligand via oxygen insertion and addition to the central aryl ring of the terphenyl ligand to produce the 5,5'-peroxy-bis[4,6-(i)Pr2-3,7-bis(2,4,6-(i)Pr3-phenyl)oxepin-2(5H)-one] (3). The structure of the oxidized terphenyl species is closely related to that of a key intermediate proposed for the oxidation of benzene.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Pei Zhao"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.5b00930","first_seen_on":"2015-09-02T16:28:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-510X"],"journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1441361883,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.5b00930","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.5b00930?utm_content=buffer6a390&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26331405?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26331405","pubdate":"2015-09-04T10:19:11+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Quasi-Three-Coordinate Iron and Cobalt Terphenoxide Complexes {Ar(iPr8)OM(\u03bc-O)}2 (Ar(iPr8) = C6H-2,6-(C6H2-2,4,6-(i)Pr3)2-3,5-(i)Pr2; M = Fe or Co) with M(III)2(\u03bc-O)2 Core Structures and the Peroxide Dimer of 2-Oxepinoxy Relevant to Benzene Oxidation.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quasithreecoordinate-iron-cobalt-terphenoxide-complexes-ar-sup-iii-pr-sub8sub-sup-om%CE%BCo-sub2sub-ar-su"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6251511,"mean":5.8319631004321,"rank":2572892,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3537952,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6251511,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193727,"mean":9.5329686980579,"rank":86734,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":100462,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193727,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7791,"mean":1.0535761232349,"rank":1344,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6189,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7791,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":327,"mean":1.1664110429448,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":251,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":327,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
