All patients had over 3 years of follow up (except one). The clinical results were assessed using AOFAS, WOMAC, SF-36 and patient satisfaction scores.\nThe mean follow up was 3 years. There was significant improvement in AOFAS and WOMAC (pain and stiffness) from pre-op to 3 years post-op (P<0.05). SF 36 scores improved from pre-op to 3 years post-op for 6\/8 domains. 5 patients were satisfied at 3 years for overall surgical outcomes, 4 were satisfied with pain relief. Radiological signs of talar subsidence were noted in 2 patients at year 1. This did not progress at 3 years and did not deteriorate clinical outcome.\nWe recommend our two staged approach to deal with this difficult clinical problem. We believe this approach is safe for TAR surgery where talar vascularity and bone quality is questionable leading to reduced talar subsidence, ischaemic pain and improvement in longevity of TAR.\nEvidence IV (Retrospective case series).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f6100058ed","authors":["Devalia, Kailash L","Ramaskandhan, Jayasree","Muthumayandi, Karthikeyan","Siddique, Malik"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.foot.2015.07.001","endpage":"205","first_seen_on":"2015-09-02T12:08:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0958-2592","1532-2963","09582592"],"issue":"4","journal":"Foot","last_mentioned_on":1441195711,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0958259215000565"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.thefootjournal.com\/article\/S0958259215000565\/pdf","pmid":"26363580","pubdate":"2015-09-14T22:00:19+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"200","subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Early results of a novel technique: Hindfoot fusion in talus osteonecrosis prior to ankle arthroplasty: A case series","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/early-results-novel-technique-hindfoot-fusion-talus-osteonecrosis-prior-ankle-arthroplasty-case-seri"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5581375,"mean":6.3956278884028,"rank":2954165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1885617,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5581375,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193600,"mean":9.5335902251562,"rank":104887,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":69511,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193600,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":2.3157045454545,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.4875,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Psychology":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Environmental Science":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/KarthikUOK\/statuses\/639047249155227648","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4463975],"posted_on":"2015-09-02T12:08:31+00:00","author":{"name":"karthik","url":"https:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/profiles\/karthikeyan-muthumayandi\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/639027390560268288\/9b7ppO0l_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"KarthikUOK","tweeter_id":"20178239","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":98},"tweet_id":"639047249155227648"}]}}
