Cigarette smoke causes multiple inflammatory diseases, which account for thousands of deaths and cost billions of dollars annually. Cigarette smoke disrupts the function of immune cells, such as macrophages, by prolonging inflammatory signaling, promoting oxidative stress, and impairing phagocytosis, contributing to increased incidence of infections. Recently, new families of lipid derived-mediators coined \"specialized pro-resolving mediators\" (SPMs) were identified. These mediators play a critical role in the active resolution of inflammation by counter-regulating pro-inflammatory signaling and promoting resolution pathways. Here, we identified dysregulated concentrations of lipid mediators in exhaled breath condensate, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and serum from COPD patients. In human alveolar macrophages from COPD and non-COPD patients, D-series resolvins decreased inflammatory cytokines and enhanced phagocytosis. To further investigate the actions of resolvins on human cells, macrophages were differentiated from human blood monocytes and treated with D-series resolvins followed by exposure to cigarette smoke extract. Resolvins significantly suppressed macrophage production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, enzymes, and lipid mediators. Resolvins also increased anti-inflammatory cytokines, promoted an M2 macrophage phenotype, and restored cigarette smoke-induced defects in phagocytosis, highlighting the pro-resolving functions of these molecules. These actions were receptor dependent and involved modulation of canonical and non-canonical NF-\u03baB expression, with the first evidence for SPM action on alternative NF-\u03baB signaling. These data show that resolvins act on human macrophages to attenuate cigarette smoke-induced inflammatory effects through pro-resolving mechanisms, and provide new evidence of the therapeutic potential of SPMs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002211","authors":["Amanda Croasdell","Thomas H Thatcher","Robert Matthew Kottmann","Romain A Colas","Jesmond Dalli","Charles N.
