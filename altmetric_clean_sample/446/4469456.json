Data were pooled for 2006 to 2012, and negative binomial regressions conducted with adjustment to estimate a union safety effect.\nThe sample included 5797 unionized and 38,626 nonunion construction firms. Total claims rates were 13% higher (1.13, 1.09 to 1.18) in unionized firms because of higher allowed no-lost-time claim rates (1.28, 1.23 to 1.34), whereas the lost-time claims rate was 14% lower (0.86, 0.82 to 0.91).\nUnionized construction firms compared with nonunion firms have higher no-lost-time and lower lost-time claims rates. Unionized firms may encourage occupational injury reporting and reduce risks through training and hazard identification and control strategies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e91","authors":["Amick, Benjamin C","Hogg-Johnson, Sheilah","Latour-Villamil, Desiree","Saunders, Ron","Amick, Benjamin C.
