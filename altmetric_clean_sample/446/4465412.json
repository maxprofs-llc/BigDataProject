The infrared spectra of 136 taproots of P. notoginseng from 13 planting point in 11 counties were collected and the second derivate spectra were calculated by Omnic 8. 0 software. The infrared spectra and their second derivate spectra in the range 1 800 - 700 cm-1 were used to build model by stepwise discriminant analysis, which was in order to distinguish study on the genuineness of P. notoginseng. The model built based on the second derivate spectra showed the better recognition effect for the genuineness of P. notoginseng. The correct rate of returned classification reached to 100%, and the prediction accuracy was 93. 4%. The stability of model was tested by cross validation and the method was performed extrapolation validation. The second derivate spectra combined with the same discriminant analysis method were used to distinguish the producing area of P. notoginseng. The recognition effect of models built based on different range of spectrum and different numbers of samples were compared and found that when the model was built by collecting 8 samples from each planting point as training sample and the spectrum in the range 1 500 - 1 200 cm-1 , the recognition effect was better, with the correct rate of returned classification reached to 99. 0%, and the prediction accuracy was 76. 5%. The results indicated that infrared spectroscopy combined with discriminant analysis showed good recognition effect for the genuineness of P. notoginseng. The method might be a hopeful new method for identification of genuineness of P. notoginseng in practice. The method could recognize the producing area of P. notoginseng to some extent and could be a new thought for identification of the producing area of P. natoginseng.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9213cf058f61000d827","authors":["Liu, Fei","Wang, Yuan-zhong","Yang, Chun-yan","Jin, Hang"],"first_seen_on":"2015-09-02T19:29:24+00:00","issns":["1000-0593"],"issue":"1","journal":"Guang pu xue yu guang pu fen xi Guang pu","last_mentioned_on":1441222145,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25993830?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25993830","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"[Study on the genuineness and producing area of Panax notoginseng based on infrared spectroscopy combined with discriminant analysis].","type":"article","volume":"35"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5581375,"mean":6.3956278884028,"rank":4649456,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5581375,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193601,"mean":9.5335422727274,"rank":155174,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193601,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":139,"mean":0.47536231884058,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":139,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RootPapers\/statuses\/639158121630339073","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4465412],"posted_on":"2015-09-02T19:29:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Root Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/447736797422813184\/Q7OqMgVA_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Plant Root papers in #PubMed, #arXiv, #Bioarxiv and #PeerJ Preprints.
