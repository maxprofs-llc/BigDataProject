See our comments"],"citation":{"abstract":"Instead of converging to one, all-embracing resilience mechanism - that is, positive appraisal style - we encourage complementary research strategies, exploring both vulnerabilities and resilience factors, much like the biomedical sciences combine insights from pathophysiology and immunology. Furthermore, we argue that research with a strong focus on one central resilience mechanism may overlook or undervalue other processes that can aid in maintaining mental health.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023a1","authors":["Luyten, Laura","Boddez, Yannick","Hermans, Dirk"],"doi":"10.1017\/s0140525x14001629","first_seen_on":"2015-09-03T09:46:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1469-1825"],"journal":"Behavioral & Brain Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1441273575,"links":["http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/action\/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=9933470&fulltextType=RA&fileId=S0140525X14001629&treatment=Y&subcompId=9933470&treatmentType=COM"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/article_S0140525X14001629","pmid":"26787100","pubdate":"2016-01-21T22:01:05+00:00","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Artificial Intelligence And Image Processing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"e112","subjects":["brain","psychology","neurology"],"title":"Positive appraisal style: The mental immune system?","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/positive-appraisal-style-mental-immune-system"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5942079,"mean":6.0781231306575,"rank":2959796,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1888859,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5942079,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193842,"mean":9.5364507096021,"rank":104944,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":69676,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193842,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":950,"mean":8.3971949420442,"rank":451,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":424,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":950,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":4.2586060606061,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
