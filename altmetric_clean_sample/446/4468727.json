Activated BRAF mutants evade feedback inhibition of RAS by either of two mechanisms. BRAF V600 mutants are activated monomers when RAS activity is low; all other activating BRAF mutants function as constitutive RAS-independent dimers. RAF inhibitors effectively inhibit mutant monomers, but not dimers; their binding to one site in the dimer significantly reduces their affinity for the second. Tumors with non-V600E BRAF mutants are insensitive to these drugs, and increased expression of BRAF V600E dimers causes acquired resistance. A compound that equally inhibits both sites of mutant RAF dimers inhibits tumors driven by either class of mutants or those BRAF V600E tumors with dimer-dependent acquired resistance to monomer-specific inhibitors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002496","authors":["Yao, Zhan","Torres, Neilawattie M","Tao, Anthony","Gao, Yijun","Luo, Lusong","Li, Qi","de Stanchina, Elisa","Abdel-Wahab, Omar","Solit, David B","Poulikakos, Poulikos I","Rosen, Neal"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ccell.2015.08.001","endpage":"383","first_seen_on":"2015-09-03T15:52:00+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1535-6108","1878-3686","15356108"],"issue":"3","journal":"Cancer Cell","last_mentioned_on":1447718400,"links":["http:\/\/www.cell.com\/cancer-cell\/abstract\/S1535-6108(15)00292-5?rss=yes&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.cell.com\/cancer-cell\/abstract\/S1535-6108(15)00292-5","http:\/\/www.cell.com\/cancer-cell\/abstract\/S1535-6108%2815%2900292-5","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26343582","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ccell.2015.08.001"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S1535610815002925\/pdf","pmid":"26343582","pubdate":"2015-09-08T22:00:32+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"370","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"BRAF Mutants Evade ERK-Dependent Feedback by Different Mechanisms that Determine Their Sensitivity to Pharmacologic Inhibition","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/braf-mutants-evade-erkdependent-feedback-different-mechanisms-determine-sensitivity-pharmacologic-in"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6614309,"mean":6.1341976566561,"rank":1314877,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":5261650,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6614309,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":199196,"mean":9.6424219885039,"rank":53141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":145484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":199196,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1400,"mean":14.014295925661,"rank":612,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":752,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1400,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":16.815820895522,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":26,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
