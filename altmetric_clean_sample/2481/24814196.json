The cross-sectional study was performed to investigate the association between NAFLD and coronary artery calcification (CAC) in individuals from northern city of China. A total of 2345 participants aged \u226540 (1035 men and 1310 women) were selected from the Jidong community of Tangshan city. Liver ultrasonography was used to the diagnosis of NAFLD. A 64-slice CT scanner was used to determine coronary artery calcification score (CACS), with CACS\u2009>\u20090 defined to be the presence of CAC. The risk level of coronary heart disease (CHD) was graded by CACS according to the 4 commonly used thresholds in clinical practice (0, 10, 100, and 400 Agatston units). NAFLD was significantly associated with CAC (crude OR: 1.631, 95% CI: 1.295-2.053, adjusted OR: 1.348, 95% CI: 1.030-1.765). The association between NAFLD and increased risk level of CHD (Crude OR: 1.639 95% CI: 1.303-2.063; adjusted OR: 1.359 95% CI: 1.043-1.770) was observed. The associations between NAFLD and CAC or increased risk level of CHD were significant in female but not in male. Our finding further confirmed the association between NAFLD and CAC, especially in Asian population.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Rina Wu","Feng Hou","Xiaomin Wang","Yong Zhou","Kai Sun","Youxin Wang","Henghui Liu","Jing Wu","Ruiping Zhao","Jiang Hu"],"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-017-09851-5","first_seen_on":"2017-09-05T14:10:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"issue":"1","journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1504620635,"links":["https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-09851-5?WT.ec_id=SREP-692-20170905&spMailingID=54852248&spUserID=MTIyMzE1MzE5MjU2S0&spJobID=1243304470&spReportId=MTI0MzMwNDQ3MAS2"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-09851-5.pdf","pmid":"28855585","pubdate":"2017-08-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","startpage":"9933","subjects":["science"],"title":"Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Coronary Artery Calcification in a Northern Chinese Population: a Cross Sectional Study","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-coronary-artery-calcification-northern-chinese-population-cross-sec"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366342,"mean":7.0541652571821,"rank":4462305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2329062,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366342,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117794,"mean":12.053055886173,"rank":63460,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":42478,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117794,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36959,"mean":14.723539585475,"rank":21517,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":12156,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36959,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2578,"mean":11.649507954986,"rank":1441,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":925,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2578,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IngaSanders5\/statuses\/905070661240070144","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24814196],"posted_on":"2017-09-05T14:10:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Donna Sanders","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/893470474080047104\/iPacEs76_normal.jpg","description":"MD, Anesthisiolgist, and more, Black belt in Kung-fu Wushu  Film entusiast, mostly action and Hong-Kong made MMA films.
