The primary difficulties in undertaking these analyses have been 1) the lack of information on health expenditures and 2) not using existing information to improve the planning and management of health sector resources. The principle sources of available health expenditure information are reported by organizations such as the World Bank, WHO, UNICEF and OECD. Special studies and non-routine information are a second major source of information. This existing data has a number of difficulties, including being sporadic, inconsistency, inclusion of only national level public expenditure, high opportunity and maintenance costs, quantitative and qualitative differences across countries, and validity and interpretability problems. Reliable health expenditure data would be useful not only for in-country, national purposes, but also for cross-national comparisons and for development agencies. Country uses of health expenditure data include policy formulation and planning and management, while international uses would facilitate examination of cross-national comparisons, reviews of existing programmes and identification of funding priorities. Collaborative efforts between countries and international development agencies, as well as between agencies, are needed to establish guidelines for health expenditure data sets. This development must ensure that the resulting information is of direct benefit to countries, as well as to agencies. Results of such collaborative efforts may include a set of standardized methodologies and tools; standardized national health accounts for developing countries; and training to enhance national capabilities to actively use the information. The opportunities for such collaboration are unique with the issuance of the World Development Report 1993, to build on this work in clearly identifying what is needed and proposing a standardized data set and the tools necessary to regularly and economically gather such data.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5933cf058f610004f68","authors":["WILLIAM NEWBRANDER","GUY CARRIN","DANIEL LE TOUZE"],"doi":"10.1093\/heapol\/9.4.396","endpage":"408","first_seen_on":"2017-01-10T16:39:17+00:00","issns":["0268-1080","1460-2237"],"issue":"4","journal":"Health Policy & Planning","last_mentioned_on":946684800,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/heapol\/9.4.396"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/heapol.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/9\/4\/396.full.pdf","pmid":"10139472","pubdate":"1994-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Policy And Administration","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"396","subjects":["healthservicesresearch","publichealth"],"title":"Developing countries' health expenditure information: what exists and what is needed?","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/developing-countries-health-expenditure-information-exists-needed"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6935800,"mean":6.2219313630607,"rank":1618540,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":4532539,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6935800,"percentile":65},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93508,"mean":10.823129198884,"rank":27890,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":64336,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93508,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":966,"mean":6.6377886010363,"rank":464,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":293,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":966,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":7.28,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
