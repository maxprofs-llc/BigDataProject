This study examined the effect of routine pulse oximetry measurements on emergency department (ED) triage classification. Using a portable pulse oximeter, oxygen saturation of 1,235 adults presenting to a university-based, urban ED was obtained and each patient was assigned a classification of severity based on a standard 1-to-4 scale before and after the measurement. According to data obtained, a small but statistically significant group (2.8%) benefitted from the routine use of pulse oximetry in an emergency triage system and only 40% of these patients required admission or extended care. Although this group is small in number, the potential consequences of missing a hypoxic condition could be devastating for the individual patient. Since pulse oximetry is presently an inexpensive technology, it would seem to be a worthwhile screening tool for emergency triage.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005704","authors":["Summers, R L","Anders, R M","Woodward, L H","Jenkins, A K","Galli, R L","Richard L Summers","Robert M Anders","Louann H Woodward","Aryanna K Jenkins","Robert L Galli"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0735-6757(98)90056-0","endpage":"7","first_seen_on":"2017-01-10T14:04:47+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["0735-6757","07356757"],"issue":"1","journal":"American Journal of Emergency Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1265530409,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0735-6757(98)90056-0"],"pmid":"9451305","pubdate":"1998-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"5","subjects":["emergencymedicine"],"title":"Effect of routine pulse oximetry measurements on ED triage classification","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-routine-pulse-oximetry-measurements-ed-triage-classification"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6932848,"mean":6.2215301999287,"rank":1618055,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":4532240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6932848,"percentile":65},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93129,"mean":10.811343054721,"rank":27739,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":64109,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93129,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2185,"mean":4.6730192307692,"rank":704,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":1350,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2185,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":1.1576923076923,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Social Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"policy":[{"title":"Validity of pulse oximetry in detection of hypoxaemia in children: comparison of ear, thumb and toe probe placements","url":"http:\/\/apps.who.int\/iris\/bitstream\/10665\/117846\/1\/16_2_2010_0218_0222.pdf","license":"public","citation_ids":[15362054,15362074,15362076,15362095,15362096,3030357,15362127,15362148,15362149,15362163,15362164],"posted_on":"2010-02-07T08:13:29+00:00","source":{"name":"World Health Organization","description":"The World Health Organization (WHO) is the directing and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations system.","geo":{"country":"CH"}},"page_url":"http:\/\/apps.who.int\/iris\/handle\/10665\/117846","collections":[],"author":{"image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/cache.altmetric.com\/policy\/thumbnails\/thumbnail-2ac8fb9221102a7f1ecf0d24f232d4321c93e3ede27fcd268e7dd57d1f0f12d8.jpg"}}]}}
