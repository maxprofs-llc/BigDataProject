We assessed the impact of histologic subtypes on oncologic outcomes after PN in patients with pathologic T1a RCC (median follow-up duration, 67\u00a0months).\nThere was no difference in patient and tumor characteristics between the 2 groups, except Fuhrman grade (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006). Kaplan-Meier analysis identified 5-year recurrence-free survival of 98.7 and 95.6% in patients with ccRCC and pRCC, respectively. However, 10-year recurrence-free survival in patients with ccRCC and pRCC was 96.1 and 73.0%, respectively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Recurrence\u00a0\u22655 years post surgery was more common in patients with pRCC compared with those with ccRCC (0.3 vs. 4.8%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In multivariate analysis, pRCC [hazard ratio (HR) 5.309; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001] was a significant risk factor for recurrence after PN in patients with pathologic T1a RCC, in addition to larger tumor size (HR 1.861; p\u00a0=\u00a00.038) and Fuhrman grade\u00a0\u22653 (HR 5.176; p\u00a0=\u00a00.003).\nIn patients with pathologic T1a RCC, recurrence after PN occurred more commonly in pRCC compared with ccRCC. As over half of the recurrence cases in patients with pRCC occurred\u00a0\u22655\u00a0years post surgery, a longer follow-up time is required, even for those with pathologic stage T1a disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cda","authors":["Sangjun Yoo","Dalsan You","In Gab Jeong","Cheryn Song","Bumsik Hong","Jun Hyuk Hong","Hanjong Ahn","Choung-Soo Kim"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00432-017-2430-6","first_seen_on":"2017-06-19T08:01:12+00:00","issns":["0171-5216","1432-1335"],"journal":"Journal of Cancer Research & Clinical Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1497866650,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28451753\/?i=5&from=T1b%20renal%20cell%20carcinoma"],"pmid":"28451753","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Hematology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Histologic subtype needs to be considered after partial nephrectomy in patients with pathologic T1a renal cell carcinoma: papillary vs. clear cell renal cell carcinoma","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/histologic-subtype-needs-considered-after-partial-nephrectomy-patients-pathologic-t1a-renal-cell-car"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8392157,"mean":7.0686031077041,"rank":4480000,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2335868,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8392157,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236835,"mean":12.912113792783,"rank":131662,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":83130,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236835,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":635,"mean":2.4378107255521,"rank":294,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":272,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":635,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.9673913043478,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"TR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/mfaurology\/statuses\/876711391167688704","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21165492],"posted_on":"2017-06-19T08:00:58+00:00","author":{"name":"Mehmet Fatih Akbulut","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/749193315707392000\/BI0igLXZ_normal.jpg","description":"Associate Professor of Urology, FECSM, FEBU","id_on_source":"mfaurology","tweeter_id":"740231988712464385","geo":{"lt":41.03508,"ln":28.98331,"country":"TR"},"followers":128},"tweet_id":"876711391167688704"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TuncaySARI\/statuses\/876742394628145152","license":"gnip","rt":["mfaurology"],"citation_ids":[21165492],"posted_on":"2017-06-19T10:04:10+00:00","author":{"name":"TuncaySARI","url":"http:\/\/www.tutkusaglik.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/848870809099788290\/JVRz209P_normal.jpg","description":"Experienced Medical Device Marketing Professional and a Happy Father.","id_on_source":"TuncaySARI","tweeter_id":"29993773","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1181},"tweet_id":"876742394628145152"}]}}
