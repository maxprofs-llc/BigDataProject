The aim of this review was to analyze published longitudinal studies including MM patients according to a change in HRQoL scores, which is perceived as beneficial to the patient according to two published guidelines.\nA literature search was performed May 2016. Publications with longitudinal follow-up using the EORTC QLQ-C30 instrument for HRQoL measurement of physical functioning, global quality of life, fatigue and\/or pain were included. An analysis of mean change from baseline was carried out according to minimal important difference (MID).\nLarge and medium HRQoL improvements were reported during first-line treatments. No clinically beneficial change or deteriorations in scores of global QoL or fatigue were reported during relapse treatment. HRQoL data during maintenance therapy are sparse and inconclusive.\nGuidelines for interpreting changes in HRQoL including definitions of MID have been developed, however consensus is missing. Improvements in HRQoL are far more likely to occur during first-line compared to relapsed treatment regimens. The background of these findings should be in focus in future studies and HRQoL measurements should be integrated in maintenance studies. This article is protected by copyright.
