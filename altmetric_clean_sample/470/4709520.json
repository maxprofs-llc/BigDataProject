There are 3 main management problems: tumor control, neurological loss, and pelvic instability. The objective of this study was to examine oncological, neurological, and structural outcomes of sacral GCT after intralesional excision and local intraoperative adjunctive treatment. METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed the records of 24 patients with sacral GCT who underwent conservative surgery (intralesional resection\/curettage) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center from 1973 through 2012. They analyzed patient demographic data, tumor characteristics, and operative techniques, and examined possible correlations with postoperative functional outcomes, complications, recurrence, and mortality. RESULTS There were 7 local recurrences (30%) and 3 distant recurrences (13%). Three of 24 patients (12.5%) had significant neurological loss after treatment-specifically, severe bowel and\/or bladder dysfunction, but all regained function within 1-4 years. Larger tumor size (> 320 cm(3)) was associated with greater postoperative neurological loss. Radiation therapy and preoperative embolization were associated with prolonged disease-free survival. There were no local recurrences among the 11 patients who were treated with both modalities. Based on radiographic and clinical assessment, spinopelvic stability was present in 23 of 24 patients at final follow-up. CONCLUSIONS High local and distant recurrence rates associated with sacral GCT suggest the need for careful local and systemic follow-up in managing these patients. Intraoperative preservation of sacral roots was associated with better pain relief, improvement in ambulatory function, and retention of bowel\/bladder function in most patients. Fusion and instrumentation of the sacroiliac joint successfully achieved spinopelvic stability in cases deemed clinically unstable. Despite improvement in the management of sacral GCT over 35 years, a need for novel therapies remains. The strategy of combining radiotherapy and embolization merits further study.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d9a","authors":["Domovitov, Stepan V","Chandhanayingyong, Chandhanarat","Boland, Patrick J","McKeown, David G","Healey, John H"],"doi":"10.3171\/2015.4.spine13215","first_seen_on":"2015-10-31T18:50:35+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1547-5646"],"journal":"Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine","last_mentioned_on":1446317417,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26516662?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26516662","pubdate":"2015-10-31T22:00:31+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurosurgery"],"title":"Conservative surgery in the treatment of giant cell tumor of the sacrum: 35 years' experience.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/conservative-surgery-treatment-giant-cell-tumor-sacrum-35-years-experience"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6510470,"mean":6.0313826788807,"rank":5553623,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6510470,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208018,"mean":10.242967670911,"rank":165753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208018,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":687,"mean":3.3725451895044,"rank":419,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":687,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73,"mean":1.6333333333333,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/660529241184841728","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4709520],"posted_on":"2015-10-31T18:50:17+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":982},"tweet_id":"660529241184841728"}]}}
