In the literature its importance is generally overshadowed by postdural puncture headache. We studied two different kinds of spinal anesthesia needles to compare their technical handling capacities and incidences of PDPB.\nData of 256 pregnant female patients undergoing cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia were collected for the study. Patients were divided into two groups as Group A (n = 109) and Group Q (n = 147) according to the spinal needle used for spinal anesthesia (i.e. 26-gauge atraumatic and 26-gauge Quincke needles, respectively). Backache incidences during a 1-week period postoperatively and handling characteristics of the needles were noted.\nSpinal anesthesia was successfully performed at one attempt in 92.7% and 86.4% of patients in Groups A and Q, respectively. PDPB was encountered in 62.4% and 44.2% of patients in Groups A and Q, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.037).\nBoth 26-gauge Atraucan and Quincke needles have excellent handling characteristics. PDPB seems to be less common with the 26-gauge Quincke needle than with the Atraucan needle.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036c7","authors":["Abdullayev, Ruslan","K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fckebe, Omer Burak","\u00c7elik, B\u00fclent","Kirman, Nihal","Hatipo\u011flu, Hamit Sinan","Akaltun Hatipo\u011flu, Filiz"],"first_seen_on":"2015-10-31T16:24:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1300-0144"],"issue":"4","journal":"Turkish Journal of Medical Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1446308634,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26422861?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26422861","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Does Atraucan cause more postdural puncture backache?","type":"article","volume":"45"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6510470,"mean":6.0313826788807,"rank":5553618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6510470,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208019,"mean":10.242916026498,"rank":165751,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208019,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":162,"mean":1.5837888198758,"rank":85,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":162,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/statuses\/660492348221181952","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4708843],"posted_on":"2015-10-31T16:23:41+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
