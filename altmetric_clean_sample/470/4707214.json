After a single 500 mg intramuscular injection a sustained reduction of serum oestradiol was observed for at least 1 week in all patients in whom the steroid was measured. 4 patients responded to treatment for periods of up to 4 months, and healing of bone metastases and reduction in size of soft-tissue metastases was evident. The only side-effects were pain at the injection site and hot flushes. 4-hydroxyandrostenedione is a new and specific aromatase inhibitor which shows promise in the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008b2a","authors":["Coombes, R C","Goss, P","Dowsett, M","Gazet, J C","Brodie, A"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0140-6736(84)92795-8","first_seen_on":"2015-10-30T21:13:01+00:00","issns":["0140-6736","01406736"],"issue":"8414","journal":"The Lancet","last_mentioned_on":1446225000,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0140673684927958"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.thelancet.com\/article\/S0140673684927958\/pdf","pmid":"6150277","pubdate":"1984-01-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"4-HYDROXYANDROSTENEDIONE IN TREATMENT OF POSTMENOPAUSAL PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED BREAST CANCER ","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/4hydroxyandrostenedione-treatment-postmenopausal-patients-advanced-breast-cancer-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.088,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.088},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6513589,"mean":6.0327236294326,"rank":768645,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":5744611,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6513589,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207166,"mean":10.290424135351,"rank":37204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":169961,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207166,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17837,"mean":26.551291657322,"rank":6966,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":10859,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17837,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":428,"mean":50.560791569087,"rank":269,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":159,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":428,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Our milestones: How anastrozole became a number one hit","url":"http:\/\/scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org\/2015\/10\/30\/our-milestones-how-anastrozole-became-a-number-one-hit\/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+cancerresearchuk%2FSHhE+%28Cancer+Research+UK+-+Science+Update%29","license":"public","citation_ids":[4707213,4707214,4328593],"posted_on":"2015-10-30T17:10:00+00:00","summary":"This entry is part 25 of 25 in the series Our milestonesIn this instalment of our Milestones series, we look at Cancer Research UK&rsquo;s pivotal trials, proving that a drug called anastrozole should be the gold standard for treating breast cancer in post","author":{"name":"Cancer Research UK - Science Update","url":"http:\/\/scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org\/","description":"The latest news, views and opinions from Cancer Research UK"}}]}}
