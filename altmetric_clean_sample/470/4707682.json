However, technological advances in genomics and recent pedagogical research have changed the way in which many medical training programs teach genetics to their students. These advances favor a more experience-based education focused primarily on developing student's critical thinking skills. In this review, we examine the current state of genetics education at both the preclinical and clinical levels and the ways in which medical and pedagogical research have guided reforms to current and emerging teaching practices in genetics. We discover exciting trends taking place in which genetics is integrated with other scientific disciplines both horizontally and vertically across medical curricula to emphasize training in scientific critical thinking skills among students via the evaluation of clinical evidence and consultation of online databases. These trends will produce future health professionals with the skills and confidence necessary to embrace the new tools of medical practice that have emerged from scientific advances in genetics, genomics, and bioinformatics.","authors":["Michael Wolyniak","Lynne Bemis","Amy Prunuske"],"doi":"10.2147\/amep.s73644","first_seen_on":"2015-10-31T02:19:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1179-7258"],"journal":"Advances in Medical Education and Practice","last_mentioned_on":1449005746,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/improving-medical-students39-knowledge-of-genetic-disease-a-review-of--peer-reviewed-article-AMEP","https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/articles.php?article_id=24362","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4629947\/?utm_content=buffer9023b&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4629947\/"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=27754","pmid":"26604852","pubdate":"2015-10-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","title":"Improving medical students\u2019 knowledge of genetic disease: a review of current and emerging pedagogical practices","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/improving-medical-studentsamp39-knowledge-genetic-disease-review-current-emerging-pedagogical-practi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.6},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":4}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/aprunuske\/statuses\/660279838570373121","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4707682],"posted_on":"2015-10-31T02:19:15+00:00","author":{"name":"Amy Prunuske","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/861914992362348545\/jI2Cqjoz_normal.jpg","description":"Medical College of Wisconsin-Central Wisconsin","id_on_source":"aprunuske","tweeter_id":"38971589","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":84},"tweet_id":"660279838570373121"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NevadaMedicine\/statuses\/661313227406614528","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4707682],"posted_on":"2015-11-02T22:45:34+00:00","author":{"name":"UNR Medicine","url":"http:\/\/med.unr.edu","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/762761303341412352\/CufbdJ2Q_normal.jpg","description":"The University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine harnesses the knowledge of our healthcare community to develop compassionate medical professionals.","id_on_source":"NevadaMedicine","tweeter_id":"257531660","geo":{"lt":39.25021,"ln":-116.75119,"country":"US"},"followers":1603},"tweet_id":"661313227406614528"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/KelliJoKuntzman\/statuses\/663831502556282880","license":"gnip","rt":["westr"],"citation_ids":[4707682],"posted_on":"2015-11-09T21:32:18+00:00","author":{"name":"Kelli Jo Kuntzman","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/619708511077793792\/amTtwRKB_normal.jpg","description":"Microbiologist at Antimicrobial Test Laboratories\n\nInterested in: Bioinformatics, Genetics, Viruses, Vaccines, Antibiotics, Disease, Immunology, DNA, Python","id_on_source":"KelliJoKuntzman","tweeter_id":"798491287","geo":{"lt":"30.5228536","ln":"-97.6776066131535","country":"US"},"followers":819},"tweet_id":"663831502556282880"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/westr\/statuses\/663831497233797125","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4707682],"posted_on":"2015-11-09T21:32:16+00:00","author":{"name":"Robert West PhD","url":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/profile\/preview?locale=en_US&trk=prof-0-sb-preview-primary-button","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/500040415697833989\/p8hvJ9_i_normal.jpeg","description":"Personalized Medicine evangelist #PM101.
