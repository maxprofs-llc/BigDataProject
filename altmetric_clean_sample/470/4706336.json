MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression but their specific roles in bovine mammary gland lipogenesis are unclear. The objective of this study was to determine the expression pattern of miRNAs following mammary gland adaptation to dietary supplementation with 5\u00a0% linseed or safflower oil using next generation RNA-sequencing.\nTwenty-four Canadian Holstein dairy cows (twelve per treatment) in mid lactation were fed a control diet (total mixed ration of corn:grass silages) for 28\u00a0days followed by a treatment period (control diet supplemented with 5\u00a0% linseed or safflower oil) of 28\u00a0days. Milk samples were collected weekly for fat and individual fatty acid determination. RNA from mammary gland biopsies harvested on day-14 (control period) and on days +7 and +28 (treatment period) from six randomly selected cows per treatment was subjected to small RNA sequencing.\nMilk fat percentage decreased significantly (P\u2009<\u20090.001) during treatment with the two diets as compared to the control period. The individual saturated fatty acids C4:0, C6:0, C8:0, C14:0 and C16:0 decreased significantly (P\u2009<\u20090.05) while five USFAs (C14:1, C18:1n11t, C20:3n3, C20:5n3 and CLA:t10c12) increased remarkably (P\u2009<\u20090.05) in response to both treatments. Analysis of 361 million sequence reads generated 321 known bovine miRNAs and 176 novel miRNAs. The expression of fourteen and twenty-two miRNAs was affected (P\u2009<\u20090.05) by linseed and safflower oil treatments, respectively. Seven miRNAs including six up-regulated (bta-miR-199c, miR-199a-3p, miR-98, miR-378, miR-148b and miR-21-5p) and one down-regulated (bta-miR-200a) were found to be regulated (P\u2009<\u20090.05) by both treatments, and thus considered core differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs. The gene targets of core DE miRNAs have functions related to gene expression and general cellular metabolism (P\u2009<\u20090.05) and are enriched in four pathways of lipid metabolism (3-phosphoinositide biosynthesis, 3-phosphoinositide degradation, D-myo-inisitol-5-phosphate metabolism and the superpathway of inositol phosphate compounds).\nOur results suggest that DE miRNAs in this study might be important regulators of bovine mammary lipogenesis and metabolism. The novel miRNAs identified in this study will further enrich the bovine miRNome repertoire and contribute to understanding mammary gland biology.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b9","authors":["Ran Li","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Beaudoin","Adolf A Ammah","Nathalie Bissonnette","Chaouki Benchaar","Xin Zhao","Chuzhao Lei","Eveline M Ibeagha-Awemu"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12864-015-1965-7","first_seen_on":"2015-10-30T15:23:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-2164"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1446476881,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/16\/884?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/16\/884?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26519053?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/16\/884"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/s12864-015-1965-7.pdf","pmid":"26519053","pubdate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Animal Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microarrays","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Genetics & Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Proteomics","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"884","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Deep sequencing shows microRNA involvement in bovine mammary gland adaptation to diets supplemented with linseed oil or safflower oil","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/deep-sequencing-shows-microrna-involvement-bovine-mammary-gland-adaptation-diets-supplemented-linsee"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6520864,"mean":6.0390053006769,"rank":2593106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":3862596,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6520864,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207354,"mean":10.292841434655,"rank":87702,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":115966,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207354,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5128,"mean":3.9151336063975,"rank":2528,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2439,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5128,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":391,"mean":3.9863538461538,"rank":213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":154,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":391,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
