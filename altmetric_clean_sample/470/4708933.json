Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval was obtained, and the requirement for informed consent was waived for this retrospective study. In 129 patients with pathologically proved pancreatic IPMNs, three reviewers independently evaluated their preoperative CT and MR imaging with MRCP findings. Intermodality agreement between multidetector CT and MR imaging with MRCP, as well as interobserver agreement of each imaging modality, for depicting high-risk stigmata and worrisome features were assessed. Diagnostic values of other signs of overt malignancy, including the presence of a parenchymal mass and local-regional extension, were analyzed. Diagnostic performance and intermodality agreement were assessed by using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis and weighted \u03ba statistics. Results Overall, multidetector CT and MR imaging with MRCP were similar in their ability to depict signs suspicious or indicative of malignancy in patients with IPMN (area under the ROC curve [AUC] = 0.82 for both), with good intermodality agreement (\u03ba = 0.75) and moderate interobserver agreement (\u03ba = 0.47-0.59) when high-grade dysplasia was used as the cutoff for malignancy. When parenchymal masses and local-regional extensions were also considered as overt signs of malignancy, the ability to identify invasive IPMNs significantly increased (AUC = 0.87 for CT and AUC = 0.88 for MR imaging), with high sensitivity (94.3%), while maintaining specificity (69.1%). Conclusion The diagnostic performance of multidetector CT and MR imaging with MRCP for identifying the malignant potential of pancreatic IPMNs was similar and showed good intermodality agreement, suggesting that follow-up with either modality may be used.
