However, T lymphocytes have also been shown to be important in a protective immune state. In order to investigate the contribution of both humoral and cellular immune responses in DENV immunity, we used an experimental model in which a non-lethal DENV2 strain (ACS46) is used to intracranially prime Balb\/C mice which develop protective immunity against a lethal DENV2 strain (JHA1). Primed mice generated envelope-specific antibodies and CD8(+) T cell responses targeting mainly non-structural proteins. Immune sera from protected mice did not confer passive protection to na\u00efve mice challenged with the JHA1 strain. In contrast, depletion of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes significantly reduced survival of ACS46-primed mice challenged with the JHA1 strain. Collectively, results presented in this study show that a cellular immune response targeting non-structural proteins are a promising way in vaccine development against dengue.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f610003769","authors":["Amorim, Jaime Henrique","Dos Santos Alves, R\u00fabens Prince","Bizerra, Ra\u00edza","Ara\u00fajo Pereira, Sara","Ramos Pereira, Lennon","Nascimento Fabris, Denicar Lina","Santos, Robert Andreata","Romano, Camila Malta","de Souza Ferreira, Lu\u00eds Carlos"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.virol.2015.10.006","first_seen_on":"2015-10-29T15:32:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1096-0341","00426822"],"journal":"Virology","last_mentioned_on":1461665408,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S004268221500433X","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26496698?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26496698","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Antibodies are not required to a protective immune response against dengue virus elicited in a mouse encephalitis model ","type":"article","volume":"487","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antibodies-not-required-protective-immune-response-against-dengue-virus-elicited-mouse-encephalitis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7607694,"mean":6.5509374902442,"rank":3481976,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":3954199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7607694,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239768,"mean":9.5939422939771,"rank":102716,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":128374,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239768,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2217,"mean":3.6490884476534,"rank":1345,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":832,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2217,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65,"mean":5.25765625,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
