We previously qualified lipids R1 as a marker of oxygen level on experimental tumor models. The objectives of the present study were to assess the applicability of measuring lipids R1 in primary Central Nervous System malignancies in a clinical setting as well as to compare lipids R1 with global (water+lipids) R1 and R2* which are also sensitive to the oxygen environment. 25 patients with brain neuroepithelial tumors were examined on a clinical 3T MR system. Values obtained within regions of interest contouring contrast-enhanced tumor (C+), unenhanced tumor (C-), peritumoral edema, and normal appearing white matter (NAWM) were compared to those obtained for the normal brain parenchyma of 17 healthy volunteers. Global R1 and lipids R1 values were significantly lower in tumors than in NAWM of patients or healthy brain of normal volunteers. In contrast, R2* values were not significantly different in tumors compared to NAWM or healthy brains. None of them showed significant difference between C+ and C- tumor. Global R1 values within NAWM were significantly different from that of both tumor and peritumoral edema, but lacked sensitivity to differentiate between tumor and peritumoral edema. In turn, lipids R1 measurements enabled discrimination between tumor areas and peritumoral edema. In conclusion, global R1 and lipids R1 deserve further attention as potential markers of tumor hypoxia in primary brain tumors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ff3cf058f61000303d","authors":["Safronova, Marta M","Colliez, Florence","Magat, Julie","Joudiou, Nicolas","Jordan, B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte F","Raftopoulos, Christian","Gallez, Bernard","Duprez, Thierry"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.mri.2015.10.021","first_seen_on":"2015-10-31T11:11:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0730725X","1873-5894"],"journal":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (0730725X)","last_mentioned_on":1446560614,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0730725X15002581&_version=1&md5=3311555ae3453237f976a589e9958736","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26523659?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26523659","pubdate":"2015-11-03T14:57:25+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Mapping of global R1 and R2* values versus lipids R1 values as potential markers of hypoxia in human glial tumors: a feasibility study.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mapping-global-r1-r2-values-versus-lipids-r1-values-potential-markers-hypoxia-human-glial-tumors-fea"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6526504,"mean":6.0446498766627,"rank":2894064,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3457616,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6526504,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208428,"mean":10.249639461298,"rank":102152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":97496,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208428,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":398,"mean":2.185758186398,"rank":126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":258,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":398,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":1.2445945945946,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
