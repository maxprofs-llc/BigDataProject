The aim of our study was to investigate prospectively the association between ADAMTS13 activity and ischemic stroke. We included 5941 individuals \u2265 55 years without a history of stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) of the Rotterdam Study, a population-based cohort study. ADAMTS13 activity was measured at inclusion with the FRETS-VWF73 assay and VWF antigen (VWF:Ag) levels by ELISA. We assessed the association between ADAMTS13 activity, VWF:Ag levels and ischemic stroke by Cox proportional hazard analysis. The added value of ADAMTS13 activity above the traditional risk factors for ischemic stroke risk prediction was examined by the c-statistic and the net reclassification improvement index (NRI). All individuals were followed for incident stroke or TIA. Over a median follow-up time of 10.7 years (56403 total person years), 461 participants experienced a stroke, 306 of which ischemic. After adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, individuals with ADAMTS13 activity in the lowest quartile had a higher risk of ischemic stroke (absolute risk 7.3%) than those in the reference highest quartile (absolute risk 3.8%; HR 1.65, 95% CI 1.16-2.32). Adding ADAMTS13 to the model in prediction of ischemic stroke, increased the c-statistic by 0.013 (P=0.003) and provided 0.058 (95% CI -0.002-0.119) NRI. Low ADAMTS13 activity is associated with the risk of ischemic stroke and improves the accuracy of risk predictions for ischemic stroke beyond traditional risk factors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cba","authors":["Michelle A.H.
