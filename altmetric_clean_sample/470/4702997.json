Here we employ a novel aluminum-based molecular additive, Al(I) tetrameric cluster [AlBrNEt3]4, to a hydrocarbon fuel and evaluate the resultant single-droplet combustion properties. This Al4 cluster offers a soluble alternative to nanoscale particulate additives that have recently been explored and may mitigate the observed problems of particle aggregation. Results show the [AlBrNEt3]4 additive to increase the burn rate constant of a toluene-diethyl ether fuel mixture by ~20% in a room temperature oxygen environment with only 39mM of active aluminum additive (0.16 wt % limited by additive solubility). In comparison, a roughly similar addition of nanoaluminum particulate shows no discernable difference in burn properties of the hydrocarbon fuel. High speed video shows the [AlBrNEt3]4 to induce microexplosive gas release events during the last ~30% of the droplet combustion time. We attribute this to HBr gas release based on results of TPR experiments of the [AlBrNEt3]4 dosed with O2 and D2O. A possible mechanism of burn rate enhancement is presented that is consistent with microexplosion observations and TPR results.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec4","authors":["Philip M.
