My sample was restricted to unmarried individuals aged 24 to 28 years and to a period of time before the ACA's individual mandate (2011-2013). I ran models separately for men and women to determine if there were differences based on gender.\nAging out of this provision increased employment among men, employer-sponsored health insurance offers for women, and reports of health insurance coverage being rated as worse than it was 1 year previously (overall and for young women). Uninsured rates did not increase at 26 years, but there was an increase in the purchase of non-group health coverage, indicating interest in remaining insured after age 26 years.\nMany young adults will turn to state and federal health insurance marketplaces for information about health coverage. Because young adults (aged 18-29 years) regularly use social media sites, these sites could be used to advertise insurance to individuals reaching their 26th birthdays. (Am J Public Health.
