Baseline, procedural, and outcome parameters were recorded following Society of Interventional Radiology guidelines. Primary outcome measures included early (<30 days) and delayed (>30 days) re-bleeding events and adverse procedure related complication. Average follow up time was 996 days (median 232 days, range 30-3663 days).\nOne or multiple sites of bleeding were identified in 40 cases. Coil embolization was performed in 39 patients, 26 (66.7%, 26\/39) of which were treated successfully without technical\/clinical failure (n = 12) or loss to follow up (n = 1). Three patients (11.5%, 3\/26) re-bled in the early period within 30 days; one patient went on to hemicolectomy. Four patients (4\/26, 15.3%) experienced delayed re-bleeding after 30 days; two of these also underwent hemicolectomy. No major complication occurred. One minor complication of short segment arterial dissection was seen in the clinical failure group. One case of asymptomatic ischemia was identified on a patient undergoing pre-operative colonoscopy for elective bowel resection. No instances of ischemic stricture were seen. All-cause mortality of successfully treated and all patients at one year was 31% (8\/26) and 30% (12\/40) respectively.\nTranscatheter coil embolization is a durable treatment option with a technical and clinical success rate of 67% in the setting of acute colonic hemorrhage. A modest level of re-bleeding was seen among successfully treated patients in both the early and delayed periods; in the majority of patients, embolization proved to be definitive therapy. Advances in Knowledge: Transcatheter coil embolization is a durable and potentially definitive therapy in the management of acute colonic hemorrhage.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002453","authors":["Ahmed, Osman","Jilani, Danial","Sheth, Sujay","Giger, Maryellen","Funaki, Brian"],"doi":"10.1259\/bjr.20150203","first_seen_on":"2015-10-29T10:23:22+00:00","issns":["1748-880X"],"journal":"British Journal of Radiology","last_mentioned_on":1446114184,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25927678?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25927678","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["radiology"],"title":"Long-term results of microcoil embolization for colonic hemorrhage: How common is rebleeding?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/longterm-results-microcoil-embolization-colonic-haemorrhage-common-rebleeding"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6504996,"mean":6.0272765079752,"rank":5548542,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6504996,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":206856,"mean":10.273136999347,"rank":164650,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":206856,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":596,"mean":2.2445210084034,"rank":445,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":596,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":0.75869565217391,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
