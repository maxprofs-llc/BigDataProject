Intrathecal IgG synthesis, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) oligoclonal bands and lesional IgG deposition suggest a role for antibody-mediated pathology. We examined the binding of IgG1 monoclonal recombinant antibodies (rAbs) derived from MS patient CSF expanded B cell clones to central nervous system (CNS) tissue. MS rAbs displaying CNS binding to mouse and human CNS tissue were further tested for their ability to induce complement-mediated tissue injury in ex vivo spinal cord explant cultures. The staining of CNS tissue, primary human astrocytes and human neurons revealed a measurable bias in MS rAb binding to antigens preferentially expressed on astrocytes and neurons. MS rAbs that recognize myelin-enriched antigens were rarely detected. Both myelin-specific and some astrocyte\/neuronal-specific MS rAbs caused significant myelin loss and astrocyte activation when applied to spinal cord explant cultures in the presence of complement. Overall, the intrathecal B cell response in multiple sclerosis binds to both glial and neuronal targets and produces demyelination in spinal cord explant cultures implicating intrathecal IgG in MS pathogenesis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002159","authors":["Blauth, Kevin","Soltys, John","Matschulat, Adeline","Reiter, Cory R","Ritchie, Alanna","Baird, Nicholas L","Bennett, Jeffrey L","Owens, Gregory P"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00401-015-1500-6","endpage":"781","first_seen_on":"2015-10-30T10:47:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-0533","0001-6322"],"issue":"6","journal":"Acta Neuropathologica","last_mentioned_on":1472151909,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26511623?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26511623","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26511623?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26511623","pubdate":"2015-10-30T22:00:53+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pathology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"765","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Antibodies produced by clonally expanded plasma cells in multiple sclerosis cerebrospinal fluid cause demyelination of spinal cord explants.","type":"article","volume":"130","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antibodies-produced-clonally-expanded-plasma-cells-multiple-sclerosis-cerebrospinal-fluid-cause-demy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.054,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.054},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8276988,"mean":6.9824426364262,"rank":950679,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7326419,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8276988,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243417,"mean":9.8353186150458,"rank":38606,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":204801,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243417,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":923,"mean":11.006347071584,"rank":259,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":663,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":923,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":37.8265,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
