This deficiency poses a challenge to current pharmacological approaches for HIV-1 eradication. The results of this study indicated that gnidimacrin (GM) was able to markedly reduce the latent HIV-1 DNA level and the frequency of latently infected cells in an ex vivo model using patients peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). GM induced approximately 10-fold more HIV-1 production than the HDACI SAHA or romidepsin, which may be responsible for the effectiveness of GM in reducing latent HIV-1 levels. GM achieved these effects at low picomolar concentrations by selective activation of protein kinase C beta I and beta II. Notably, GM was able to reduce the frequency of HIV-1 latently infected cells at concentrations without global T cell activation or stimulating inflammatory cytokine production. GM merits further development as a clinical trial candidate for latent HIV-1 eradication.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e47","authors":["Weihong Lai","Lai, Weihong","Huang, Li","Zhu, Lei","Ferrari, Guido","Chan, Cliburn","Li, Wei","Lee, Kuo-Hsiung","Chen, Chin-Ho","Li Huang","Lei Zhu","Guido Ferrari","Cliburn Chan","Wei Li","Kuo-Hsiung Lee","Chin-Ho Chen"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jmedchem.5b01233","endpage":"8646","first_seen_on":"2015-10-29T14:02:27+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid"],"issns":["1520-4804","0022-2623"],"issue":"21","journal":"Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1446152002,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jmedchem.5b01233"],"pmid":"26509731","pubdate":"2015-10-29T22:00:17+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"8638","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Gnidimacrin, a Potent Anti-HIV Diterpene, Can Eliminate Latent HIV-1 Ex Vivo by Activation of PKC Beta","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/10.1021\/acs.jmedchem.5b01233","volume":"58","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gnidimacrin-potent-antihiv-diterpene-eliminate-latent-hiv1-ex-vivo-activation-protein-kinase-c%CE%B2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6504996,"mean":6.0272765079752,"rank":3080361,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1944391,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6504996,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":206856,"mean":10.273179541224,"rank":110829,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":75044,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":206856,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3480,"mean":3.9621759126186,"rank":2281,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":656,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3480,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":6.8848666666667,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
