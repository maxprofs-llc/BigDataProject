Experiments were performed to determine if BRV acted similarly to LEV to induce or augment short-term depression (STD) under high-frequency neuronal stimulation and slow synaptic vesicle recycling.\nElectrophysiologic field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) recordings were made from CA1 synapses in rat hippocampal slices loaded with BRV or LEV during intrinsic activity or with BRV actively loaded during hypertonic stimulation. STD was examined in response to 5 or 40 Hz stimulus trains. Presynaptic release of FM1-43 was visualized using two-photon microscopy to assess drug effects upon synaptic vesicle mobilization.\nWhen hippocampal slices were incubated in 0.1-30 \u03bcm BRV or 30 \u03bcm-1 mm LEV for 3 h, the relative CA1 field EPSPs decreased over the course of a high-frequency train of stimuli more than for control slices. This STD was frequency- and concentration-dependent, with BRV being 100-fold more potent than LEV. The extent of STD depended on the length of the incubation time for both drugs. Pretreatment with LEV occluded the effects of BRV. Repeated hypertonic sucrose treatments and train stimulation successfully unloaded BRV from recycling vesicles and reversed BRVs effects on STD, as previously reported for LEV. At their maximal concentrations, BRV slowed FM1-43 release to a greater extent than in slices loaded with LEV during prolonged stimulation.\nBRV, similar to LEV, entered into recycling synaptic vesicles and produced a frequency-dependent decrement of synaptic transmission at 100-fold lower concentrations than LEV. In addition, BRV slowed synaptic vesicle mobilization more effectively than LEV, suggesting that these drugs may modify multiple functions of the synaptic vesicle protein SV2A to curb synaptic transmission and limit epileptic activity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027f4","authors":["Yang, Xiaofeng","Bognar, Joseph","He, Tianyu","Mohammed, Mouhari","Niespodziany, Isabelle","Wolff, Christian","Esguerra, Manuel","Rothman, Steven M.","Dubinsky, Janet M.","Rothman, Steven M","Dubinsky, Janet M"],"doi":"10.1111\/epi.13223","endpage":"1909","first_seen_on":"2015-10-30T15:59:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1528-1167"],"issue":"12","journal":"Epilepsia (Series 4)","last_mentioned_on":1450201606,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/epi.13223\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26515103?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/epi.13223"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/epi.13223\/pdf","pmid":"26515103","pubdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"1899","subjects":["brain","neurology"],"title":"Brivaracetam augments short\u2010term depression and slows vesicle recycling","type":"article","volume":"56","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/brivaracetam-augments-shortterm-depression-slows-vesicle-recycling"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6771968,"mean":6.1646290473641,"rank":2483369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4244250,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6771968,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235447,"mean":9.4537841883065,"rank":80684,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":152170,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235447,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2111,"mean":4.7830028436019,"rank":1088,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":999,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2111,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":6.5835820895522,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":5,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Neuroscience":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4,"Unspecified":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1},"mendeley":{"US":1,"MX":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/EpilepsiaJourn\/statuses\/660122305717075968","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4706434],"posted_on":"2015-10-30T15:53:16+00:00","author":{"name":"Epilepsia","url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/journal\/10.1111\/(ISSN)1528-1167","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/483708461457211392\/zg9_amz1_normal.jpeg","description":"Epilepsia is the world's leading journal of original scientific research and commentary in epileptology.
