To examine the effects of this gene flow, the growth of F1 hybrids that were formed by pollinating wild soybean (Glycine soja) with glyphosate-tolerant GM soybean (G. max) or its non-GM counterpart was examined in a greenhouse. The wild soybean was collected from two geographical populations in China. The performance of the wild soybean and the F2 hybrids was further explored in a field trial. The performance was measured by several vegetative and reproductive growth parameters, including the vegetative growth period, pod number, seed number, aboveground biomass, and hundred-seed weight. The pod setting percentage was very low in the hybrid plants. GM hybrid F1 plants had a significantly longer period of vegetative growth, higher biomass, and lower hundred-seed weight than did the non-GM ones. The hundred-seed weight of both F1 and F2 hybrids was significantly higher than that of wild soybean in both the greenhouse and the field trial. No difference in plant growth was found between GM and non-GM F2 hybrids in the field trial. The herbicide-resistant gene appeared not to adversely affect the growth of introgressed wild soybeans, suggesting that the escaped transgene could persist in nature in the absence of herbicide use.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a7b","authors":["Guan, Zheng-Jun","Zhang, Peng-Fei","Wei, Wei","Mi, Xiang-Cheng","Kang, Ding-Ming","Liu, Biao"],"doi":"10.1093\/aobpla\/plv121","first_seen_on":"2015-10-29T10:19:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-2851"],"journal":"AoB Plants","last_mentioned_on":1447107326,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26507568?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/aobpla.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/10\/26\/aobpla.plv121.abstract"],"pmid":"26507568","pubdate":"2015-10-27T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Performance of hybrid progeny formed between genetically modified herbicide-tolerant soybean and its wild ancestor","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/performance-hybrid-progeny-formed-between-genetically-modified-herbicidetolerant-soybean-wild-ancest"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6549866,"mean":6.0697548813592,"rank":3109521,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1955906,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6549866,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207957,"mean":10.294246927235,"rank":112070,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":74940,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207957,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":335,"mean":5.9216766467066,"rank":232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":85,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":335,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":5.8106,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
