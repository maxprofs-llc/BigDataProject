Newborns with HT1 are usually clinically asymptomatic but show liver dysfunction with coagulation abnormalities (prolonged prothrombin time and\/or high international normalised ratio). Early treatment with nitisinone (NTBC) plus dietary restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine prevents the complications of severe liver disease and neurological crises.\nSix newborns referred for hypersuccinylacetonaemia but who had normal coagulation testing on initial evaluation had sequence variants in the GSTZ1 gene, encoding maleylacetoacetate isomerase (MAAI), the enzyme preceding FAH in tyrosine degradation. Initial plasma SA levels ranged from 233 to 1282\u2005nmol\/L, greater than normal (<24\u2005nmol\/L) but less than the initial values of patients with HT1 (16\u2005944-74\u2005377\u2005nmol\/L, n=15). Four individuals were homozygous for c.449C>T (p.Ala150Val). One was compound heterozygous for c.259C>T (p.Arg87Ter) and an intronic sequence variant. In one, a single heterozygous GSTZ1 sequence variant was identified, c.295G>A (p.Val99Met). Bacterial expression of p.Ala150Val and p.Val99Met revealed low MAAI activity. The six individuals with mild hypersuccinylacetonaemia (MHSA) were not treated with diet or nitisinone. Their clinical course has been normal for up to 13\u2005years.\nMHSA can be caused by sequence variants in GSTZ1. Such individuals have thus far remained asymptomatic despite receiving no specific treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6013cf058f6100062d0","authors":["Hao Yang","Walla Al-Hertani","Denis Cyr","Rachel Laframboise","Guy Parizeault","Shu Pei Wang","Francis Rossignol","Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Berthier","Yves Gigu\u00e8re","Paula J Waters","Grant A Mitchell","the Qu\u00e9bec NTBC Study Group","Fernando Alvarez","Catherine Brunel-Guitton","Daniela Buhas","Jos\u00e9e Dubois","Martyne Gosselin","Ugur Halac","Bruno Maranda","John Mitchell","Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Turcotte","Tommy Gagnon","Daniel MacArthur"],"doi":"10.1136\/jmedgenet-2016-104289","first_seen_on":"2016-11-23T02:14:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1468-6244"],"journal":"Journal of Medical Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1480257312,"links":["http:\/\/jmg.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/11\/22\/jmedgenet-2016-104289","http:\/\/jmg.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/11\/22\/jmedgenet-2016-104289?papetoc"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jmg.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/11\/22\/jmedgenet-2016-104289.full.pdf","pmid":"27876694","pubdate":"2016-11-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"jmedgenet-2016-104289","subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Hypersuccinylacetonaemia and normal liver function in maleylacetoacetate isomerase deficiency","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.774,"score_history":{"1y":7.774,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.774},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7811999,"mean":6.6309711159621,"rank":1013193,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":6798945,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7811999,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249567,"mean":12.145882916743,"rank":47801,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":201763,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249567,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1532,"mean":5.3780222077074,"rank":300,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":1207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1532,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":9.6824375,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Hypersuccinylacetonemia and normal liver function in maleylacetoacetate isomerase deficiency","url":"http:\/\/blogs.bmj.com\/jmg\/2016\/11\/22\/hypersuccinylacetonemia-and-normal-liver-function-in-maleylacetoacetate-isomerase-deficiency\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[13905347],"posted_on":"2016-11-22T19:58:00+00:00","summary":"Tyrosinemia is a genetic disease that causes liver failure, cirrhosis and liver cancer.
