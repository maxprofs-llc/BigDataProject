RNA-guided Cas9 nucleases produced from clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas systems have noticeably altered the means to modify the genomes of distinct organisms. They can be notably used to facilitate effective genome manipulation in eukaryotic cells by clearly detailing a 20-nt targeting sequence inside its directed RNA. We discuss the most recent advancements in the molecular basis of the type II CRISPR\/Cas system and encapsulate applications and elements affecting its use in human cells. We also propose possible applications covering its uses ranging from basic science to implementation in the clinic.","authors":["Xuelian Wang","Xiumin Huang","Xiuli Fang","Youzhong Zhang","Wanpeng Wang"],"doi":"10.1038\/mtna.2016.95","first_seen_on":"2016-11-23T04:10:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["false"],"issue":"11","journal":"Molecular Therapy \u2014 Nucleic Acids","last_mentioned_on":1480213226,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/mtna\/journal\/v5\/n11\/full\/mtna201695a.html"],"pmid":"27845770","pubdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","startpage":"e388","title":"CRISPR-Cas9 System as a Versatile Tool for Genome Engineering in Human Cells","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/crisprcas9-system-versatile-tool-genome-engineering-human-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.6,"score_history":{"1y":8.6,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.6},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
