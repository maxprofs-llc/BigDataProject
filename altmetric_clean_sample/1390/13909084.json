Previous in vivo results have been conflicting, indicating that maximal ROM may or may not increase superior and\/or inferior to the arthrodesis. There are no previous reports of midrange motion in arthrodesis patients and similar-aged controls.\nEight single-level (C5\/C6) anterior arthrodesis patients (tested 7\u200a\u00b1\u200a1 months and 28\u200a\u00b1\u200a6 months postsurgery) and six asymptomatic control subjects (tested twice, 58\u200a\u00b1\u200a6 months apart) performed dynamic full ROM flexion\/extension and axial rotation whereas biplane radiographs were collected at 30\u200aimages per second. A previously validated tracking process determined three-dimensional vertebral position from each pair of radiographs with submillimeter accuracy. The intervertebral maximal ROM and midrange motion in flexion\/extension, rotation, lateral bending, and anterior-posterior translation were compared between test dates and between groups.\nAdjacent segment maximal ROM did not increase over time during flexion\/extension, or rotation movements. Adjacent segment maximal rotational ROM was not significantly greater in arthrodesis patients than in corresponding motion segments of similar-aged controls. C4\/C5 adjacent segment rotation during the midrange of head motion and maximal anterior-posterior translation were significantly greater in arthrodesis patients than in the corresponding motion segment in controls on the second test date.\nC5\/C6 arthrodesis appears to significantly affect midrange, but not end-range, adjacent segment motions. The effects of arthrodesis on adjacent segment motion may be best evaluated by longitudinal studies that compare maximal and midrange adjacent segment motion to corresponding motion segments of similar-aged controls to determine if the adjacent segment motion is truly excessive.\n3.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100035a7","authors":["Anderst, William J.","West, Tyler","Donaldson, William F.
