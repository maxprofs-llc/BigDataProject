For stoma cloths, a humidifying capacity of 13.7 mg\/L was found to decrease to 8.5 mg\/L if air-leaks around the cloth occurred. Patients who used HMEs disliked stoma cloths because they interfered with voicing, they became soiled more easily, and were less effective at reducing coughing and mucus production.\nAlthough less acceptable to patients who use an HME, stoma cloths do provide significant humidifying capacity and should be encouraged when HMEs are unavailable or inappropriate. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
