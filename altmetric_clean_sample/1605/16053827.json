Patients with DMD are unable to produce dystrophin, a crucial protein found in myocytes, leading to a loss of muscle support and integrity. Corticosteroids are the standard supportive treatment for DMD; however, there is a high demand to expand the number of safe, effective pharmacological options. Recently there has been a surge of new therapeutics for DMD, offering hope to patients. A variety of these new medications, such as stop codon readthrough agents, exon-skipping agents, and utrophin modulators aim to replace dystrophin in myocytes. Other new therapeutics aim to prevent or repair muscle damage caused by the absence of dystrophin. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on the medications being investigated in DMD.
