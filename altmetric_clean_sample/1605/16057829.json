This KCNC1 variant causes a dominant-negative effect. Here we describe three patients from the same family with intellectual disability and dysmorphic features. The three affected individuals carry a c.1015C>T (p.(Arg339*)) nonsense variant in KCNC1 gene. As previously observed in the mutant mouse carrying a disrupted KCNC1 gene, these findings reveal that individuals with a KCNC1 loss-of-function variant can present intellectual disability without seizure and epilepsy.European Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 1 February 2017; doi:10.1038\/ejhg.2017.3.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002836","authors":["Poirier, Karine","Viot, G\u00e9raldine","Lombardi, Laura","Jauny, Cl\u00e9mence","Billuart, Pierre","Bienvenu, Thierry","Karine Poirier","G\u00e9raldine Viot","Laura Lombardi","Cl\u00e9mence Jauny","Pierre Billuart","Thierry Bienvenu"],"doi":"10.1038\/ejhg.2017.3","first_seen_on":"2017-02-02T18:19:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1018-4813","1476-5438"],"journal":"European Journal of Human Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1486536619,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28145425","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ejhg\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/ejhg20173a.html"],"pmid":"28145425","pubdate":"2017-02-02T22:04:29+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Genetics of the nervous system","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Loss of Function of KCNC1 is associated with intellectual disability without seizures","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/loss-function-kcnc1-associated-intellectual-disability-without-seizures"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8177609,"mean":6.9186386481167,"rank":4334464,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2270713,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8177609,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":264717,"mean":12.840141638586,"rank":150810,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":87642,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":264717,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1810,"mean":7.7325516860144,"rank":1391,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":261,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1810,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":10.149490196078,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Neuroscience":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"CH":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IngoHelbig\/statuses\/827219768675549186","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16057829],"posted_on":"2017-02-02T18:18:56+00:00","author":{"name":"Ingo Helbig","url":"http:\/\/channelopathist.net","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/112216407\/Picture_1_normal.png","description":"Child Neurology resident, epilepsy genetics researcher & bioinformatics rookie, neuroblogger wannabe","id_on_source":"IngoHelbig","tweeter_id":"27087967","geo":{"lt":39.95234,"ln":-75.16379,"country":"US"},"followers":461},"tweet_id":"827219768675549186"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/varsome\/statuses\/829219634368876546","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16057829],"posted_on":"2017-02-08T06:45:41+00:00","author":{"name":"varsome","url":"https:\/\/varsome.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/743881675990532096\/8YC4ayzF_normal.jpg","description":"The Human Genomic Variant Search Engine","id_on_source":"varsome","tweeter_id":"730290856490639360","geo":{"lt":46.516,"ln":6.63282,"country":"CH"},"followers":402},"tweet_id":"829219634368876546"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/saphetor\/statuses\/829220800070836225","license":"gnip","rt":["varsome"],"citation_ids":[16057829],"posted_on":"2017-02-08T06:50:19+00:00","author":{"name":"Saphetor","url":"http:\/\/saphetor.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/644195646103142400\/cUIAku_w_normal.png","description":"The Genome Interpreter","id_on_source":"saphetor","tweeter_id":"3676834222","geo":{"lt":46.516,"ln":6.63282,"country":"CH"},"followers":222},"tweet_id":"829220800070836225"}]}}
