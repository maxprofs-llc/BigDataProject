The aim of this study was to compare the long-term and oncologic outcomes of laparoscopic resection and the open approach in clinical T4 colorectal cancer.\nTwo hundred ninety-three consecutive patients undergoing curative surgery for colorectal cancer suspected to be T4 by computed tomography and\/or magnetic resonance imaging were reviewed.\nDespite clinical suspicion of T4 disease in all cases, concordance with pathologic determination of T4 was only 37.9\u00a0%. Of the 71 patients in the laparoscopic group, four (5.6\u00a0%) were converted to the open technique. Patients in the laparoscopic group had significantly lower estimated blood loss (p\u2009<\u20090.001), fewer days to first flatus (p\u2009=\u20090.001), shorter length of hospital stay (p\u2009<\u20090.001), and fewer adverse events (14.1\u00a0% versus 31.5\u00a0%, p\u2009=\u20090.004). After a median follow-up of 36\u00a0months, 5-year disease-free survival was not significantly different between the two groups (81.8\u00a0% in laparoscopic versus 73.9\u00a0% in open surgery, p\u2009=\u20090.433). The clinical factors that predicted T4 staging on pathologic examination were found to be male sex (p\u2009=\u20090.038), preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen status (p\u2009=\u20090.021), clinical N status (p\u2009=\u20090.046), and clinical cancer perforation (p\u2009=\u20090.004).\nLaparoscopic colorectal resection for T4 colorectal cancer has perioperative and long-term oncologic outcomes similar to those of the open approach when performed by an experienced surgeon.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008b0","authors":["Jong Seob Park","Jong Seob Park","Jung Wook Huh","Yoon Ah Park","Yong Beom Cho","Seong Hyeon Yun","Hee Cheol Kim","Woo Yong Lee","Ho-Kyung Chun"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12885-016-2753-8","first_seen_on":"2016-09-05T21:40:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-2407"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1473111630,"links":["http:\/\/bmccancer.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12885-016-2753-8?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmccancer.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12885-016-2753-8?site=bmccancer.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"27595851","pubdate":"2016-09-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"714","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Clinically suspected T4 colorectal cancer may be resected using a laparoscopic approach","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinically-suspected-t4-colorectal-cancer-resected-using-laparoscopic-approach"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8331095,"mean":7.02255168024,"rank":7203183,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8331095,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252316,"mean":12.449343519013,"rank":210873,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252316,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3500,"mean":3.5838925407259,"rank":2808,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3500,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195,"mean":6.662412371134,"rank":136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
