The present paper examines optimal vaccination trajectories before and after an outbreak of a special class of epidemics where the disease normally eradicates itself. The focus is on epidemics where mortality may be ignored, influenza being the prime example. One important insight is that there may be increasing returns to scale in vaccination.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f61000591a","authors":["N\u00e6vdal, Eric"],"doi":"10.1002\/hec.1803","endpage":"1476","first_seen_on":"2011-11-15T10:37:30+00:00","issns":["1099-1050","1057-9230"],"issue":"12","journal":"Health economics (Online)","last_mentioned_on":1320141795,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/hec.1803\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/hec.1803\/pdf","pmid":"22021065","pubdate":"2011-10-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Economics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1456","subjects":["healthservices"],"title":"FIGHTING TRANSIENT EPIDEMICS\u00e2\u0080\u0094OPTIMAL VACCINATION SCHEDULES BEFORE AND AFTER AN OUTBREAK","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fighting-transient-epidemicsoptimal-vaccination-schedules-before-after-outbreak"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6700589,"mean":6.1629637912357,"rank":5723181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6700589,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83235,"mean":4.7029511978278,"rank":68950,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83235,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":960,"mean":7.4830636079249,"rank":918,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":960,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":5.425,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
