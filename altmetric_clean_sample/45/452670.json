Median time spent in such a unit for the others was 8 months (IQR 6). Significantly fewer trainees lacked confidence in managing liver-related conditions if they had spent time training in a specialist liver unit and with increasing years in training. One in three trainees is dissuaded from a career in hepatology. One in five trainees wished to work part time as consultants-an option preferred significantly more by women.\nHepatology training in the UK is perceived by trainees as being suboptimal. A national strategy aimed at improving and standardising hepatology training and making specialist liver unit experience available for every trainee is required.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9103cf058f61000cc68","authors":["Imran Patanwala","Mark Hudson"],"doi":"10.1136\/flgastro-2011-100028","first_seen_on":"2011-11-12T07:32:18+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["2041-4145","2041-4137"],"issue":"1","journal":"Frontline gastroenterology","last_mentioned_on":1323881743,"links":["http:\/\/fg.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2011\/11\/11\/flgastro-2011-100028.long","http:\/\/fg.bmj.com\/cgi\/content\/short\/3\/1\/52?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/fg.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2011\/11\/11\/flgastro-2011-100028.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC5517250","pmid":"28839632","pubdate":"2011-11-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd","title":"Hepatology training in the UK","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hepatology-training-uk"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630565,"mean":4.929464153233,"rank":1807407,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1646193,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630565,"percentile":45},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70650,"mean":3.771773301816,"rank":23119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":43600,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70650,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":2.6229885057471,"rank":57,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/MDLCano\/status\/135249848042651648","citation_ids":[452670],"posted_on":"2011-11-12T06:57:31+00:00","author":{"id_on_source":"MDLCano","tweeter_id":330092556},"tweet_id":"135249848042651648"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Hepatology training in the UK","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=331426293536141&id=170636979615074","citation_ids":[452670],"posted_on":"2011-12-14T16:55:43+00:00","summary":"Objectives\nTo establish the perceived adequacy of the hepatology training component of the unified gastroenterology and hepatology training programme in the UK by assessing the attitudes and experiences of trainees in the programme.\n\nDesign and interventio","author":{"name":"Frontline Gastroenterology","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/170636979615074","facebook_wall_name":"Frontline Gastroenterology","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/170636979615074\/picture","id_on_source":"170636979615074"}}]}}
