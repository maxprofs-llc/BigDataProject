Based on a recent finding of a sexual dimorphism in facial metrics that is independent of body size, we conducted three studies to examine the extent to which individual differences in the facial width-to-height ratio were associated with trait dominance (using a questionnaire) and aggression during a behavioural task and in a naturalistic setting (varsity and professional ice hockey). In study 1, men had a larger facial width-to-height ratio, higher scores of trait dominance, and were more reactively aggressive compared with women. Individual differences in the facial width-to-height ratio predicted reactive aggression in men, but not in women (predicted 15% of variance). In studies 2 (male varsity hockey players) and 3 (male professional hockey players), individual differences in the facial width-to-height ratio were positively related to aggressive behaviour as measured by the number of penalty minutes per game obtained over a season (predicted 29 and 9% of the variance, respectively). Together, these findings suggest that the sexually dimorphic facial width-to-height ratio may be an 'honest signal' of propensity for aggressive behaviour.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a3","authors":["Carr\u00e9 JM","McCormick CM","Justin M Carr\u00e9","Cheryl M McCormick"],"doi":"10.1098\/rspb.2008.0873","endpage":"2656","first_seen_on":"2011-11-15T00:59:19+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1471-2954","0962-8452"],"issue":"1651","journal":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1505240747,"links":["http:\/\/rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org\/content\/275\/1651\/2651","http:\/\/rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org\/content\/275\/1651\/2651.short","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18713717","http:\/\/m.rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org\/\/content\/275\/1651\/2651","http:\/\/rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org\/content\/275\/1651\/2651.full.pdf html","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1098\/rspb.2008.0873","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2570531","http:\/\/m.rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org\/content\/275\/1651\/2651.full","http:\/\/www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov\/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2570531"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org\/content\/275\/1651\/2651.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC2570531","pmid":"18713717","pubdate":"2008-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Environmental Science","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Medicine","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"2651","subjects":["biology"],"title":"In your face: facial metrics predict aggressive behaviour in the laboratory and in varsity and professional hockey players.","type":"article","volume":"275","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/face-facial-metrics-predict-aggressive-behaviour-laboratory-varsity-professional-hockey-players"},"altmetric_score":{"score":89.116,"score_history":{"1y":17,"6m":17,"3m":17,"1m":17,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":89.116},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8453528,"mean":7.1048177973448,"rank":101012,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":8352584,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8453528,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89978,"mean":5.2099655689787,"rank":627,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":89351,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89978,"percentile":99},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6051,"mean":23.742418181818,"rank":352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":5699,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6051,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":16.649611111111,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":26,"Researcher":41,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Student  > Ph.
