However, mechanisms for coordinating actions of multiple co-regulator proteins are poorly understood. We demonstrate that multiple protein-protein interactions by the protein acetyltransferase TIP60 are required for estrogen-induced transcription of a subset of estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1) target genes in human cells. Estrogen-induced recruitment of TIP60 requires direct binding of TIP60 to ER\u03b1 and the action of chromatin-remodeling ATPase BRG1, leading to increased recruitment of histone methyltransferase MLL1 and increased monomethylation of histone H3 at Lys4. TIP60 recruitment also requires preferential binding of the TIP60 chromodomain to histone H3 containing monomethylated Lys4, which marks active and poised enhancer elements. After recruitment, TIP60 increases acetylation of histone H2A at Lys5. Thus, complex cooperation of TIP60 with ER\u03b1 and other chromatin-remodeling enzymes is required for estrogen-induced transcription.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f61000316f","authors":["Kwang Won Jeong","Kyunghwan Kim","Alan Jialun Situ","Tobias S Ulmer","Woojin An","Michael R Stallcup"],"doi":"10.1038\/nsmb.2153","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2011-11-14T14:32:05+00:00","funders":["nigms","nhlbi"],"issns":["1545-9993","1545-9985"],"journal":"Nature Structural & Molecular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1323279067,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nsmb\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/abs\/nsmb.2153.html?WT.mc_id=TWT_NatureCellBio","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nsmb\/journal\/v18\/n12\/full\/nsmb.2153.html?WT.mc_id=TWT_NatStructMolBio"],"pmid":"22081016","pubdate":"2011-11-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"","subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Recognition of enhancer element\u00e2\u0080\u0093specific histone methylation by TIP60 in transcriptional activation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/recognition-enhancer-elementspecific-histone-methylation-tip60-transcriptional-activation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505992,"mean":5.1115236646191,"rank":1993911,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2420163,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505992,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73733,"mean":4.0169801443064,"rank":23099,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":48757,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73733,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1632,"mean":5.8083065603924,"rank":900,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":685,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1632,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":2.5154782608696,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":22,"Student  > Ph.
