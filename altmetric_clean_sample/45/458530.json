Color affects how they warm their bodies."],"citation":{"abstract":"A cline in the frequency of melanic morphs of the two-spot ladybird, Adalia bipunctata, was first surveyed in 1980 along a transect extending inland from the coast in the Netherlands. At that time, the frequency of melanics increased over some 40 km from 10% near the coast to nearly 60% inland. Additional surveys made in 1991 and 1995 demonstrated some progressive change in cline shape. New samples from 1998 and 2004 confirm these dynamics, and show that over a period of about 50 generations for the beetle, the cline had decayed rapidly to yield rather uniform frequencies of melanic morphs at around 20% along the whole transect by 2004. Climate data and evidence for thermal melanism in this species support our contention that these dynamics reflect a dramatic example of a rapid genetic response within populations to climate change and local selection.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029dd","authors":["Brakefield PM","de Jong PW","P M Brakefield","P W de Jong"],"doi":"10.1038\/hdy.2011.49","endpage":"578","first_seen_on":"2011-11-17T00:09:56+00:00","issns":["1365-2540","0018-067X"],"issue":"6","journal":"Heredity","last_mentioned_on":1323163186,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21792220","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/hdy\/journal\/v107\/n6\/full\/hdy201149a.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/hdy\/journal\/v107\/n6\/full\/hdy201149a.html?WT.ec_id=HDY-201112"],"pmid":"21792220","pubdate":"2011-07-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"574","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"A steep cline in ladybird melanism has decayed over 25 years: a genetic response to climate change?","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/hdy.2011.49","volume":"107","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/steep-cline-ladybird-melanism-decayed-25-years-genetic-response-climate-change"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.368,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.368},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4681522,"mean":5.6990934027662,"rank":416461,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":4265035,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4681522,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229926,"mean":4.4087042557357,"rank":19143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":210782,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229926,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":819,"mean":6.291858190709,"rank":165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":654,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":819,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":10.393666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
