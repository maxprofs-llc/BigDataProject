The coding of such spectra in the brain almost always involves opponency between pairs of systems or structures. There is ample evidence for the role of dopamine in the appetitive half of this spectrum, but little agreement about the existence, nature, or role of putative aversive opponents such as serotonin. In this review, we consider the structure of opponency in terms of previous biases about the nature of the decision problems that animals face, the conflicts that may thus arise between Pavlovian and instrumental responses, and an additional spectrum joining invigoration to inhibition. We use this analysis to shed light on aspects of the role of serotonin and its interactions with dopamine.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031a7","authors":["Y-Lan Boureau","Peter Dayan"],"doi":"10.1038\/npp.2010.151","endpage":"97","first_seen_on":"2011-11-11T17:04:45+00:00","issns":["0893-133X","1470-634X"],"journal":"Neuropsychopharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1339863710,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/npp\/journal\/v36\/n1\/full\/npp2010151a.html"],"pmid":"20881948","pubdate":"2010-09-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"74","subjects":["psychopharmacology","neurology"],"title":"Opponency Revisited: Competition and Cooperation Between Dopamine and Serotonin","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/opponency-revisited-competition-cooperation-between-dopamine-serotonin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":1786443,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2638552,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73847,"mean":4.1740995043739,"rank":20883,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":51361,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73847,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2672,"mean":7.4480524148259,"rank":1368,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":1248,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2672,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":6.0381428571429,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":6,"Professor > Associate Professor":17,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":101,"Student  > Doctoral Student":27,"Student  > Ph.
