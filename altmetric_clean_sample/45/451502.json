The effect of the combination of ASD with ADHD (ASD\/ADHD) was also studied. One hundred and sixty-one adult individuals (\u226518 years of age) were included in the study. None had full scale IQ less than 71. The neuropsychological investigations included measures of intellectual ability, learning and memory, attention\/executive function and theory of mind. The three diagnostic groups showed reduced performance in most cognitive domains. However, within these domains differentiating distinct features could be seen. The dysfunctions of the ASD\/ADHD group cannot be seen as a summary of the dysfunctions found in the ASD and ADHD groups. The ADHD seemed to have the most severe neuropsychological impairments of the three groups. No domain-specific deficit typical of any of the diagnostic groups was found.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003464","authors":["Nyd\u00e9n A","Niklasson L","Stahlberg O","Anckarsater H","Wentz E","Rastam M","Gillberg C"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ridd.2010.04.010","first_seen_on":"2011-11-11T07:38:51+00:00","issns":["1873-3379","0891-4222","08914222"],"issue":"6","journal":"Research in Developmental Disabilities","last_mentioned_on":1352729002,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20537859","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ridd.2010.04.010"],"pmid":"20537859","pubdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Specialist Studies In Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Adults with autism spectrum disorders and ADHD neuropsychological aspects.","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adults-autism-spectrum-disorders-adhd-neuropsychological-aspects"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8163518,"mean":6.8970466082141,"rank":6189995,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1095303,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8163518,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89858,"mean":5.1517486450694,"rank":62240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":14409,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89858,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1421,"mean":3.1650746478873,"rank":928,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":345,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1421,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":4.1692,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":21,"Student  > Ph.
