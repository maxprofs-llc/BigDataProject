Terminal differentiation usually coincides with cell cycle exit and is thought to engage stable transcriptional repression of cell cycle genes. Here, we examine the robustness of the post-mitotic state, using Caenorhabditis elegans muscle cells as a model. We found that expression of a G1 Cyclin and CDK initiates cell cycle re-entry in muscle cells without interfering with the differentiated state. Cyclin D\/CDK4 (CYD-1\/CDK-4) expression was sufficient to induce DNA synthesis in muscle cells, in contrast to Cyclin E\/CDK2 (CYE-1\/CDK-2), which triggered mitotic events. Tissue-specific gene-expression profiling and single molecule FISH experiments revealed that Cyclin D and E kinases activate an extensive and overlapping set of cell cycle genes in muscle, yet failed to induce some key activators of G1\/S progression. Surprisingly, CYD-1\/CDK-4 also induced an additional set of genes primarily associated with growth and metabolism, which were not activated by CYE-1\/CDK-2. Moreover, CYD-1\/CDK-4 expression also down-regulated a large number of genes enriched for catabolic functions. These results highlight distinct functions for the two G1 Cyclin\/CDK complexes and reveal a previously unknown activity of Cyclin D\/CDK-4 in regulating metabolic gene expression. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that many cell cycle genes can still be transcriptionally induced in post-mitotic muscle cells, while maintenance of the post-mitotic state might depend on stable repression of a limited number of critical cell cycle regulators.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000334a","authors":["Jerome Korzelius","Inge The","Suzan Ruijtenberg","Martine B.
