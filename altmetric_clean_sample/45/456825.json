The total number of participants (N) in the assessed studies (k) varied according to whether the original study had used either Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA; N = 19,206, k = 13) or Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA; N = 65,554, k = 16). The factor structures of the CES-D were compared across five racial\/ethnic groups: African Americans, American Indians, Asians, Whites, and Hispanics. Meta-analysis results suggest that the structure of the CES-D observed in EFAs varied substantially between racial\/ethnic groups, whereas the CFA-assessed structure of the CES-D was mostly consistent between racial\/ethnic groups. The meta-analysis of EFA studies did not consistently replicate the original four-factor structure reported by Radloff (1977), but the meta-analysis of CFA studies replicated the original four-factor structure in four of the five racial\/ethnic groups. Overall, the present meta-analysis found strong evidence that the original four-factor structure may not be the best fit for all racial\/ethnic groups. Thus, in clinical settings where the CES-D is used as a tool to screen for depression, clinicians and researchers should recognize the risk that symptoms of depression may be presented differently by members of different racial\/ethnic groups.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ff3cf058f610006171","doi":"10.1037\/a0025434","first_seen_on":"2011-11-16T00:54:11+00:00","issns":["1099-9809 (Print)"],"journal":"Cultural Diversity & Ethnic Minority Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1321403757,"links":["http:\/\/psycnet.apa.org\/journals\/cdp\/17\/4\/381?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+apa-journals-cdp+(Cultural+Diversity+and+Ethnic+Minority+Psychology)"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/psycnet.apa.org\/journals\/cdp\/17\/4\/381.pdf","pmid":"21988578","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Educational Publishing Foundation","scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["socialsciences","psychology"],"title":"Race\/ethnicity and the factor structure of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale: A meta-analysis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/raceethnicity-factor-structure-center-epidemiologic-studies-depression-scale-metaanalysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":3556470,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":831435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68595,"mean":4.610352188238,"rank":43203,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":12190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68595,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":188,"mean":2.7025561497326,"rank":134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":188,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":2.575,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
