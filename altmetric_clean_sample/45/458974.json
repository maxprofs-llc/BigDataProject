Psychiatrists working in mental healthcare organizations may experience demoralization for numerous reasons, including diminished funding for valued programs, personnel reductions, and administrative burdens hindering patient care. Demoralization places psychiatrists and other mental health professionals at increased risk for burnout, and its associated problems related to physical and mental difficulties, poor patient care, and staff losses and turnover. Demoralization, therefore, presents an important challenge to medical and clinical leaders who must address this issue to maintain the organizational commitment to optimal patient-centered care. This can be done using sound and accepted leadership principles coupled with a values orientation. The paper provides an illustration.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e6f","doi":"10.1097\/nmd.0b013e3182349e79","first_seen_on":"2011-11-17T09:16:02+00:00","issns":["0022-3018"],"issue":"11","journal":"Journal of Nervous & Mental Disease","last_mentioned_on":1344666835,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jonmd\/Abstract\/2011\/11000\/Addressing_Demoralization_in_Clinical_Staff__A.13.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jonmd\/2011\/11000\/Addressing_Demoralization_in_Clinical_Staff__A.13.pdf","pmid":"22048143","pubdate":"2011-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"892","subjects":["psychiatry","neurology"],"title":"Addressing Demoralization in Clinical Staff: A True Test of Leadership","type":"article","volume":"199","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/addressing-demoralization-clinical-staff-true-test-leadership"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":2312192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1574635,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229514,"mean":4.1898177271007,"rank":98943,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":96848,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229514,"percentile":42},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1368,"mean":3.1251221653255,"rank":819,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":363,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1368,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":1.622,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
