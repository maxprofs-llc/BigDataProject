In this paper we present a population genetic analysis of X chromosome drive in the stalk-eyed fly, Teleopsis dalmanni, to determine how this natural polymorphism influences genetic diversity. We analyzed patterns of DNA sequence variation at two X-linked regions (comprising 1325 bp) approximately 50 cM apart and one autosomal region (comprising 921 bp) for 50 males, half of which were collected in the field from one of two allopatric locations and the other half were derived from lab-reared individuals with known brood sex ratios. These two populations are recently diverged but exhibit partial postzygotic reproductive isolation, i.e. crosses produce sterile hybrid males and fertile females. We find no nucleotide or microsatellite variation on the drive X chromosome, whereas the same individuals show levels of variation at autosomal regions that are similar to field-collected flies. Furthermore, one field-caught individual collected 10 years previously had a nearly identical X haplotype to the drive X, and is over 2% divergent from other haplotypes sampled from the field. These results are consistent with a selective sweep that has removed genetic variation from much of the drive X chromosome. We discuss how this finding may relate to the rapid evolution of postzygotic reproductive isolation that has been documented for these flies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2011PLoSO...6E7254C","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0027254","first_seen_on":"2011-11-17T17:00:40+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"11","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1321545667,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22087274?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22087274","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Reduced Polymorphism Associated with X Chromosome Meiotic Drive in the Stalk-Eyed Fly Teleopsis dalmanni.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reduced-polymorphism-associated-x-chromosome-meiotic-drive-stalkeyed-fly-teleopsis-dalmanni"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":3108075,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":983628,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229514,"mean":4.1616807413962,"rank":143722,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":52488,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229514,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80034,"mean":8.2711350817788,"rank":55563,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":17289,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80034,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3560,"mean":5.7171694296151,"rank":2205,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":897,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3560,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
