Children prefer to be protected in some situations and to share decision-making in others. Adults in the health care setting need to consider children as individuals, rather than as a homogenous group, and take into account that a child's competence and preferences will depend on the circumstances in every situation. This article argues for a situational perspective of children's participation to act in the child's best interest and to balance protection with shared decision-making, according to children's rights and desires.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a0a","authors":["Coyne I","Harder M","Imelda Coyne","Maria Harder"],"doi":"10.1177\/1367493511406570","endpage":"319","first_seen_on":"2011-11-11T04:30:19+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1741-2889","1367-4935"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Child Health Care","last_mentioned_on":1420581540,"links":["http:\/\/chc.sagepub.com\/cgi\/content\/abstract\/1367493511406570v1","http:\/\/chc.sagepub.com\/content\/15\/4\/312.long"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/chc.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2011\/05\/04\/1367493511406570.full.pdf","pmid":"21828162","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"312","subjects":["nursing","pediatrics"],"title":"Children's participation in decision-making: Balancing protection with shared decision-making using a situational perspective.","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/childrens-participation-decisionmaking-balancing-protection-shared-decisionmaking-using-situational"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.112,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.112},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4702597,"mean":5.4369572291408,"rank":686538,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":4016184,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4702597,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74391,"mean":4.3285323027288,"rank":9825,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":64565,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74391,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191,"mean":2.7898315789474,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":171,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.225,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
