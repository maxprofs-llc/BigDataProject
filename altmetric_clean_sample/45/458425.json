In humans, ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and Broca's area are known to be involved in voluntary phonation. In contrast, no neurophysiological data are available about the role of the oro-facial sector of nonhuman primates PMv in this function. In order to address this issue, we recorded PMv neurons from two monkeys trained to emit coo-calls. Results showed that a population of motor neurons specifically fire during vocalization. About two thirds of them discharged before sound onset, while the remaining were time-locked with it. The response of vocalization-selective neurons was present only during conditioned (voluntary) but not spontaneous (emotional) sound emission. These data suggest that the control of vocal production exerted by PMv neurons constitutes a newly emerging property in the monkey lineage, shedding light on the evolution of phonation-based communication from a nonhuman primate species.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Gino Coud\u00e9","Pier Francesco Ferrari","Francesca Rod\u00e0","Monica Maranesi","Eleonora Borelli","Vania Veroni","Fabio Monti","Stefano Rozzi","Leonardo Fogassi"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0026822","first_seen_on":"2011-11-16T23:08:07+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"11","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1325537343,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0026822?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+plosone%2FNeuroscience+%28PLoS+ONE+Alerts%3A+Neuroscience%29","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22073201","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0026822"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0026822.pdf","pmid":"22073201","pubdate":"2011-11-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e26822","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Neurons Controlling Voluntary Vocalization in the Macaque Ventral Premotor Cortex","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neurons-controlling-voluntary-vocalization-macaque-ventral-premotor-cortex"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":1650412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2824548,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66796,"mean":4.2514084287746,"rank":16977,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":49254,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66796,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80036,"mean":8.2965760979572,"rank":26298,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":52861,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80036,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1972,"mean":6.2824657534247,"rank":590,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":1359,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1972,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
