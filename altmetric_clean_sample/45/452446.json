A pigment, consisting of a redox dye, methylene blue (MB), and a sacrificial electron donor, DL-threitol, coated onto an inorganic support with semiconductor functionality, TiO(2), has been extruded in low-density polyethylene (LDPE). The blue-coloured indicator is readily photobleached in <90 s using UVA light (4 mW cm(-2)), whereby MB is converted to its colourless, leuco form, leuco-methylene blue (LMB). This form persists in the absence of oxygen, but is re-oxidised to MB in ~2.5 days in air under ambient conditions (\u223c21 \u00b0C, ~65% RH) within the O(2) smart plastic film. The rate of recovery is linearly dependent upon the ambient level of O(2). At the lower temperature of 5 \u00b0C, the kinetics of the photobleaching activation step is largely unchanged, whereas that of recovery is markedly reduced to t(1\/2) = 36 h at 5 \u00b0C (cf. 9 h at 21 \u00b0C); the activation energy for the recovery step was calculated as 28 kJ mol(-1). The O(2)-sensitive recovery step was found to be moderately dependent upon humidity at 21 \u00b0C, but not significantly dependent upon humidity at 5 \u00b0C. The possible application of this type of indicator in food packaging is illustrated and discussed briefly.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012Ana...137..106M","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002247","authors":["Andrew Mills","Katherine Lawrie","Julie Bardin","Alistair Apedaile","Graham A.
