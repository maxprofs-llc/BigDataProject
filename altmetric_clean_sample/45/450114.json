Strains of the EAEC pathotype are basically adapted to the human host. To clarify whether in contrast to this paradigm, the O104:H4 outbreak strain and\/or EAEC may also be able to colonize ruminants, we screened a total of 2.000 colonies from faecal samples of 100 cattle from 34 different farms - all located in the HUS outbreak region of Northern Germany - for genes associated with the O104:H4 HUS outbreak strain (stx2, terD, rfbO104, fliCH4), STEC (stx1, stx2, escV), EAEC (pAA, aggR, astA), and ESBL-production (blaCTX-M, blaTEM, blaSHV).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000827","authors":["Lothar H Wieler","Lothar H Wieler","Torsten Semmler","Inga Eichhorn","Esther M Antao","Bianca Kinnemann","Lutz Geue","Helge Karch","Sebastian Guenther","Astrid Bethe"],"doi":"10.1186\/1757-4749-3-17","first_seen_on":"2011-11-10T18:36:18+00:00","issns":["","1757-4749"],"issue":"1","journal":"Gut Pathogens","last_mentioned_on":1320928800,"links":["http:\/\/www.gutpathogens.com\/content\/3\/1\/17\/abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC3227623","pmid":"22051440","pubdate":"2011-11-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"17","title":"No evidence of the Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O104:H4 outbreak strain or enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) found in cattle faeces in northern Germany, the hotspot of the 2011 HUS outbreak area","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evidence-shiga-toxinproducing-e-coli-o104h4-outbreak-strain-enteroaggregative-e-coli-eaec-found-catt"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.024,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.024},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685758,"mean":4.9523304688866,"rank":605025,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":3076682,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685758,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71175,"mean":3.7795222131677,"rank":9667,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":61491,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71175,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100,"mean":6.2576565656566,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":72,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.75,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
