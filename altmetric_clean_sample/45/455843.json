The retrospective autopsy study was performed for a 10-year period, and it included selected cases of single suicidal gunshot head injury, committed by handguns. We considered only contact or near-contact wounds. The sample included 479 deceased, with average age 47.1 \u00b1 19.1 years (range, 12-89 years): 432 males and 47 females, with 317 right-handed, 25 left-handed, and 137 subjects with unknown dominant hand. In our observed sample, most cases involved the right temple as the site of entrance gunshot wound (about 67%), followed by the mouth (16%), forehead (7%), left temple (6%), submental (2%), and parietal region (1%). The left temple, right temple, and forehead were the sites of the gunshot entrance wounds, which were the best predictors of the handedness of the deceased (Spearman \u03c1 = 0.149, P = 0.006). Our study showed that the direction of the bullet intracranial path in cases of suicide was even a more potent predictor of the handedness of the deceased (Spearman \u03c1 = 0.263, P = 0.000; Wald = 149.503, P = 0.000).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f610006975","doi":"10.1097\/paf.0b013e31823a8a32","first_seen_on":"2011-11-15T12:00:26+00:00","issns":["0195-7910"],"issue":"","journal":"The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1327729490,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/amjforensicmedicine\/9000\/00000\/Suicidal_Single_Gunshot_Injury_to_the_Head_.99698.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/amjforensicmedicine\/9000\/00000\/Suicidal_Single_Gunshot_Injury_to_the_Head_.99698.pdf","pmid":"22083074","pubdate":"2011-11-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"","subjects":["pathology","jurisprudence"],"title":"Suicidal Single Gunshot Injury to the Head: Differences in Site of Entrance Wound and Direction of the Bullet Path Between Right- and Left-Handed-An Autopsy Study","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/suicidal-single-gunshot-injury-head"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505992,"mean":5.1115236646191,"rank":3108998,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1008884,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505992,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73181,"mean":4.017514238863,"rank":43427,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":21324,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73181,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":467,"mean":2.3756266094421,"rank":269,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":140,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":467,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":1.3564888888889,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
