The hypothesis that it is less disruptive to beneficial invertebrates and their ecosystem services than are other prevailing insecticide classes was tested. Plots in golf course settings were treated with chlorantraniliprole, or with a representative nicotinoid (clothianidin), pyethroid (bifenthrin) or a combination (clothianidin-bifenthrin) formulation. Non-target effects were assessed via pitfall traps (epigeal predators), Tullgren funnel extraction (soil microarthropods), hand sorting (earthworms), counting ant mounds and earthworm casts on tees and putting greens, assessing predation on sentinel pest eggs and comparing grass clipping decomposition in treated versus untreated turf.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100066eb","doi":"10.1002\/ps.2321","first_seen_on":"2011-11-16T01:36:19+00:00","issns":["1526-4998"],"journal":"Pest Management Science","last_mentioned_on":1321404914,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22076810?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22076810","pubdate":"2011-11-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Science And Management","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Comparative impact of an anthranilic diamide and other insecticidal chemistries on beneficial invertebrates and ecosystem services in turfgrass.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparative-impact-anthranilic-diamide-other-insecticidal-chemistries-beneficial-invertebrates-ecosy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506214,"mean":5.1186469373082,"rank":3107962,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":992742,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506214,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66796,"mean":4.1774440601841,"rank":40320,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":17664,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66796,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":496,"mean":2.5468888888889,"rank":277,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":496,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.5,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
