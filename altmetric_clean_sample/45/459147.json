The SCAS was demonstrated to have satisfactory internal consistency with the Spanish sample, and factor analysis confirmed the six-factor original model. Convergent validity was supported by correlations with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children and the welfare dimension of the Child Health and Illness Profile-Children Edition. Low correlations between the SCAS and the Children's Depression Inventory supported the divergent validity. Analysis suggested that anxiety scores decrease with age, and girls reported higher scores than boys. Overall, the SCAS was shown to have good psychometric properties for use with Spanish children by clinicians and researchers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002506","authors":["Orgil\u00e9s M","M\u00e9ndez X","Spence SH","Huedo-Medina TB","Espada JP"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10578-011-0265-y","endpage":"281","first_seen_on":"2011-11-17T12:05:43+00:00","issns":["1573-3327","0009-398X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Child Psychiatry & Human Development","last_mentioned_on":1321529381,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22086155?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22086155","pubdate":"2011-11-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"271","subjects":["psychiatry","pediatrics"],"title":"Spanish Validation of the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale.","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/spanish-validation-spence-childrens-anxiety-scale"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631524,"mean":4.926174121992,"rank":2898538,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":80852,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631524,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":226224,"mean":3.8718271793764,"rank":161275,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":917,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":226224,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207,"mean":3.002427184466,"rank":133,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.4555555555556,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
