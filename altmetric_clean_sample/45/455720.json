News of the Moscow session did not appear in the Italian news media until October, 1948, and for the next three years party biologists struggled over whether to translate the official transcript of the proceedings, The Situation in Biological Science, into Italian. This struggle reveals the complex efforts of the PCI to confirm the ideological and political connection with the Soviet Union, without completely alienating significant milieus of the democratic and antifascist culture in Italy. The apparent impossibility of doing both is indicated by the fact that the project was finally abandoned in March-April, 1951. The article is divided into three sections, each focused on different actors and their response to Lysenkoism. The first section outlines the features of the PCI's pro-Lysenko campaign, with particular regard to the intellectual militancy and organizational commitment of Emilio Sereni, head of PCI's Cultural Commission between 1948 and 1951. The second section analyzes the reaction of the three most important figures in Italian communist biology during this period, Massimiliano Aloisi, Franco Graziosi and Emanuele Padoa. The third section interprets the decision not to publish a translation of The Situation in Biological Science as a consequence of the conflicts between PCI cultural program and the editorial policy of the left-wing publishing house Giulio Einaudi Editore.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4de3cf058f610001d3e","authors":["Francesco Cassata"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10739-011-9286-4","first_seen_on":"2011-11-15T10:38:54+00:00","issns":["0022-5010","1573-0387"],"journal":"Journal of the History of Biology","last_mentioned_on":1320830471,"links":["http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/content\/jt587671808n7122\/"],"pmid":"21701868","pubdate":"2011-06-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"History And Philosophy Of Specific Fields","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Historical Studies","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Social Sciences","Arts and Humanities"],"subjects":["biology","historyofmedicine"],"title":"The Italian Communist Party and the \u201cLysenko Affair\u201d (1948\u20131955)","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/italian-communist-party-lysenko-affair-19481955"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626012,"mean":4.9497445252532,"rank":2907123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":72775,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626012,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70211,"mean":3.7831003275886,"rank":48302,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":270,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70211,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179,"mean":3.1680898876404,"rank":159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
