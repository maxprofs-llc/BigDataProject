A common mechanism by which germline progenitors are protected from differentiation-inducing signals is a transient and global repression of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)-dependent transcription. In both Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, the repression of messenger RNA transcription during germ cell specification correlates with an absence of phosphorylation of Ser 2 residues in the carboxy-terminal domain of RNAPII (hereafter called CTD), a critical modification for transcriptional elongation. Here we show that, in Drosophila embryos, a small protein encoded by polar granule component (pgc) is essential for repressing CTD Ser 2 phosphorylation in newly formed pole cells, the germline progenitors. Ectopic Pgc expression in somatic cells is sufficient to repress CTD Ser 2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, Pgc interacts, physically and genetically, with positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), the CTD Ser 2 kinase complex, and prevents its recruitment to transcription sites. These results indicate that Pgc is a cell-type-specific P-TEFb inhibitor that has a fundamental role in Drosophila germ cell specification. In C. elegans embryos, PIE-1 protein segregates to germline blastomeres, and is thought to repress mRNA transcription through interaction with P-TEFb. Thus, inhibition of P-TEFb is probably a common mechanism during germ cell specification in the disparate organisms C. elegans and Drosophila.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2008Natur.451..730H","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003160","authors":["Kazuko Hanyu-Nakamura","Hiroko Sonobe-Nojima","Akie Tanigawa","Paul Lasko","Akira Nakamura","Hanyu-Nakamura K","Sonobe-Nojima H","Tanigawa A","Lasko P","Nakamura A"],"doi":"10.1038\/nature06498","endpage":"733","first_seen_on":"2011-11-11T12:06:53+00:00","issns":["0028-0836","1476-4687"],"issue":"7179","journal":"Nature","last_mentioned_on":1464774713,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nature\/journal\/v451\/n7179\/abs\/nature06498.html","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18200011","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nature\/journal\/v451\/n7179\/full\/nature06498.html"],"pmid":"18200011","pubdate":"2008-01-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"730","subjects":["science"],"title":"Drosophila Pgc protein inhibits P-TEFb recruitment to chromatin in primordial germ cells","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/nature06498","volume":"451","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/drosophila-pgc-protein-inhibits-ptefb-recruitment-chromatin-primordial-germ-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7842728,"mean":6.6456077751988,"rank":721057,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7114892,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7842728,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88941,"mean":4.9671078030133,"rank":7522,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":81356,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88941,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46532,"mean":71.678891534676,"rank":22448,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":24036,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46532,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":903,"mean":49.015906873614,"rank":537,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":365,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":903,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":11,"Researcher":26,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
