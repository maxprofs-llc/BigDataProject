However, it is currently not completely understood by which cellular mechanisms CDK4\/6 promote tumorigenesis, largely due to the limited number of identified substrates. Here we performed a systematic screen for substrates of cyclin D1-CDK4 and cyclin D3-CDK6. We identified the Forkhead Box M1 (FOXM1) transcription factor as a common critical phosphorylation target. CDK4\/6 stabilize and activate FOXM1, thereby maintain expression of G1\/S phase genes, suppress the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and protect cancer cells from senescence. Melanoma cells, unlike melanocytes, are highly reliant on CDK4\/6-mediated senescence suppression, which makes them particularly susceptible to CDK4\/6 inhibition.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002496","authors":["Piotr Sicinski","Anders L","Ke N","Hydbring P","Choi YJ","Widlund HR","Chick JM","Zhai H","Vidal M","Gygi SP","Braun P","Sicinski P"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ccr.2011.10.001","endpage":"634","first_seen_on":"2011-11-15T09:46:48+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1535-6108","15356108"],"issue":"5","journal":"Cancer Cell","last_mentioned_on":1321345067,"links":["http:\/\/www.cell.com\/cancer-cell\/abstract\/S1535-6108(11)00360-6"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/download.cell.com\/cancer-cell\/pdf\/PIIS1535610811003606.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3237683","pmid":"22094256","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"620","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"A Systematic Screen for CDK4\/6 Substrates Links FOXM1 Phosphorylation to Senescence Suppression in Cancer Cells","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/systematic-screen-cdk46-substrates-links-foxm1-phosphorylation-senescence-suppression-cancer-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630679,"mean":4.9289340563991,"rank":2015511,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":942394,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630679,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70230,"mean":3.7429739281493,"rank":27497,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":30250,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70230,"percentile":43},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1106,"mean":8.2680380090498,"rank":792,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":70,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1106,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":5.7651111111111,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Researcher":42,"Student  > Ph.
