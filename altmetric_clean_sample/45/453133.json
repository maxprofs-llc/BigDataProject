[Yakugaku Zasshi. 2011] - PubMed - NCBI @myen"],"citation":{"abstract":"The intercellular spaces between adjacent epithelial cells are sealed by tight junctions (TJs). Modulation of TJ-seal is a potent strategy for drug absorption. Claudin is a key structural and functional component of TJ-seal. Claudin comprises a tetra-transmembrane protein family consisting of more than 20 members, whose expression profiles and barrier-function differ among tissues. For instance, claudin-1 plays roles in the epidermal and mucosal barriers, and claudin-4 regulates the mucosal barrier. Claudin forms homo- and hetero-type TJ strands. Properties of TJ-seal are determined by combination of the claudin family members. Some claudin strands work as size-selective or charge-selective paracellular routes for solutes. Thus, claudin modulators will make it possible to deliver drugs in a solute- and tissue-specific manner. The C-terminal fragment of the Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (C-CPE) is the most characterized claudin modulator. In this review, we describe potency of claudin-targeting mucosal absorption, and we mentioned development of a novel claudin modulator using C-CPE as a prototype.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d2e","first_seen_on":"2011-11-13T01:19:04+00:00","issns":["1347-5231"],"issue":"11","journal":"Yakugaku Zasshi = Journal of Pharmaceutical Society of Japan","last_mentioned_on":1321142036,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22041696?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22041696","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacy","pharmacology"],"title":"A Non-invasive Drug Delivery System Using Claudin Binder.","type":"article","volume":"131"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506214,"mean":5.1186469373082,"rank":2325677,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1541107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506214,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73870,"mean":4.0487332710609,"rank":29515,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":32428,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73870,"percentile":43},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":394,"mean":1.4075216284987,"rank":125,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":208,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":394,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/zbou1978\/status\/135505638401900544","citation_ids":[453133],"posted_on":"2011-11-12T23:53:56+00:00","author":{"id_on_source":"zbou1978","tweeter_id":116710583},"tweet_id":"135505638401900544"}]}}
