The primary psychoactive constituent of this plant, \u0394(9) -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is an FDA approved medication to treat nausea and emesis caused by cancer chemotherapeutic agents as well as to stimulate appetite in AIDS patients suffering from cachexia. The effects of THC are mediated through the endocannabinoid system (ECS), which promotes a positive energy balance through stimulation of appetite as well as shifting homeostatic mechanisms toward energy storage. Here we discuss the physiological function of the ECS in energy balance and the therapeutic potential of targeting this system.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008482","authors":["Gamage, Thomas F.","Lichtman, Aron H."],"doi":"10.1002\/pbc.23367","endpage":"148","first_seen_on":"2011-11-14T14:01:16+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1545-5017","1545-5009"],"issue":"1","journal":"Pediatric Blood and Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1457461186,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/pbc.23367","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/pbc.23367"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/pbc.23367\/pdf","pmid":"22076835","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"144","subjects":["neoplasms","hematology","pediatrics"],"title":"The Endocannabinoid System: Role in Energy Regulation","type":"article","volume":"58","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/endocannabinoid-system-role-energy-regulation-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7367723,"mean":6.4010630515065,"rank":1083131,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6281659,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7367723,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86536,"mean":4.8131218582077,"rank":11967,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":74524,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86536,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1881,"mean":2.2322914893617,"rank":110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":1770,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1881,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":1.2086956521739,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
