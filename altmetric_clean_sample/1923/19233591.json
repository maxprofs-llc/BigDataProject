Patients with FAP has a high risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC) from these colorectal adenomatous polyps by the mean age of diagnosis at 40 years. Germline mutations of the APC gene cause familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Colectomy has recommended for the FAP patients with significant polyposis. Here, we present a clinical molecular study of a four generation Chinese family with FAP. Clinical diagnosis of FAP has been done according to the phenotype, family history and medical records. Patient's blood samples were collected and genomic DNA was extracted. In order to identify the pathogenic mutation underlying the disease phenotype targeted next-generation sequencing and confirmatory sanger sequencing has undertaken. Targeted next generation sequencing identified a novel heterozygous splice-acceptor site mutation [c.1744-1G>A] in intron 14 of APC gene, which is co-segregated with the FAP phenotypes in the proband and amongst all the affected family members. This mutation is not present in unaffected family members and in normal healthy controls of same ethnic origin. According to the LOVD database for Chinese colorectal cancer patients, in Chinese population, 60% of the previously reported APC gene mutations causes FAP, are missense mutations. This novel splice-acceptor site mutation causing FAP in this Chinese family expands the germline mutation spectrum of the APC gene in the Chinese population.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Dan Wang","Shengyun Liang","Zhao Zhang","Guoru Zhao","Yuan Hu","Shengran Liang","Xipeng Zhang","Santasree Banerjee"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.15570","first_seen_on":"2017-04-21T11:59:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"issue":"13","journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1492775347,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28423518?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28423518","pubdate":"2017-04-21T22:09:21+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"A novel pathogenic splice acceptor site germline mutation in intron 14 of the <i>APC<\/i> gene in a Chinese family with familial adenomatous polyposis","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-pathogenic-splice-acceptor-site-germline-mutation-intron-14-apc-gene-chinese-family-familial-a"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8085159,"mean":6.8783507387159,"rank":7000068,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8085159,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233055,"mean":12.781294000532,"rank":189758,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233055,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8508,"mean":3.0989594451628,"rank":5906,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8508,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1199,"mean":2.3461585976628,"rank":675,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1199,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/statuses\/855387921687257088","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19233591],"posted_on":"2017-04-21T11:49:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":439},"tweet_id":"855387921687257088"}]}}
