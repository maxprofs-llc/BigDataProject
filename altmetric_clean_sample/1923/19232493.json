Nevertheless, standard cisplatin-based chemotherapy is not curative in a small subgroup of patients. Previously, we showed that PD-L1 overexpression is associated with worse prognosis in TGCTs, while tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are prognostic in different types of cancer. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of PD-1 and PD-L1 expressing TILs in TGCTs.\nPD-L1 positive TILs were found significantly more often in seminomas (95.9% of patients) and embryonal carcinomas (91.0%) compared to yolk sac tumors (60.0%), choriocarcinomas (54.5%) or teratomas (35.7%) (All p < 0.05). TGCTs patients with high infiltration of PD-L1 positive TILs (HS \u2265 160) had significantly better progression-free survival (HR = 0.17, 95% CI 0.09 - 0.31, p = 0.0006) and overall survival (HR = 0.08, 95% CI 0.04 - 0.16, p = 0.001) opposite to patients with lower expression of PD-L1 (HS < 150). PD-1 expressing TILs were not prognostic in TGCTs.\nSurgical specimens from 240 patients with primary TGCTs were included into this translational study. The PD-1 and PD-L1 expression on tumor and TILs were detected by immunohistochemistry using anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody. Scoring was performed semiquantitatively by weighted histoscore (HS) method.\nThe prognostic value of PD-L1 expressing TILs in TGCTs was demonstrated for the first time.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Michal Chovanec","Zuzana Cierna","Viera Miskovska","Katarina Machalekova","Daniela Svetlovska","Katarina Kalavska","Katarina Rejlekova","Stanislav Spanik","Karol Kajo","Pavel Babal","Jozef Mardiak","Michal Mego"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.15585","first_seen_on":"2017-04-21T10:48:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"issue":"13","journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1492771687,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28423520?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28423520","pubdate":"2017-04-21T22:09:21+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Prognostic role of programmed-death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expressing tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in testicular germ cell tumors","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prognostic-role-programmeddeath-ligand-1-pdl1-expressing-tumor-infiltrating-lymphocytes-testicular-g"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8085159,"mean":6.8783507387159,"rank":7000067,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8085159,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233054,"mean":12.781364075982,"rank":189758,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233054,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8508,"mean":3.0989594451628,"rank":5906,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8508,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1199,"mean":2.3461585976628,"rank":675,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1199,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
