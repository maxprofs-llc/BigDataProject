The present study enrolled 1210 gastric cancer patients (949 males and 261 females). Forced vital capacity (FVC) and maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV) were measured as a percent of predicted values. We then analyzed associations between patient pulmonary function and both prognosis and postoperative complications. Patient 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were 88.8%, 65.7% and 53.0%, respectively. FVC and MVV optimal cutoff values were 87.0 (P=0.003) and 83.6 (P=0.026), respectively. Low FVC and low MVV were associated with higher rates of postoperative fever (23.8% vs. 13.9%, P<0.001; 17.8% vs. 13.3%, P=0.049, respectively) and poor patient prognosis (5-year overall survival: 43.5% vs. 57.6%, P=0.003; 51.8% vs. 54.3%, P=0.026, respectively). Only low FVC was an independent prognostic predictor for gastric cancer (P=0.012). In subgroup analyses, FVC was not associated with stage I or II gastric cancer patient prognoses (P>0.05), but low FVC was an independent risk factor for poor prognosis in stage III gastric cancer cases (P=0.004). These findings indicate that low FVC is predictive of poorer prognosis and higher risk of postoperative fever in gastric cancer patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Fan Feng","Yangzi Tian","Yuan Zang","Li Sun","Liu Hong","Jianjun Yang","Man Guo","Xiao Lian","Daiming Fan","Hongwei Zhang"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.15953","first_seen_on":"2017-04-21T12:01:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1492775735,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28423645?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28423645","pubdate":"2017-04-21T22:09:01+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Low forced vital capacity predicts poor prognosis in gastric cancer patients","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8085159,"mean":6.8783507387159,"rank":4275028,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2244272,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8085159,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233055,"mean":12.781290782393,"rank":130033,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":81863,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233055,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8508,"mean":3.0989594451628,"rank":2743,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4787,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8508,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1199,"mean":2.3455325542571,"rank":356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":767,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1199,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/dermatologyf\/statuses\/855389547001073664","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19233657],"posted_on":"2017-04-21T11:55:35+00:00","author":{"name":"dermatologyf","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2046835740\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Dermatology News","id_on_source":"dermatologyf","tweeter_id":"546505902","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":58},"tweet_id":"855389547001073664"}]}}
