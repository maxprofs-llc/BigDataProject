Cytotoxicity was detected by cell viability and Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Flow cytometry analysis was applied to assess mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) loss, intracellular Ca(2+) and apoptosis. To clarify the mechanism of SiNPs-induced apoptosis, intrinsic apoptosis-related proteins were detected. Our results showed that SiNPs caused cytotoxicity, cell membrane damage and Ca(2+) increase in a dose-dependent manner in SH-SY5Y cells. Both the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) loss and potential mitochondria damage resulted in Cyt C release to the cytoplasm. The elevated Cyt C and Apaf1 further triggered intrinsic apoptosis via executive molecular caspase-9 and caspase-3. The present study confirmed that SiNPs induced intrinsic apoptosis in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells via CytC\/Apaf-1 pathway and provided a better understanding of the potential toxicity induced by SiNPs on human neurocyte.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027f1","authors":["Yanyan Yang","Yongbo Yu","Jiahui Wang","Yanbo Li","Yang Li","Jia Wei","Tong Zheng","Minghua Jin","Zhiwei Sun"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.etap.2017.01.010","first_seen_on":"2017-04-21T10:29:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["13826689","1872-7077"],"journal":"Environmental Toxicology & Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1492770544,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28426994?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28426994","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Science And Management","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth","pharmacology"],"title":"Silica nanoparticles induced intrinsic apoptosis in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells via CytC\/Apaf-1 pathway","type":"article","volume":"52","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/silica-nanoparticles-induced-intrinsic-apoptosis-neuroblastoma-shsy5y-cells-via-cytcapaf1-pathway"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8085159,"mean":6.8783507387159,"rank":7000072,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8085159,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233054,"mean":12.781374588613,"rank":189760,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233054,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":468,"mean":3.6587109207709,"rank":357,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":468,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.0730769230769,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Materials Science":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OTO_docs\/statuses\/855367776705273858","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19231958],"posted_on":"2017-04-21T10:29:04+00:00","author":{"name":"OTOdocs","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/451475015045615617\/pvQ7oTD5_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Otolaryngology papers in #PubMed and #arXiv.","id_on_source":"OTO_docs","tweeter_id":"2424371810","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":385},"tweet_id":"855367776705273858"}]}}
