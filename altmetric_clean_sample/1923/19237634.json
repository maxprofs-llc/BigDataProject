Among gymnophthalmids, the genus Colobosaura is a member of the tribe Iphisini, and currently is considered monotypic (C. modesta). The diversity of the tribe was studied recently, with the erection of several new genera. In this work genetic and morphological data of specimens of Colobosaura recently collected in Paraguay were analyzed. Genetic (16S barcode) data indicate that these samples are not conspecific with C. modesta and they are allocated to the nominal species C. kraepelini. Because the original primary type of the latter taxon is considered to be lost, a neotype (SMF 101370) is designated for this species and a redescription provided based on our material. Colobosaura kraepelini is distributed in the Humid Chaco, being the only member of the whole tribe in this ecoregion.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53d3cf058f610004744","authors":["Pier Cacciali","Nicol\u00e1s Mart\u00ednez","Gunther K\u00f6hler"],"doi":"10.3897\/zookeys.669.12245","first_seen_on":"2017-04-21T15:29:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1313-2970","1313-2989"],"issue":"669","journal":"ZooKeys","last_mentioned_on":1498571102,"links":["http:\/\/zookeys.pensoft.net\/articles.php?id=12245","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3897\/zookeys.669.12245","https:\/\/zookeys.pensoft.net\/articles.php?id=12245"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/zookeys.pensoft.net\/lib\/ajax_srv\/article_elements_srv.php?action=download_pdf&item_id=12245","pmcid":"PMC5523374","pmid":"28769654","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Pensoft Publishers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Revision of the phylogeny and chorology of the tribe Iphisini with the revalidation of Colobosaura kraepelini Werner, 1910 (Reptilia, Squamata, Gymnophthalmidae)","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/revision-phylogeny-chorology-tribe-iphisini-revalidation-colobosaura-kraepelini-werner-1910-reptilia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":14.514,"score_history":{"1y":14.514,"6m":14.514,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":14.514},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8430317,"mean":7.0913096536278,"rank":605292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7825084,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8430317,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":247891,"mean":12.905081616846,"rank":29840,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":218051,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":247891,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2513,"mean":15.410149681529,"rank":475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":2038,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2513,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":11.778738461538,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":3,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"JP":1,"GB":2,"FR":1,"US":2},"mendeley":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ZooKeys_Journal\/statuses\/855443357790871552","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19237634],"posted_on":"2017-04-21T15:29:24+00:00","author":{"name":"ZooKeys","url":"http:\/\/zookeys.pensoft.net","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1154517305\/zookeys_logo_normal.jpg","description":"The next generation open access peer-reviewed journal in systematic zoology.
