The aim of this longitudinal study was to assess temporal changes in morbidity and mortality of patients with EA\/TEF treated in a tertiary-level center, focusing on postoperative complications and their impact on long-term gastroesophageal function.\nOne hundred nine consecutive patients with EA\/TEF born between 1975 and 2011 were followed for a median of 9.6 years (range, 3-27 years). Comparative statistics were used to evaluate temporal changes between an early (1975-1989) and late (1990-2011) study period.\nGross types of EA were A (n\u00a0=\u00a06), B (n\u00a0=\u00a05), C (n\u00a0=\u00a089), D (n\u00a0=\u00a07), and E (n\u00a0=\u00a02). Seventy (64.2%) patients had coexisting anomalies, 13 (11.9%) of whom died before EA correction was completed. In the remaining 96 infants, surgical repair was primary (n\u00a0=\u00a066) or delayed (n\u00a0=\u00a025) anastomosis, closure of TEF in EA type E (n\u00a0=\u00a02), and esophageal replacement with colon interposition (n=2) or gastric transposition (n=1). Long-gap EA was diagnosed in 23 (24.0%) cases. Postoperative mortality was 4\/96 (4.2%). Overall survival increased significantly between the two study periods (42\/55 vs. 50\/54; P\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Sixty-nine (71.9%) patients presented postoperatively with anastomotic strictures requiring a median of 3 (range, 1-15) dilatations. Revisional surgery was required for anastomotic leakage (n\u00a0=\u00a05), recurrent TEF with (n\u00a0=\u00a01) or without (n=9) anastomotic stricture, undetected proximal TEF (n\u00a0=\u00a04), and refractory anastomotic strictures with (n\u00a0=\u00a01) or without (n\u00a0=\u00a02) fistula. Normal dietary intake was achieved in 89 (96.7%) patients, while 3 (3.3%) remained dependent on gastrostomy feedings. Manometry showed esophageal dysmotility in 78 (84.8%) infants at 1\u00a0year of age, increasing to 100% at 10-year follow-up. Fifty-six (60.9%) patients suffered from dysphagia with need for endoscopic foreign body removal in 12 (13.0%) cases. Anti-reflux medication was required in 43 (46.7%) children and 30 (32.6%) underwent fundoplication. The rate of gastroesophageal reflux increased significantly between the two study periods (29\/42 vs. 44\/50; P\u00a0=\u00a00.04). Twenty-two (23.9%) cases of endoscopic esophagitis and one Barrett's esophagus were identified.\nPostoperative complications after EA\/TEF repair are common and should be expertly managed to reduce the risk of long-term morbidity. Regular multidisciplinary surveillance with transitional care into adulthood is recommended in all patients with EA\/TEF.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002db8","authors":["Florian Friedmacher","Birgit Kroneis","Andrea Huber-Zeyringer","Peter Schober","Holger Till","Hugo Sauer","Michael E.
