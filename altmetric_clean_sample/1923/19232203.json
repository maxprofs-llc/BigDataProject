Primary tumors of the cases selected were known to be HER2 negative. Also, immunohistochemistry for estrogen and progesterone receptors was performed on 36 cases from the same cohort to assess any discrepancy between the primary tumor and the lymph node metastases.\nOut of 39 cases, one case was HER2 amplified in lymph node metastasis compared to non-amplified primary tumor. Approximately eight percent of cases (3\/36) were estrogen receptor-negative in LN metastasis and 5.55% (2\/36) were less strongly positive compared to the positive primary tumors. Nineteen percent (7\/36) were progesterone receptor-negative in lymph node metastasis in contrast to the matched positive primary tumors, and 5.55% (2\/36) were progesterone receptor-positive in lymph node as compared to their corresponding negative primary tumors.\nWhile most matched primary breast tumors and lymph node metastases show concordance in HER2, estrogen and progesterone receptor status, we confirmed the multiple reports that identified discordant results in a subset of cases. These results support the newly adopted guidelines that require testing for HER2 on metastatic lesions.","authors":["Mohamed Mokhtar Desouki","Ihab Shafek Atta","Daynna J Wolff","Sally E Self"],"doi":"10.5146\/tjpath.2015.01354","first_seen_on":"2017-04-21T10:40:53+00:00","issns":["1018-5615","1309-5730"],"issue":"3","journal":"Turk patoloji dergisi","last_mentioned_on":1492771237,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27562392?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27562392","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Comparison between her2, estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors in primary breast carcinomas and matched lymph node metastases","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-between-her2-estrogen-receptors-progesterone-receptors-primary-breast-carcinomas-matched"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/855370682976280577","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19232203],"posted_on":"2017-04-21T10:40:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":714},"tweet_id":"855370682976280577"}]}}
