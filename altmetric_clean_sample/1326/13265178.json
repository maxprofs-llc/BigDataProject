Our aim was to analyze the impact of this on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients included in the HERACLES cohort during the first 6\u00a0months of its implementation. The HERACLES cohort (NCT02511496) was set up in March 2015 to evaluate the status and follow-up of chronic HCV infection in patients co-infected with HIV in the south of Spain. In September 2015, the data were analyzed to identify clinical events (death, liver decompensation, and liver fibrosis progression) and rate of treatment implementation in this population. The study population comprised a total of 3474 HIV\/HCV co-infected patients. The distribution according to liver fibrosis stage was: 1152\u00a0F0-F1 (33.2\u00a0%); 513\u00a0F2 (14.4\u00a0%); 641\u00a0F3 (18.2\u00a0%); 761\u00a0F4 (21.9\u00a0%); and 407 whose liver fibrosis was not measured (12.3\u00a0%). During follow-up, 248 patients progressed by at least one fibrosis stage [7.1\u00a0%; 95\u00a0% confidence interval (CI): 6.3-8\u00a0%]. Among cirrhotic patients, 52 (6.8\u00a0%; 95\u00a0% CI: 5.2-8.9\u00a0%) developed hepatic decompensation. In the overall population, 50 patients died (1.4\u00a0%; 95\u00a0% CI: 1.1-1.9\u00a0%). Eight hundred and nineteen patients (23.56\u00a0%) initiated interferon (IFN)-free treatment during follow-up, of which 47.8\u00a0% were cirrhotic. In our study, during 6\u00a0months of follow-up, 23.56\u00a0% of HIV\/HCV co-infected patients included in our cohort received HCV treatment. However, we observed a high incidence of negative short-term outcomes in our population.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002828","authors":["Rivero-Juarez, A","Lopez-Cortes, L F","Casta\u00f1o, M","Merino, D","Marquez, M","Mancebo, M","Cuenca-Lopez, F","Jimenez-Aguilar, P","Lopez-Montesinos, I","Lopez-Cardenas, S","Collado, A","Lopez-Ruz, M A","Omar, M","Tellez, F","Perez-Stachowski, X","Hernandez-Quero, J","Gir\u00f3n-Gonzalez, J A","Fernandez-Fuertes, E","Rivero, A",", "],"doi":"10.1007\/s10096-016-2822-6","first_seen_on":"2016-11-02T06:25:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1435-4373","0934-9723"],"journal":"European Journal of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1479493750,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27787664"],"pmid":"27787664","pubdate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology","communicablediseases"],"title":"Impact of universal access to hepatitis C therapy on HIV-infected patients: implementation of the Spanish national hepatitis C strategy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-universal-access-hepatitis-c-therapy-hivinfected-patients-implementation-spanish-national-hep"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.2,"score_history":{"1y":3.2,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451417,"mean":7.1044089350157,"rank":2131903,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":6302092,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451417,"percentile":74},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245347,"mean":13.044565821329,"rank":83324,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":161186,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245347,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1254,"mean":2.7184644852354,"rank":193,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":1056,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1254,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":3.2952941176471,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
