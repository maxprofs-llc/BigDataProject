A p value of less than .05 was considered statistically significant. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to adjust for confounding factors.\nWe observed invasive disease in 11 cases, with microinvasion in 8 of them. A positive surgical margin was found in 10 patients. During a median follow-up period of 79.5 months, 8 patients (29.6%) showed a first recurrence after a median (range) time of 4.9(2.3-7.1) years. No significant differences were observed between patients with recurrence and patients without recurrence with respect to age, number of vulvar sectors involved, bilaterality and multifocality, presence of invasion or microinvasion, and surgical margin status. However, during the follow-up period, the presence of invasion was higher (67% vs 41%) in patients with recurrence compared with patients without recurrence.\nThe rate of recurrence of the disease after therapy is high. Patients should be subjected to a close and long-term follow-up to identify those who must undergo further treatment, especially if they presented with an invasive or even microinvasive disease. A free margin of no greater than 1 to 2 cm might be the most appropriate surgical choice.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007d25","authors":["Sopracordevole, Francesco","Di Giuseppe, Jacopo","De Piero, Giovanni","Canzonieri, Vincenzo","Buttignol, Monica","Giorda, Giorgio","Ciavattini, Andrea"],"doi":"10.1097\/lgt.0000000000000191","first_seen_on":"2016-02-18T14:10:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1089-2591","1526-0976"],"journal":"Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease","last_mentioned_on":1455799871,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jlgtd\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Surgical_Treatment_of_Paget_Disease_of_the_Vulva__.99631.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jlgtd\/9000\/00000\/Surgical_Treatment_of_Paget_Disease_of_the_Vulva__.99631.pdf","pmid":"26882125","pubdate":"2016-02-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["gynecology"],"title":"Surgical Treatment of Paget Disease of the Vulva:  Prognostic Significance of Stromal Invasion and Surgical Margin Status.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jlgtd\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Surgical_Treatment_of_Paget_Disease_of_the_Vulva__.99631.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/surgical-treatment-paget-disease-vulva-prognostic-significance-stromal-invasion-surgical-margin-stat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7211484,"mean":6.3513465940328,"rank":5428100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":993245,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7211484,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283223,"mean":10.314020513943,"rank":197998,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":45771,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283223,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":286,"mean":3.2824771929825,"rank":184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":286,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":11.580909090909,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JLGTD\/statuses\/700301533557067776","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5631327],"posted_on":"2016-02-18T12:51:11+00:00","author":{"name":"JLGTD","url":"http:\/\/www.asccp.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/545632611918286849\/IzTUFgOZ_normal.png","description":"The Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease, is sponsored by the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology, the International Society for the Study","id_on_source":"JLGTD","tweeter_id":"2851779569","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":124},"tweet_id":"700301533557067776"}]}}
