Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) have long been explored as drug delivery systems and nanomedicines against cancer. There are high expectations for their use in therapy and diagnosis. These filaments can translocate inside cultured cells and intermingle with the protein nanofilaments of the cytoskeleton, interfering with the biomechanics of cell division mimicking the effect of traditional microtubule-binding anti-cancer drugs such as paclitaxel. Here, it is shown how MWCNTs can trigger significant anti-tumoral effects in vivo, in solid malignant melanomas produced by allograft transplantation. Interestingly, the MWCNT anti-tumoral effects are maintained even in solid melanomas generated from paclitaxel-resistant cells. These findings provide great expectation in the development of groundbreaking adjuvant synthetic microtubule-stabilizing chemotherapies to overcome drug resistance in cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006894","authors":["Garc\u00eda-Hevia, Lorena","Villegas, Juan C","Fern\u00e1ndez, Fidel","Casafont, \u00cd\u00f1igo","Gonz\u00e1lez, Jes\u00fas","Valiente, Rafael","Fanarraga, M\u00f3nica L","Garc\u00eda\u2010Hevia, Lorena","Villegas, Juan C.","Fanarraga, M\u00f3nica L."],"doi":"10.1002\/adhm.201500753","endpage":"1087","first_seen_on":"2016-02-18T17:50:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["2192-2659"],"issue":"9","journal":"Advanced Healthcare Materials","last_mentioned_on":1459540489,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26866927\/?i=2&from=idival","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26866927","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/adhm.201500753\/abstract;jsessionid=8BB647DC8CDAEFFA6E742AD6D1A4C398.f03t03"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/adhm.201500753\/pdf","pmid":"26866927","pubdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"1080","subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes Inhibit Tumor Progression in a Mouse Model","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multiwalled-carbon-nanotubes-inhibit-tumor-progression-mouse-model-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7474500,"mean":6.4836868429538,"rank":5656128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1000904,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7474500,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284730,"mean":10.396536208113,"rank":200731,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":41445,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284730,"percentile":14},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":805,"mean":7.1687089552239,"rank":641,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":64,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":805,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":13.766901960784,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Lecturer":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DireccionIDIVAL\/statuses\/700366184957550594","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5632851],"posted_on":"2016-02-18T17:08:05+00:00","author":{"name":"IDIVAL","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/706426679732920320\/SZpD7yJQ_normal.jpg","description":"Valdecilla Biomedical Research Institute.
