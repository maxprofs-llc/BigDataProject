After diagnosis, the patients were randomized to 4 groups: Medicaid early (n = 9) or late support (n = 9) and non-Medicaid early (n = 11) or late support (n = 10). Early access to the APN was at the family meeting and later at 3 months after diagnosis. Data included demographic information and completion by phone interview at 3 months postdiagnosis of a questionnaire on the usefulness of the assessment and parent's desire or ability to obtain recommended services.\nDemographically, the groups were not different. Children were most frequently male, white, non-Hispanic, and non-Medicaid with a mean age of 35 months. In comparison with the non-Medicaid groups, the Medicaid groups more often endorsed the 9 questions on the usefulness of the assessment as being \"A Great Deal\" useful (p = .022). Groups with early support were more successful in scheduling or completing appointments for recommended services overall including medical, educational, therapeutic, and parent resource appointments (p = .031). Barriers to services or resources were reported by 35.9%.\nParents of young children with Medicaid with a recent diagnosis of ASD found the assessment \"very useful\" compared with non-Medicaid group. The groups with immediate access to an APN were more successful with scheduling and completing appointments.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6013cf058f61000629a","authors":["Roth, Beth Mishkind","Kralovic, Shanna","Roizen, Nancy J","Spannagel, Sarah Cain","Minich, Nori","Knapp, Julie","Roizen, Nancy J."],"doi":"10.1097\/dbp.0000000000000261","first_seen_on":"2016-02-19T11:32:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1536-7312","0196-206X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Developmental & Behavioral Pediatrics","last_mentioned_on":1461417585,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26890560","http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jrnldbp\/9000\/00000\/Impact_of_Autism_Navigator_on_Access_to_Services_.99539.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jrnldbp\/9000\/00000\/Impact_of_Autism_Navigator_on_Access_to_Services_.99539.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jrnldbp\/Abstract\/2016\/04000\/Impact_of_Autism_Navigator_on_Access_to_Services.2.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jrnldbp\/Fulltext\/2016\/04000\/Impact_of_Autism_Navigator_on_Access_to_Services.2.aspx?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook"],"pmid":"26890560","pubdate":"2016-02-19T22:00:23+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences","pediatrics"],"title":"Impact of Autism Navigator on Access to Services","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jrnldbp\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Impact_of_Autism_Navigator_on_Access_to_Services_.99539.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-autism-navigator-access-services"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7591700,"mean":6.5431604635494,"rank":3167432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4314540,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7591700,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":286333,"mean":10.441369801489,"rank":112851,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":167973,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":286333,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1063,"mean":7.928384180791,"rank":523,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":520,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1063,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":22.755463414634,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
