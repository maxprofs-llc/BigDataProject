We present a case of medulloblastoma with large suprasellar metastasis at initial presentation. A 3-year and 5-month-old boy presented with a 1-month history of vomiting and loss of appetite, and body weight. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 20mm\u00d720mm mass in the suprasellar region and a 30mm\u00d730mm mass in the fourth cerebral ventricle. We performed endoscopic biopsy of the suprasellar tumour, and subsequently totally removed the vermian tumour through a suboccipital craniotomy. The histopathological findings revealed that both the suprasellar and vermian tumours were classic type and non SHH\/WNT type medulloblastoma. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient showed complete remission after chemotherapy. The tumour in the suprasellar region was most likely metastatic from the vermis. Endoscopic biopsy of the tumour in the suprasellar region and total removal of the tumour in the vermis in a one-stage operation followed by intensive chemotherapy with reduced dose radiotherapy may provide a satisfactory outcome.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9163cf058f61000cf55","authors":["Hiroaki Nagashima","Tatsuya Nagashima","Atsufumi Kawamura","Kazuki Yamamoto","Makiko Yoshida","Daiichiro Hasegawa","Yoshiyuki Kosaka","Eiji Kohmura","Nagashima, Hiroaki","Nagashima, Tatsuya","Kawamura, Atsufumi","Yamamoto, Kazuki","Yoshida, Makiko","Hasegawa, Daiichiro","Kosaka, Yoshiyuki","Kohmura, Eiji"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pjnns.2016.02.001","first_seen_on":"2016-02-19T07:08:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00283843","0028-3843"],"issue":"3","journal":"Neurologia i neurochirurgia polska","last_mentioned_on":1468319347,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0028384316000335&_version=1&md5=eaae980a4030a93fc3d3aa28247a66e1","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27154451?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27154451","pubdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurosurgery","neurology"],"title":"Medulloblastoma with suprasellar solitary massive metastasis: Case report","type":"article","volume":"50","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/medulloblastoma-suprasellar-solitary-massive-metastasis-case-report"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8069135,"mean":6.8476973499224,"rank":6130044,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1081730,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8069135,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":289066,"mean":10.644042052825,"rank":204514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":41740,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":289066,"percentile":14},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":224,"mean":1.6625560538117,"rank":103,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":82,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":224,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":0.70757575757576,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Psychology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"PT":1},"mendeley":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/700576616309633024","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5636393],"posted_on":"2016-02-19T07:04:16+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":964},"tweet_id":"700576616309633024"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/braintumor_UL\/statuses\/752812022316707840","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5636393],"posted_on":"2016-07-12T10:29:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Brain tumor ULisboa","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/687579003163643904\/d5iTojK9_normal.jpg","description":"Follow for the latest updates on Brain tumors.
