Fast and Blaisdell (2011) reported that rats use the representation of an associatively retrieved event to guide behavior in ambiguous situations. Rats were reinforced for lever-pressing during 1 of 2 lights but not both lights. They were then tested with 1 light illuminated while the second light was either covered by an opaque shield (ambiguous) or uncovered and unlit (explicitly absent). Rats lever-pressed less when the second light was covered compared with unlit, suggesting that a representation of the ambiguously absent light guided their behavior. However, Dwyer and Burgess (2011) offered an alternative mechanism in which the explicit absence of a cue gains associative value during training. Covering the light at test could effectively remove these associative properties, resulting in a generalization decrement of behavior. The current experiments were designed to test contrasting predictions made by these 2 accounts. Experiment 1 empirically established that generalization decrement can occur when an element of a compound cue is presented alone at test, but this decrement is attenuated, rather than enhanced, when the absent element is covered. Experiment 2 utilized a conditioned inhibition procedure to demonstrate that rat behavior during cue ambiguity is driven by an associatively retrieved representation rather than by generalization decrement. Collectively, the results argue against a purely nonrepresentational associative account of behavior and support a role for associatively retrieved representations in rats.
