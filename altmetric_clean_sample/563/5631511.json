Beef steers (64 pens; 8 steers\/pen) were allocated to a randomized complete block design with a 2 \u00d7 2 factorial treatment arrangement. Factor 1 consisted of diet, with cattle fed a conventional (CON) diet or a diet consisting of Programmed Nutrition Beef Program (PN) supplements. The PN treatment included Programmed Nutrition Beef Receiver fed from d 1 through 20 of feeding and Programmed Nutrition Beef Finisher fed from d 21 to harvest. Factor 2 evaluated the presence (EGP+) or absence (EGP-) of exogenous growth promotants (ExGP) in the production system. Steers in the EGP+ treatments were initially implanted with Component E-S, reimplanted with Component TE-IS, and fed 400 mg\u00b7animal\u00b7dof ractopamine hydrochloride for the final 28 d before harvest. Steers were harvested on d 175, and strip loins were removed from 2 carcasses selected at random from each pen for transport to Kansas State University. One 1.27-cm-thick steak was removed from the anterior face for proximate and long-chain fatty acid analysis. There were no diet \u00d7 ExGP interactions ( > 0.10) for feedlot performance except for DMI ( = 0.02). Steers in the PN\/EGP+ treatment consumed more feed than all other treatments ( < 0.05). Both diet and ExGP affected DMI ( < 0.05), with PN and EGP+ steers consuming more feed than their contemporaries. Gain:feed and ADG were unaffected ( > 0.10) by diet, but ExGP improved these measures ( < 0.01). There were no diet \u00d7 ExGP interactions for carcass characteristics except KPH fat and percentages of yield grade 3 and 4 carcasses ( < 0.05). Diet affected total incidence of liver abscesses because PN steers had a greater ( = 0.05) incidence of liver abscesses than steers in the CON treatment. Diet did not affect the other carcass characteristics ( > 0.10). Use of ExGP increased ( < 0.05) HCW, LM area, and 12th-rib fat but did not affect ( > 0.10) marbling score. Using ExGP reduced the percentage carcasses grading Premium Choice ( < 0.05). No diet \u00d7 ExGP interactions or diet effects were detected for long-chain fatty acid profiles ( > 0.10). Use of ExGP increased ( < 0.05) the ratio of saturated:unsaturated fatty acids. In summary, the alternative feeding strategy presented in this study produced similar feedlot performance and carcass characteristics compared with a conventional feedlot system.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c86","authors":["Phelps, K J","Drouillard, J S","Jennings, J S","Depenbusch, B E","Van Bibber-Krueger, C L","Miller, K A","Vaughn, M A","Burnett, D D","Gonzalez, J M"],"doi":"10.2527\/jas.2014-8661","first_seen_on":"2016-02-18T14:44:22+00:00","issns":["1525-3163"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Animal Science","last_mentioned_on":1455801906,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26020906?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26020906","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Effects of the Programmed Nutrition Beef Program on feedlot performance and carcass characteristics","type":"article","volume":"93","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-programmed-nutrition-beef-program-feedlot-performance-carcass-characteristics"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7211484,"mean":6.3513465940328,"rank":5428109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":993234,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7211484,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283224,"mean":10.31399910318,"rank":198000,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":45767,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283224,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1569,"mean":3.4413737244898,"rank":1122,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":316,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1569,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":1.9076470588235,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
