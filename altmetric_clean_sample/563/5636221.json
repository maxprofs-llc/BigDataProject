From February 2013 to May 2013, 83 hospitals (about 40,000 hospital beds) prospectively collected non-duplicate Enterobacteriaceae using the screening cut-off recommended by EUCAST. Carbapenemase characterisation was performed by phenotypic methods and confirmed by PCR and sequencing. MLST types were determined for Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. A total of 702 Enterobacteriaceae isolates met the inclusion criteria; 379 (54%) were CPE. OXA-48 (71.5%) and VIM-1 (25.3%) were the most frequent carbapenemases, and K. pneumoniae (74.4%), Enterobacter cloacae (10.3%), and E. coli (8.4%) were the species most affected. Susceptibility to colistin, amikacin and meropenem was 95.5%, 81.3%, and 74.7%, respectively. The most prevalent STs were ST11 and ST405 in K. pneumoniae, and ST131 in E. coli. Forty-five (54.1%) of the hospitals had at least one CPE case. In K. pneumoniae, ST11\/OXA-48, ST15\/OXA-48, ST405\/OXA-48, and ST11\/VIM-1 were detected in two or more Spanish provinces. ST11 carried four carbapenemases (VIM-1, OXA-48, KPC-2, and OXA-245), but ST405 carried OXA-48 only. A wide interregional spread of CPE in Spain was observed mainly due to a few successful clones of OXA-48-producing K. pneumoniae (e.g. ST11 and ST405). Dissemination of OXA-48-producing E. coli is a new finding of public health concern. According to in vitro susceptibilities, most of the CPE (94.5%) had three or more options of antibiotic treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a6a","authors":["Oteo, Jes\u00fas","Ortega, Adriana","Bartolom\u00e9, Rosa","Bou, Germ\u00e1n","Conejo, Carmen","Fern\u00e1ndez-Mart\u00ednez, Marta","Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez, Juan Jos\u00e9","Mart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda, Laura","Mart\u00ednez-Mart\u00ednez, Luis","Merino, Mar\u00eda","Mir\u00f3, Elisenda","Mora, Marta","Navarro, Ferran","Oliver, Antonio","Pascual, \u00c1lvaro","Rodr\u00edguez-Ba\u00f1o, Jes\u00fas","Ruiz-Carrascoso, Guillermo","Ruiz-Garbajosa, Patricia","Zamorano, Laura","Bautista, Ver\u00f3nica","P\u00e9rez-V\u00e1zquez, Mar\u00eda","Campos, Jos\u00e9",", "],"doi":"10.1128\/aac.00086-15","first_seen_on":"2016-02-19T06:40:49+00:00","issns":["1098-6596"],"journal":"Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1455864006,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25824224?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25824224","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["drugtherapy"],"title":"Prospective multicenter study of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae from 83 hospitals in Spain reveals high in vitro susceptibility to coli..","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prospective-multicenter-study-carbapenemaseproducing-enterobacteriaceae-83-hospitals-spain-reveals-h"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7214390,"mean":6.3538386288811,"rank":5430462,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":993346,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7214390,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283780,"mean":10.33367807343,"rank":198441,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":45733,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283780,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5193,"mean":6.631561248074,"rank":4100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":652,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5193,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268,"mean":11.460404494382,"rank":254,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Ph.
