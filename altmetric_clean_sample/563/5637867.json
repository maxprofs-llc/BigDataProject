HS-AFM avoids amplification artifacts present in PCR or in the sequencing of amplified products, it requires no chemical labels, and easily achieves near-single-molecule sensitivity. Using this technique, we found trace levels of filamentous contamination, similar in appearance to dsDNA, in eluates from the Zymo, Qiagen and ChargeSwitch kits. Conversely, we detected no contaminants in magnetic bead-based AMPure XP solutions. Eluates from the Zymo kits also tested positive for DNA in fluorescent intercalator dye and whole genome amplification (WGA) assays. Qiagen kits tested positive in the fluorescence assay but negative in the WGA assay. Both ChargeSwitch and AMPure XP tested negative in the fluorescence assay while the WGA results for these two kits were ambiguous. Taken together, our findings suggest AMPure XP would be the best choice for analyses requiring very high analytical stringency. While HS-AFM alone does not provide chemical specificity, it is a potentially valuable tool for characterizing and quantifying trace contaminants in molecular biology reagents and instruments in cases where conventional techniques fail.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224e","authors":["Andrey Mikheikin"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.analchem.5b04023","first_seen_on":"2016-02-19T11:44:25+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci","nigms"],"issns":["1520-6882"],"journal":"Analytical Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1455882242,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.analchem.5b04023"],"pmid":"26878668","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"High-speed AFM reveals contamination in DNA purification systems","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highspeed-atomic-force-microscopy-revealing-contamination-dna-purification-systems"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7214390,"mean":6.3538386288811,"rank":3646251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2050592,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7214390,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283780,"mean":10.333742384038,"rank":152367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":101745,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283780,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6714,"mean":3.3442201698197,"rank":3280,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":2659,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6714,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161,"mean":12.0407375,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":64,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
