Most pancreatic tumors, however, develop resistance to gemcitabine. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), a critical regulator in many cell cycle events, is significantly elevated in human pancreatic cancer. In this study, we show that Plk1 is required for the G1\/S transition and that inhibition of Plk1 significantly reduces the DNA synthesis rate in human pancreatic cancer cells. Furthermore, the combined effect of a specific Plk1 inhibitor GSK461364A with gemcitabine was examined. We show that inhibition of Plk1 significantly potentiates the anti-neoplastic activity of gemcitabine in both cultured pancreatic cancer cells and Panc1-derived orthotopic pancreatic cancer xenograft tumors. Overall, our study demonstrates that co-targeting Plk1 can significantly enhance the efficacy of gemcitabine, offering a promising new therapeutic option for the treatment of gemcitabine-resistant human pancreatic cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e17","authors":["Li, Jie","Wang, Ruixin","Schweickert, Patrick G","Karki, Anju","Yang, Yi","Kong, Yifan","Ahmad, Nihal","Konieczny, Stephen F","Liu, Xiaoqi"],"doi":"10.1080\/15384101.2016.1148838","first_seen_on":"2016-02-19T11:01:42+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci","niams"],"issns":["1551-4005"],"journal":"Cell Cycle","last_mentioned_on":1455879656,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26890815?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26890815","pubdate":"2016-02-19T22:00:19+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Plk1 Inhibition Enhances the Efficacy of Gemcitabine in Human Pancreatic Cancer.  - PubMed - NCBI","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/plk1-inhibition-enhances-efficacy-gemcitabine-human-pancreatic-cancer-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7214390,"mean":6.3538386288811,"rank":5430468,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":993320,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7214390,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283779,"mean":10.333710259428,"rank":198446,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":45719,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283779,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2019,"mean":2.4933954410307,"rank":1196,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":447,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2019,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82,"mean":5.3007160493827,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
