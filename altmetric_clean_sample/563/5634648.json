(Sept. 17 issue)(1) report on the results of the Treatment of Sleep-Disordered Breathing with Predominant Central Sleep Apnea by Adaptive Servo Ventilation in Patients with Heart Failure (SERVE-HF) trial. They found increases in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality among patients with heart failure who received adaptive servo-ventilation therapy, and the adaptive servo-ventilation group had no improvement in quality-of-life measures.
