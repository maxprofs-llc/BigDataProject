Health-improving workplace environment was measured using the Japanese version of the Environmental Assessment Tool. Physical activity, self-efficacy, and psychological distress were also measured. Multi-level structural equation modeling was used to investigate the moderating effect of health-improving workplace environment on relationships between psychological distress, self-efficacy, and physical activity.\nPsychological distress was negatively associated with physical activity via low self-efficacy. Physical activity was negatively related to psychological distress. Physical activity\/fitness facilities in the work environment exaggerated the positive relationship between self-efficacy and physical activity.\nPhysical activity\/fitness facilities in the workplace may promote employees' physical activity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e91","authors":["Watanabe, Kazuhiro","Otsuka, Yasumasa","Shimazu, Akihito","Kawakami, Norito"],"doi":"10.1097\/jom.0000000000000590","first_seen_on":"2016-02-19T04:49:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1536-5948","1076-2752"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Occupational & Environmental Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1455857354,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/joem\/Abstract\/2016\/02000\/The_Moderating_Effect_of_Health_Improving.11.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/joem\/2016\/02000\/The_Moderating_Effect_of_Health_Improving.11.pdf","pmid":"26849262","pubdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"178","subjects":["environmentalhealth","occupationalmedicine"],"title":"The Moderating Effect of Health-Improving Workplace Environment on Promoting Physical Activity in White-Collar Employees:  A Multi-Site Longitudinal Study Using Multi-Level Structural Equation Modeling","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/joem\/Fulltext\/2016\/02000\/The_Moderating_Effect_of_Health_Improving.11.aspx","volume":"58","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/moderating-effect-healthimproving-workplace-environment-promoting-physical-activity-whitecollar-empl"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7214390,"mean":6.3538386288811,"rank":5430461,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":993350,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7214390,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283779,"mean":10.333721712042,"rank":198440,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":45730,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283779,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2445,"mean":5.5031914893617,"rank":1765,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2445,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":10.492213333333,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
