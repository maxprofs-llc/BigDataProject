We aim to investigate cross-sectional and longitudinal effects of daily energy intake (EI) on BMI z-scores of European boys and girls considering growth-related height dependencies of EI using residual EI.\nTo investigate cross-sectional and longitudinal effects of daily energy intake (EI) on BMI z-scores of European boys and girls considering growth-related height dependencies of EI using residual EI.\nSubjects were children aged 2-\u2009<\u200910 y old (N\u2009=\u20092753, 48.2\u00a0% girls) participating in the IDEFICS (Identification and prevention of Dietary- and lifestyle-induced health EFfects In Children and infantS) baseline and follow-up examination. Usual EI (kcal\/day) was calculated based on the National Cancer Institute-method excluding subjects with implausible reported EI. Effect of age, height and sex-adjusted residuals of EI on BMI z-score was investigated stratified by baseline age -group (2-\u2009<\u20094 y, 4-\u2009<\u20096 y, 6-\u2009<\u20098 y and 8-\u2009<\u200910 y) cross-sectionally using linear regression models adjusted for relevant confounders (crude model: age, sex, country; fully adjusted model: plus parental ISCED level, parental BMI, screen time; subgroup analysis: plus objectively measured physical activity). Longitudinal associations were estimated between changes in (\u0394) residual EI per year and \u0394BMI z-score per year with adjustments analogously to the cross-sectional models but with additional adjustment for residual EI at baseline.\nCross-sectionally, positive associations were observed between residual EI and BMI z-score for the full study sample, for boys and in older (\u22656\u00a0years) but not in younger children in the crude and fully adjusted model. Longitudinally, small positive associations were observed between \u0394residual EI per y on \u0394BMI z-score per y for the full study sample and in 4-\u2009<\u20096 y olds in the crude and fully adjusted model.\nIn conclusion, EI above the average intakes for a certain sex, age and height are weakly associated with BMI z-scores in European children. Residual EI may be considered as a useful exposure measure in children as it accounts for growth-related changes in usual EI during childhood.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000839","authors":["Antje Hebestreit","Gianvincenzo Barba","Stefaan De Henauw","Gabriele Eiben","Charalampos Hadjigeorgiou","\u00c9va Kov\u00e1cs","Vittorio Krogh","Luis A.
