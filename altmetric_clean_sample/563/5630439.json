Nasal NKTCL is a rare but serious type of systemic lymphoma because of its high mortality rate and serious complications. In this case report, we describe a male who presented with nasal blockage in the right side, a fever of one month duration and a soy-like, painless and gradually increasing mass in the right submandibular region due to nasal NKTCL. The patient had no significant medical history and the initial clinical symptoms were nasal blockage. Contrast computed tomography showed that the nasopharyngeal mucosa was thickened and that the celiac and retroperitoneal lymphaden was intumescent. Finally a biopsy, guided by nasal endoscopy and examined using flow cytometry confirmed a diagnosis of NKTCL. Nasal NKTCL is rare and has no unique characteristics at first presentation, such as epidemiology and obvious clinical manifestation. As no effective therapy is currently available for this disease, early diagnosis and therapy of nasal NKTCL remains challenging.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Zou, Hai","Pan, Ke-Hua","Wu, Liang","Pan, Hong-Ying","Ding, Ya-Hui","Zheng, Ming-Hua"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.7386","first_seen_on":"2016-02-18T12:39:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"issue":"8","journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1455903084,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26885897?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC4891064","pmid":"26885897","pubdate":"2016-02-18T22:00:40+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Nasal NK\/T cell lymphoma presents with long-term nasal blockage and fever: a rare case report and literature review","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nasal-nkt-cell-lymphoma-presents-longterm-nasal-blockage-fever-rare-case-report-literature-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7214390,"mean":6.3538386288811,"rank":3214178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3838121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7214390,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283249,"mean":10.31481079478,"rank":126972,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":146611,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283249,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6568,"mean":2.6911432922187,"rank":1278,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":4982,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6568,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":591,"mean":1.4820033898305,"rank":109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":440,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":591,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NK_papers\/statuses\/700290635648147456","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5630439],"posted_on":"2016-02-18T12:07:52+00:00","author":{"name":"NK papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/573591369375031296\/MLLMIFLv_normal.png","description":"Paper Twitterbot for academics with an interest in NK cell biology.","id_on_source":"NK_papers","tweeter_id":"2369366659","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":228},"tweet_id":"700290635648147456"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/mistlavcarrillo\/statuses\/700734434920652801","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5630439],"posted_on":"2016-02-19T17:31:22+00:00","author":{"name":"Mistlav Carrillo","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_2_normal.png","id_on_source":"mistlavcarrillo","tweeter_id":"23142751","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":113},"tweet_id":"700734434920652801"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/travismarcal\/statuses\/700734439848947712","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5630439],"posted_on":"2016-02-19T17:31:24+00:00","author":{"name":"Travis Marcal","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_5_normal.png","id_on_source":"travismarcal","tweeter_id":"23523288","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":534},"tweet_id":"700734439848947712"}]}}
