In other cases such as extracellular sensing, cellular uptake should be effectively inhibited. Self-assembly of molecular probes into supramo-lecular nanoprobes presents a potential strategy to alter their interaction mechanisms with cells to promote or reduce their cellular uptake. Here we report on the design, synthesis and assembly of peptide-based molecular beacons into supramolecular protease sensors of either spherical or filamentous shapes. We found that positively charged spherical nanobeacons demonstrate much high-er cellular uptake efficiency than its monomeric form, thus making them most suitable for intracellular sensing of the lysosomal protease cathepsin B. Our results also suggest that assembly into filamentous nanobeacons significantly reduces their internaliza-tion by cancer cells, an important property that can be utilized for probing extracellular protease activities. These studies provide important guiding principles for rational design of supramolecular nanoprobes with tunable cellular uptake characteristics.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Lock, Lye Lin","Reyes, Claudia","Zhang, Pengcheng","Cui, Honggang","Lye Lin Lock"],"doi":"10.1021\/jacs.6b00073","first_seen_on":"2016-02-19T11:43:30+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1520-5126","0002-7863"],"issue":"10","journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1458747004,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26890853?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jacs.6b00073"],"pmid":"26890853","pubdate":"2016-02-19T22:00:18+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Tuning Cellular Uptake of Molecular Probes by Rational Design of Their Assembly into Supramolecular Nanoprobes.  - PubMed - NCBI","type":"article","volume":"138","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tuning-cellular-uptake-molecular-probes-rational-design-assembly-supramolecular-nanoprobes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7430207,"mean":6.4614621922959,"rank":3276770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4080621,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7430207,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284939,"mean":10.402553909973,"rank":121617,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":158416,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284939,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17943,"mean":5.0066166536618,"rank":10857,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":6909,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17943,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":407,"mean":7.5686748768473,"rank":225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":407,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
