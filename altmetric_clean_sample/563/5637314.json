We sought to evaluate hemorheology and its relationship to hemodynamics in children with univentricular hearts. We hypothesized that low-shear blood viscosity and red blood cell (RBC) aggregation would be associated with increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and decreased pulmonary blood flow (PBF). We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 62 children undergoing cardiac catheterization-20 with isolated atrial septal defect (ASD), 22 status post Glenn procedure (Glenn), and 20 status post Fontan procedure (Fontan). Shear-dependent blood viscosity, RBC aggregation and deformability, complete blood count, coagulation panel, metabolic panel, fibrinogen, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were measured. PVR and PBF were calculated using the Fick equation. Group differences were analyzed by ANOVA and correlations by linear regression. Blood viscosity at all shear rates was higher in Glenn and Fontan, partially due to normocytic anemia in ASD. RBC aggregation and deformability were similar between all groups. Low-shear viscosity negatively correlated with PBF in Glenn and Fontan only (R (2)\u00a0=\u00a00.27, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001); it also negatively correlated with pulmonary artery pressure in Glenn (R (2)\u00a0=\u00a00.15, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01), and positively correlated with PVR in Fontan (R (2)\u00a0=\u00a00.28, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Our data demonstrate that elevated low-shear blood viscosity is associated with negative hemodynamic perturbations in a passive univentricular pulmonary circulation, but not in a pulsatile biventricular pulmonary circulation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032aa","authors":["Cheng, Andrew L","Takao, Cheryl M","Wenby, Rosalinda B","Meiselman, Herbert J","Wood, John C","Detterich, Jon A"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00246-016-1352-4","first_seen_on":"2016-02-19T11:05:50+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["1432-1971"],"journal":"Pediatric Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1455880718,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26888364?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26888364?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26888364","pubdate":"2016-02-19T22:01:14+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics","cardiology"],"title":"Elevated Low-Shear Blood Viscosity is Associated with Decreased Pulmonary Blood Flow in Children with Univentricular Heart Defects","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/elevated-lowshear-blood-viscosity-associated-decreased-pulmonary-blood-flow-children-univentricular"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7214390,"mean":6.3538386288811,"rank":5174929,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1783915,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7214390,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283779,"mean":10.333727702641,"rank":182251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":85331,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283779,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":708,"mean":1.0275388967468,"rank":210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":462,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":708,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":0.61142857142857,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
