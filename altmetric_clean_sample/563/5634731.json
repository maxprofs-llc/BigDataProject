Allergy immunotherapy constitutes a complementary treatment option targeting the underlying immunological mechanisms of allergic disease and represents the only treatment with a potential for disease modification and long-term efficacy. As traditional allergy immunotherapy delivered by subcutaneous injection of specific HDM allergens involves a time-consuming treatment regimen and a risk of systemic adverse reactions, sublingually administered allergy immunotherapy (SLIT) has been investigated as a more convenient treatment option with similar levels of efficacy and an improved safety profile that allows for at-home daily administration. In this Drug Profile, we provide a review of the clinical data behind the SQ HDM SLIT-tablet, which was recently approved for the treatment of HDM-induced allergic rhinitis by regulatory authorities in Europe and Japan.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073cd","authors":["Ludger Klimek"],"doi":"10.1586\/1744666x.2016.1144473","first_seen_on":"2016-02-19T00:09:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1744-8409"],"journal":"Expert Review of Clinical Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1455840570,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1586\/1744666X.2016.1144473?ai=1lf9k&mi=ianpxd&af=R"],"pmid":"26788764","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"SQ house dust mite (HDM) SLIT-tablet provides clinical improvement in HDM-induced allergic rhinitis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sq-house-dust-mite-hdm-slittablet-provides-clinical-improvement-hdminduced-allergic-rhinitis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7214390,"mean":6.3538386288811,"rank":6221012,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7214390,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283780,"mean":10.333675606722,"rank":238040,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283780,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":501,"mean":2.430136,"rank":350,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":501,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":2.0632352941176,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ERJournals\/statuses\/700472239167176704","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5634731],"posted_on":"2016-02-19T00:09:30+00:00","author":{"name":"Expert Reviews","url":"http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/page\/ExpertReviews","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000496751182\/2258702d67dd42cedd317fb79fc5212a_normal.jpeg","description":"Expert Reviews is a leading series of 16 journals providing commentary and analysis on modern healthcare","id_on_source":"ERJournals","tweeter_id":"1886949961","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1285},"tweet_id":"700472239167176704"}]}}
