Management options are limited to lifestyle modifications, highlighting the need for alternative therapeutic options. The objective of this study was to examine if fermented Fuzhuan tea prevents metabolic impairments associated with development of hepatic steatosis.\nRats consumed control (CON) or high saturated fat (SAT) diets with or without Fuzhuan tea for 8 weeks. Outcomes included enzymatic and gene expression measures of metabolic dysregulation in liver and adipose tissue. Pyrosequencing was used to assess intestinal microbiota adaptations. Fuzhuan tea prevented diet-induced inflammation in the liver. Liver triglycerides of \u223c18 mg\/g were observed in SAT-fed animals, but remained similar to CON diet levels (\u223c12 mg\/g) when supplemented with Fuzhuan tea. In adipose tissue, tea treatment prevented SAT-induced inflammation and reduced plasma leptin \u223c2-fold. Fuzhuan tea also altered intestinal function and was associated with 3-fold increases in two Lactobacillus spp.\nThese data suggest Fuzhuan tea protects against liver and adipose tissue stress induced by a high saturated fat diet and positively influences intestinal function. Further investigation of the molecular targets of Fuzhuan tea is warranted. This article is protected by copyright.
