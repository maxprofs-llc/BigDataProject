Many genes associated with the dopamine and norepinephrine systems are related to the cognitive deficits of patients with schizophrenia. Dopamine \u03b2-hydroxylase (D\u03b2H) is a key enzyme that converts dopamine to norepinephrine and for which activity and levels are under strong genetic control.\nTo examine whether the D\u03b2H 5'-insertion\/deletion (Ins\/Del) polymorphism influences cognitive function in patients with chronic schizophrenia.\nThe presence of the D\u03b2H 5'-Ins\/Del polymorphism was determined in 733 patients with chronic schizophrenia (diagnosed according to DSM-IV) and 544 healthy controls using a case-control design. We assessed all of the patients' psychopathology using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and cognition in 540 patients with chronic schizophrenia and 297 healthy controls using the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). This study was conducted between 2008 and 2011.\nThe allelic and genotypic frequencies of the D\u03b2H 5'-Ins\/Del polymorphism were not significantly different between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls (both P values > .05). However, the cognitive test scores were significantly lower in patients than in the healthy controls for all scales (all P values < .05), except visuospatial\/constructional (P > .05). The attention score significantly differed according to the genotypic group (P < .05) in patients but not in the healthy controls (P > .05). In patients with chronic schizophrenia, the mean \u00b1 SD attention score was lower in the D\u03b2H 5'-Del\/Del genotype (65.7 \u00b1 16.8) than in the D\u03b2H 5'-Ins\/Del genotype (71.4 \u00b1 18.0; P = .007) and the D\u03b2H 5'-Ins\/Ins genotype (70.8 \u00b1 17.1; P = .02).\nThis study found that patients with chronic schizophrenia had poorer cognitive function than the healthy controls in all examined cognitive domains except for visuospatial\/constructional. No significant association was found between the D\u03b2H 5'-Ins\/Del polymorphism and patients with chronic schizophrenia. However, the D\u03b2H 5'-Del\/Del genotype may be specific to attentional decrements in patients with chronic schizophrenia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bee","authors":["Hui, Li","Han, Mei","Huang, Xu Feng","Ye, Min Jie","Zhang, Xuan","He, Jin Cai","Lv, Meng Han","Soares, Jair C","Zhang, Xiang Yang","\r\n\t\tLi Hui\r\n\t\t","\r\n\t\tMei Han\r\n\t\t","\r\n\t\tXu Feng Huang\r\n\t\t","\r\n\t\tMin Jie Ye\r\n\t\t","\r\n\t\tXuan Zhang\r\n\t\t","\r\n\t\tJin Cai He\r\n\t\t","\r\n\t\tMeng Han Lv\r\n\t\t","\r\n\t\tJair C.
