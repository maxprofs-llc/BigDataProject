Angle closure is caused by appositional approximation or adhesion between the iris and the trabecular meshwork. The main treatment strategy for PACG lies in the reduction of intraocular pressure, reopening of the closed angle, and possible prevention of further angle closure. There is no universally agreed best surgical treatment for PACG. Trabeculectomy, goniosynechialysis (GSL), glaucoma implant, and cyclodestructive procedures are effective surgical options. Each of them plays an important role in the management of PACG with its own pros and cons. Accumulating evidence is available to show the effectiveness of visually significant and visually nonsignificant cataract extraction in the treatment of PACG. Trabeculectomy and GSL are often combined with cataract extraction, which may offer additional pressure control benefits to patients with PACG. This review article will discuss laser peripheral iridotomy, argon laser peripheral iridoplasty, and surgeries such as GSL, phacoemulsification, and phaco plus glaucoma surgeries that lower intraocular pressure and also alter the anterior segment and\/or drainage angle anatomy. Currently, glaucoma implants and cyclodestruction are mainly reserved for PACG patients who have failed previous filtering operations. Their role as initial surgical treatment for PACG will not be discussed.","altmetric_jid":"5523eeb12a83ee005f8b4571","authors":["Lai, Jimmy","Choy, Bonnie N K","Shum, Jennifer W H"],"doi":"10.1097\/apo.0000000000000180","first_seen_on":"2016-02-18T15:03:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2162-0989"],"issue":"1","journal":"Asia Pacific Journal of Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1455803438,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26886121?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26886121","pubdate":"2016-02-18T22:00:27+00:00","title":"Management of Primary Angle-Closure Glaucoma.  - PubMed - NCBI","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/management-primary-angleclosure-glaucoma-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7211484,"mean":6.3513465940328,"rank":6218323,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7211484,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283223,"mean":10.314038697559,"rank":237460,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283223,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":1.2271506849315,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.1071428571429,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
