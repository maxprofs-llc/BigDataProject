Since NAVA uses the diaphragm electrical activity (Edi) as the controller signal, it is possible to deliver synchronized non-invasive NAVA (NIV-NAVA) regardless of leaks and to monitor continuously patient respiratory pattern and drive. Advantages of NIV-NAVA over conventional modes include improved patient-ventilator interaction, reliable respiratory monitoring and self-regulation of respiratory support. In theory, these characteristics make NIV-NAVA an ideal mode to provide effective, appropriate non-invasive support to newborns with respiratory insufficiency. NIV-NAVA has been successfully used clinically in neonates as a mode of ventilation to prevent intubation, to allow early extubation, and as a novel way to deliver nasal continuous positive airway pressure. The use of NAVA in neonates is described with an emphasis on studies and clinical experience with NIV-NAVA.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f6100088f5","authors":["Howard Stein","Jennifer Beck","Michael Dunn"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.siny.2016.01.006","first_seen_on":"2016-02-18T21:05:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1744-165X","1878-0946"],"journal":"Seminars in Fetal and Neonatal Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1455832229,"links":["http:\/\/www.sfnmjournal.com\/article\/S1744-165X(16)00016-0\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.sfnmjournal.com\/article\/S1744165X16000160\/pdf","pmid":"26899957","pubdate":"2016-02-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["perinatology","pediatrics"],"title":"Non-invasive ventilation with neurally adjusted ventilatory assist in newborns","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/noninvasive-ventilation-neurally-adjusted-ventilatory-assist-newborns"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7211484,"mean":6.3513465940328,"rank":5428166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":993108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7211484,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283223,"mean":10.314147269633,"rank":198011,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":45694,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283223,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":198,"mean":3.2694314720812,"rank":125,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":198,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":2.1610526315789,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
