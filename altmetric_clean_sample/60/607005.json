We find large and reproducible shifts in the charge neutrality point of GraFETs that are dependent on the liquid velocity and the ion concentration. We show that these shifts are consistent with the variation of the local electrochemical potential of the liquid next to graphene that are caused by the fluid flow (streaming potential). Furthermore, we utilize the sensitivity of electrical transport in GraFETs to the parameters of the fluid flow to demonstrate graphene-based mass flow and ionic concentration sensing. We successfully detect a flow as small as \u223c70 nL\/min and detect a change in the ionic concentration as small as \u223c40 nM.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012arXiv1202.3382N","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003145","arxiv_id":"1202.3382","authors":["A.
