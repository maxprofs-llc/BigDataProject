In horses, there is increasing evidence for Equus caballus papillomavirus type 2 (EcPV-2) being causally involved in SCC development. However, only little is known regarding intralesional transcription of the virus, and sparse information on the incidence of EcPV-2 infection in healthy equids is available so far. Using RT-PCR, total mRNA from 8 EcPV-2 DNA-positive and 1 EcPV-2 negative SCC\/SCC precursor lesions was screened for the presence of EcPV-2 E6 and E1 transcripts. Using PCR, we tested 193 sample specimens (30 ocular swabs, 94 genital swabs, 54 semen and 15 milk samples) from a total of 161 apparently healthy horses for the presence of EcPV-2 genes E7 and E6 or E2. Positive results were confirmed by repeating the PCR reactions, and by amplicon sequencing. E6 mRNA was detectable in 8\/8 EcPV-2 DNA-positive lesions, whereas only 3\/8 scored positive for E1 mRNA. EcPV-2 PCR scored positive for DNA from 1\/30 ocular swabs, 4\/94 genital swabs, 0\/54 semen and 0\/15 milk samples, thus resulting in an overall detection rate of 5\/193, i.e. 2.6%. The demonstrated presence of viral mRNA in all EcPV-2 DNA-positive lesions is suggestive for an active pathogenic role of the virus in SCC development. This finding and the low incidence of EcPV-2 DNA in healthy equids further strengthen the concept of an aetiologic association of EcPV-2 with equine SCC disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036fb","authors":["Sabine Sykora","Lisa Samek","Katharina Sch\u00f6nthaler","Franziska Palm","Giuseppe Borzacchiello","Christine Aurich","Sabine Brandt"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.vetmic.2012.02.006","first_seen_on":"2012-02-15T14:35:48+00:00","issns":["03781135"],"journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1329315572,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSCONTENT&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0378113512001162&_version=1&md5=ed55e4baaa6367a5301674397370ec2c&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"22386674","pubdate":"2012-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"EcPV-2 is transcriptionally active in equine SCC but only rarely detectable in swabs and semen from healthy horses","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ecpv2-transcriptionally-active-equine-scc-only-rarely-detectable-swabs-semen-healthy-horses"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506051,"mean":5.113311188876,"rank":3111483,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1004157,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506051,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234300,"mean":4.2736043346325,"rank":148510,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":56826,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234300,"percentile":24},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":909,"mean":1.8835616740088,"rank":621,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":909,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":1.3905405405405,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/nathanvoris\/status\/169787934021652480","citation_ids":[605805],"posted_on":"2012-02-15T14:19:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Nathan Voris","url":"http:\/\/www.nathanvoris.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/68346256\/DSC_4446_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"nathanvoris","tweeter_id":"18190395","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":149},"tweet_id":"169787934021652480"}]}}
