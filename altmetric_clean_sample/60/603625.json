Biocatalysis is a field of science that operates at the crossroads of organic chemistry, biochemistry, microbiology, and molecular biology, and provides an excellent model for interdisciplinary research. We have developed an inquiry-based module that uses the mutagenesis of the yeast reductase, YDL124w, to study the bioorganic synthesis of the taxol side-chain, a pharmacologically important molecule. Using related structures, students identify regions they think will affect enzyme stereoselective, design and generate site-specific mutants, and then characterize the effect of these changes on enzyme activity. This laboratory activity gives our students experience, working in a scientific discipline outside of biology and exposes them to techniques and equipment they do not normally work with in a molecular biology course. These inter-disciplinary experiences not only show the relevance of other sciences to biology, but also give our students the ability to communicate more effectively with scientists outside their discipline.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fe3cf058f61000611e","authors":["Beers, Mande","Archer, Crystal","Feske, Brent D.","Mateer, Scott C."],"doi":"10.1002\/bmb.20578","endpage":"137","first_seen_on":"2012-02-14T12:18:14+00:00","issns":["1539-3429","1470-8175"],"issue":"2","journal":"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology Education","last_mentioned_on":1329221164,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/bmb.20578"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/bmb.20578\/pdf","pmid":"22419594","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"130","subjects":["molecularbiology","education","biochemistry"],"title":"Using biocatalysis to integrate organic chemistry into a molecular biology laboratory course","type":"article","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/using-biocatalysis-integrate-organic-chemistry-molecular-biology-laboratory-course-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6384136,"mean":5.9830488738098,"rank":4718990,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":948144,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6384136,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239883,"mean":4.7779269057288,"rank":152438,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":43610,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239883,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":221,"mean":2.1816272727273,"rank":137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":221,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":1.137037037037,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/iubmbwiley\/status\/169391957574037504","citation_ids":[603625],"posted_on":"2012-02-14T12:06:04+00:00","author":{"name":"IUBMB@Wiley","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1562771946\/logo_IUBMB-twittersize_normal.gif","description":"The latest updates and discussion on journals and books published for the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology by Wiley-Blackwell","id_on_source":"iubmbwiley","tweeter_id":"381085986","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":32},"tweet_id":"169391957574037504"}]}}
