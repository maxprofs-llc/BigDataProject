It has been taken as a reference the methodology of Work Ergonomic Analysis-WEA. 21 fishermen participated in the study (50% of the population). It was used applying observational techniques and methodologies (open and sistematic observations and simulations) interactional ( social and economic questionnaire, conversational actions, verbalizations, self confrontations and collective analysis) and health assessment (static postural assessment, movement flexibility of flexo extension of the shoulder and the ischiotibial muscle, lumbar region and hang grip. Applying the diagram of painful areas and the Nordic Questionnaire of mucleskeletal symptoms). The results were submeted to restitutions and validations with the raftmen. The hauling of the nets represents a high muscleskeletal risk, joining physical effort, adopting forced postures with the rotation of the spine and movement repetition, mainly flexo extension of vertebral spine, aggravated by the demand of strength fo the stabilizing muscles of the human body to keep the poise. The impacts of the activity of the fisherman of Ponta Negra, related to postures and strength demand were observed in the postural assessment and are related to the activity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5683cf058f610004ae1","authors":["Jaeschke A","Saldanha MC"],"doi":"10.3233\/wor-2012-0191-414","first_seen_on":"2012-02-14T19:40:24+00:00","issns":["1051-9815"],"issue":"0","journal":"Work","last_mentioned_on":1329247532,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22316760?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22316760","pubdate":"2012-02-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mechanical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["occupationalmedicine"],"title":"Physical demands during the hauling of fishing nets for artisan fishing using rafts in beach of Ponta Negra, Natal-Brasil.","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/physical-demands-during-hauling-fishing-nets-artisan-fishing-using-rafts-beach-ponta-negra-natalbras"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506051,"mean":5.113311188876,"rank":3111529,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1004835,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506051,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234174,"mean":4.271609382807,"rank":148333,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":56879,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234174,"percentile":24},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":312,"mean":2.6130610932476,"rank":210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":73,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":312,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":1.9749444444444,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
