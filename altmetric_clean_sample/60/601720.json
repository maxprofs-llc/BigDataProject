The aim of this study is to analyze the sleep-wake cycle and perceived sleepiness of working college students during weekdays. Twenty-three healthy college male students, 21-24 years old, working during the day and attending classes in the evening, participated in this study. During five consecutive days, the students filled out daily activities logs and wore actigraphs. Mean sleeping time was lower than 6 hours per night. No significant differences were observed in the sleep-wake cycle during the weekdays. The observed lack of changes in the sleepwake cycle of these college students might occur as participants were not on a free schedule, but exposed to social constraints, as was the regular attendance to evening college and day work activities. Sleepiness worsened over the evening school hours. Those results show the burden carried by College students who perform double activities - work and study.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5683cf058f610004ae1","authors":["Teixeira L","Lowden A","da Luz AA","Turte SL","Valente D","Matsumura RJ","de Paula LP","Takara MY","Nagai-Manelli R","Fischer FM"],"doi":"10.3233\/wor-2012-0879-5550","first_seen_on":"2012-02-13T18:43:15+00:00","issns":["1051-9815"],"issue":"0","journal":"Work","last_mentioned_on":1329158107,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22317611"],"pmid":"22317611","pubdate":"2012-02-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mechanical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["occupationalmedicine"],"title":"Sleep patterns and sleepiness of working college students.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/urn.kb.se\/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:su:diva-81688","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sleep-patterns-sleepiness-working-college-students"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506977,"mean":5.1265981649798,"rank":3084197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":968559,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506977,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234126,"mean":4.3055725872934,"rank":147437,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":50178,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234126,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":312,"mean":2.6243151125402,"rank":208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":68,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":312,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":2.0096666666667,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
