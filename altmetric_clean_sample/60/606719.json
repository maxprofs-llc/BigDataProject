N-cadherin, a crucial mediator of homotypic and heterotypic cell-cell interactions, might play a central role in the metastasis of neuroblastoma (NB), a solid tumor of neuroectodermal origin. Using Reverse Transcription Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), Western blot, immunocytochemistry and Tissue MicroArrays (TMA) we demonstrate the expression of N-cadherin in neuroblastoma tumors and cell lines. All neuroblastic tumors (n\u200a=\u200a356) and cell lines (n\u200a=\u200a10) expressed various levels of the adhesion protein. The N-cadherin mRNA expression was significantly lower in tumor samples from patients suffering metastatic disease. Treatment of NB cell lines with the N-cadherin blocking peptide ADH-1 (Exherin, Adherex Technologies Inc.), strongly inhibited tumor cell proliferation in vitro by inducing apoptosis. Our results suggest that N-cadherin signaling may play a role in neuroblastoma disease, marking involvement of metastasis and determining neuroblastoma cell viability.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012PLoSO...7E1206L","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Tim Lammens","Katrien Swerts","Lara Derycke","Annemie De Craemer","Sara De Brouwer","Katleen De Preter","Nadine Van Roy","Jo Vandesompele","Frank Speleman","Jan Philipp\u00e9","Yves Benoit","Klaus Beiske","Marc Bracke","Genevi\u00e8ve Laureys","Lammens T","Swerts K","Derycke L","De Craemer A","De Brouwer S","De Preter K","Van Roy N","Vandesompele J","Speleman F","Philipp\u00e9 J","Benoit Y","Beiske K","Bracke M","Laureys G","Olivier de Wever"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0031206","first_seen_on":"2012-02-15T23:14:58+00:00","handle":"1854\/LU-2127317","handles":["1854\/LU-2127317"],"issns":["1932-6203",""],"issue":"2","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1329346451,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0031206","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0031206"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0031206.pdf","pmid":"22355346","pubdate":"2012-02-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e31206","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"N-Cadherin in Neuroblastoma Disease: Expression and Clinical Significance","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0031206","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ncadherin-neuroblastoma-disease-expression-clinical-significance"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627150,"mean":4.9502167410311,"rank":2906814,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":73541,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627150,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230881,"mean":4.0313144404021,"rank":168344,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":433,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230881,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64064,"mean":8.3129482228432,"rank":50349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64064,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4174,"mean":5.5939127725857,"rank":2921,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4174,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
