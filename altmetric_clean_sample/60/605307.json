The article examines Catholic nurses' work with African Americans in the mid-20th century that took place amid the prevailing social conditions of poverty and racial disempowerment, conditions that were linked to serious health consequences. Historical methodology is used within the framework of \"bearing witness,\" a term often used in relation to the civil rights movement and one the sisters themselves employed. Two situations involving nurses in the mid-20th century are examined: the civil rights movement in Selma, Alabama, and the actions for racial justice in Chicago, Illinois. The thoughts and actions of Catholic sister and brother nurses in the mid-20th century are chronicled, including those few sister nurses who stepped outside their ordinary roles in an attempt to change an unjust system entirely.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f6100056d2","authors":["Barbra Mann Wall"],"doi":"10.1097\/ans.0b013e3181a3d741","first_seen_on":"2012-02-15T08:39:14+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"2","journal":"Advances in Nursing Science","last_mentioned_on":1329294002,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2743075\/?tool=pmcentrez"],"pmcid":"PMC2743075","pmid":"19461224","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher":"NIH Public Access","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"E81","subjects":["nursing"],"title":"Catholic Nursing Sisters and Brothers and Racial Justice in Mid-20th-Century America","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/catholic-nursing-sisters-brothers-racial-justice-mid20thcentury-america"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":4207694,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237723,"mean":4.5677652972803,"rank":194700,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237723,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":198,"mean":1.2799898477157,"rank":143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":198,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.8204545454545,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Sports and Recreations":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/Why_We_Do_That\/status\/169697464029421568","citation_ids":[605307],"posted_on":"2012-02-15T08:20:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Why_We_Do_That","url":"http:\/\/hiv-insight.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/779459146\/Rorschach_4_normal.jpg","description":"Psychology; how, why & what not.
