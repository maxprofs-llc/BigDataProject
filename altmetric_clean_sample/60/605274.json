We investigated the distribution of Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale scores, a measure of the degree of stress, in workplaces. We found that the degree of stress people experience when around other highly stressed people tends to be low, and vice versa. A simulation based on a model describing microlevel human-human interaction reproduced this observed phenomena and revealed that the energy state of a face-to-face communication network correlates with workplace stress macroscopically.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008518","authors":["Watanabe J","Akitomi T","Ara K","Yano K"],"first_seen_on":"2012-02-15T08:18:34+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Physical Review E: Statistical, Nonlinear, and Soft Matter Physics","last_mentioned_on":1329385478,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/21867344\/"],"pmid":"21867344","pubdate":"2011-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Mathematics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biophysics","physiology","statisticsastopic"],"title":"Antiferromagnetic character of workplace stress.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antiferromagnetic-character-workplace-stress"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629536,"mean":4.93415564694,"rank":1379838,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":2236547,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629536,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230914,"mean":4.0048868448293,"rank":54230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":175930,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230914,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506,"mean":1.6054992230855,"rank":687,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":3811,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":832,"mean":0.99478219013237,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":779,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":832,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
