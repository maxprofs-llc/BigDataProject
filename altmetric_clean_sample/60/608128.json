Alumina-coated iron oxide nanoparticles were synthesized and used as the solid support. The nanoparticles were functionalized with sodium dodecyl sulfate and used as adsorbents for solid phase extraction of the analyte. Extraction, elution, and detection procedures were performed sequentially in the sequential injection lab-on-valve (SI-LOV) system followed by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS). Mixtures of hydrophobic analytes were successfully extracted from solution using the synthesized magnetic adsorbents. The potential use of the established scheme was demonstrated by taking cobalt as a model analyte. Under the optimal conditions, the calibration curve showed an excellent linearity in the concentration range of 0.01-5 \u03bcg L(-1), and the relative standard deviation was 2.8% at the 0.5 \u03bcg L(-1) level (n=11). The limit of detection was 6 ng L(-1) with a sampling frequency of 18 h(-1). The present method has been successfully applied to cobalt determination in water samples and two certified reference materials.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002249","authors":["Yang Wang","Xiaoyu Luo","Jie Tang","Xiaoya Hu","Qin Xu","Chun Yang"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.aca.2011.11.022","endpage":"96","first_seen_on":"2012-02-16T19:50:41+00:00","issns":["00032670"],"journal":"Analytica Chimica Acta","last_mentioned_on":1329421321,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0003267011015030"],"pmid":"22200313","pubdate":"2012-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"92","title":"Extraction and preconcentration of trace levels of cobalt using functionalized magnetic nanoparticles in a sequential injection lab-on-valve system with detection by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry","type":"article","volume":"713","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/extraction-preconcentration-trace-levels-cobalt-using-functionalized-magnetic-nanoparticles-sequenti"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505992,"mean":5.1115236646191,"rank":3109237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1015228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505992,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79343,"mean":4.3926901262887,"rank":49735,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":21054,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79343,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1063,"mean":1.4120715630885,"rank":451,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":501,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1063,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":1.1491071428571,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
