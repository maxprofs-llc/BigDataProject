Sixteen outbreak-associated cases of measles were reported among US residents from seven states, with 9 additional cases resulting from subsequent transmission. The primary case was a track and field athlete from Argentina. Transmission occurred in three settings: the opening ceremonies in a domed stadium, track and field events, and first aid stations. Eight secondary cases had their only potential exposure at the opening ceremonies; 2 of these cases were unrelated spectators sitting in the same section of the upper deck > 30.5 m above the athlete's entrance. These findings demonstrate that the risk of indigenous measles transmission associated with international events in the United States must be considered, even in areas without recent measles activity. Moreover, the dynamic airborne transmission of measles illustrates the potential for transmission in the absence of a recognized exposure.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002df6","first_seen_on":"2012-02-13T18:58:18+00:00","issns":["0022-1899","1537-6613"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1423540949,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7876616","http:\/\/jid.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/171\/3\/679.short"],"pmid":"7876616","pubdate":"1995-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"An Outbreak Of Measles At An International Sporting Event With Airborne Transmission In A Domed Stadium","type":"article","volume":"171","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/outbreak-measles-international-sporting-event-airborne-transmission-domed-stadium"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4741769,"mean":5.692225354766,"rank":1010967,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":3721653,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4741769,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235229,"mean":4.5060492798479,"rank":45747,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":188913,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235229,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3431,"mean":5.7972437317784,"rank":773,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":2650,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3431,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":210,"mean":6.6413014354067,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":162,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":210,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
