The last problem - i.e., the damage of the device from a power injection - is not an unjustified fear, but a reality. A warning by the US Food and Drug Administration of July 2004 reports around 250 complications of this kind, referring to both port and central venous catheters and peripherally inserted central catheter systems, which occurred over a period of several years; in all cases, the damage occurred during the injection of contrast material by means of power injectors for computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging procedures. Though the risk associated with the use of ports in radiodiagnostics is thus clear, it has been suggested that administration of the contrast material via the port may have some advantage in terms of image quality, increased comfort for the patient, and maybe more accurate reproducibility of the patient's own follow-up exams. This contention needs to be supported by evidence. Also, since many cancer patients who need frequent computed tomography studies already have totally implantable systems, it would seem reasonable to try to define how and when such systems may safely be used. The purpose of this consensus statement is to define recommendations based on the best available evidence, for the safe use of implantable ports in radiodiagnostics.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f15","authors":["Bonciarelli G","Batacchi S","Biffi R","Buononato M","Damascelli B","Ghibaudo F","Orsi F","Pittiruti M","Scoppettuolo G","Verz\u00e8 A","Borasi G","De Cicco M","Dosio R","Gazzo P","Maso R","Roman A","Ticha V","Venier G","Blackburn P","Goossens GA","Bowen Santolucito J","Stas M","Van Boxtel T","Vesely TM","de Lutio E"],"doi":"10.5301\/jva.2011.7736","first_seen_on":"2012-02-14T14:12:41+00:00","issns":["1129-7298"],"issue":"4","journal":"The Journal of Vascular Access","last_mentioned_on":1329227615,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21534233"],"pmid":"21534233","pubdate":"2011-05-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wichtig Editore s.r.l.
