While evolutionarily related to bacterial RNase P, eukaryotic enzymes of the RNase P\/MRP family are much more complex. Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNase P consists of a catalytic RNA component and nine essential proteins; yeast RNase MRP has an RNA component resembling that in RNase P and 10 essential proteins, most of which are shared with RNase P. The structural organizations of eukaryotic RNases P\/MRP are not clear. Here we present the results of RNA-protein UV crosslinking studies performed on RNase P and RNase MRP holoenzymes isolated from yeast. The results indicate locations of specific protein-binding sites in the RNA components of RNase P and RNase MRP and shed light on the structural organizations of these large ribonucleoprotein complexes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f610008844","doi":"10.1261\/rna.030874.111","first_seen_on":"2012-02-14T00:31:12+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["1469-9001"],"journal":"RNA","last_mentioned_on":1332189034,"links":["http:\/\/rnajournal.cshlp.org\/content\/early\/2012\/02\/13\/rna.030874.111.abstract","http:\/\/rnajournal.cshlp.org\/content\/early\/2012\/02\/13\/rna.030874.111.short?rss=1&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/rnajournal.cshlp.org\/content\/18\/4\/720.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/rnajournal.cshlp.org\/content\/early\/2012\/02\/13\/rna.030874.111.full.pdf","pmid":"22332141","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Lab","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Structural organizations of yeast RNase P and RNase MRP holoenzymes as revealed by UV-crosslinking studies of RNA\u2013protein interactions","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structural-organizations-yeast-rnase-p-rnase-mrp-holoenzymes-revealed-uvcrosslinking-studies-rnaprot"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":1929644,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2536556,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234180,"mean":4.3104929477027,"rank":76983,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":154191,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234180,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1463,"mean":2.7411901504788,"rank":856,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":574,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1463,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":183,"mean":2.9345714285714,"rank":117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":58,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":183,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
