In Alzheimer's disease, \u03b2-amyloid is considered the primary contributor to neuropathology and neurodegeneration. It now is believed that certain systemic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, can contribute to neurodegeneration through the effects of chronic hyperglycemia\/insulin resistance resulting in protein glycation, oxidative stress and inflammation within susceptible brain regions. Here, we present an overview of research focusing on the role of protein glycation, oxidative stress, and inflammation in the neurodegenerative process. Of special interest in this paper is the effect of methylglyoxal (MGO), a cytotoxic byproduct of glucose metabolism, elevated in neurodegenerative disease, and diabetes mellitus, on cerebral protein function and oxidative stress. How MGO interacts with amino acid residues within \u03b2-amyloid, and small peptides within the brain, is also discussed in terms of the affect on protein function.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52a3cf058f610003f5e","authors":["Williams WM","Weinberg A","Smith MA"],"doi":"10.4061\/2011\/461216","first_seen_on":"2012-02-17T13:35:45+00:00","issns":["2090-0104"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Amino Acids","last_mentioned_on":1355259051,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22332001"],"pmcid":"PMC3276062","pmid":"22332001","pubdate":"2012-02-15T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Protein modification by dicarbonyl molecular species in neurodegenerative diseases.","type":"article","volume":"2011","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/protein-modification-dicarbonyl-molecular-species-neurodegenerative-diseases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
