We therefore investigated the impact of PN-1 on endothelial cell angiogenic responses in vitro and ex vivo and in vivo in PN-1-deficient mice. We found that PN-1 is antiangiogenic in vitro: it inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced endothelial cell responses, including proliferation, migration, and capillary tube formation, and decreased cell spreading on vitronectin. These effects do not require the antiprotease activity of PN-1 but involve PN-1 binding to glycosaminoglycans. In addition, our results indicated that PN-1 does not act by blocking VEGF binding to its heparan sulfate proteoglycan coreceptors. The results obtained in vitro were supported ex vivo in PN-1-deficient mice, where the microvascular network sprouting from aortic rings was significantly enhanced. Moreover, in vivo, neovessel formation was promoted in the Matrigel plug assay in PN-1-deficient mice compared to wild-type mice, and these effects were reversed by the addition of recombinant PN-1. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PN-1 has direct antiangiogenic properties and is a yet-unrecognized player in the angiogenic balance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f61000310d","doi":"10.1128\/mcb.06554-11","first_seen_on":"2012-02-15T13:34:49+00:00","issns":["1098-5549"],"journal":"Molecular & Cellular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1329312580,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22331468?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22331468","pubdate":"2012-02-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"In vitro and in vivo Anti-Angiogenic Properties of the Serpin Protease Nexin-1.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vitro-vivo-antiangiogenic-properties-serpin-protease-nexin1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":4206819,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237726,"mean":4.5673785592599,"rank":194692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237726,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3376,"mean":2.7873748148148,"rank":3127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3376,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78,"mean":1.2671948051948,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
