The prefabricated Alq(3) microwires act as nucleation centers for site-specific secondary vapor growth of DAAQ nanowires, resulting in the unique dendritic heterostructures. When the trunk was excited with a focused laser beam, emitted light of various colors was simultaneously channeled from the branched nanowires via both waveguiding and energy transfer. The intensity of the out-coupled emissions was modulated effectively by changing the polarization of the incident light.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Jian Yao Zheng","Yongli Yan","Xiaopeng Wang","Yong Sheng Zhao","Jiaxing Huang","Jiannian Yao"],"doi":"10.1021\/ja209815f","endpage":"2883","first_seen_on":"2012-02-16T13:45:03+00:00","issns":["0002-7863","1520-5126"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1329494164,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/ja209815f","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ja209815f"],"pmid":"22289083","pubdate":"2012-02-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"2880","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Wire-on-Wire Growth of Fluorescent Organic Heterojunctions","type":"article","volume":"134","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/wireonwire-growth-fluorescent-organic-heterojunctions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506762,"mean":5.1233691071599,"rank":359574,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":4146225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506762,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79345,"mean":4.4270165860052,"rank":6122,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":73216,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79345,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15478,"mean":4.1143144020159,"rank":1216,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":14259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15478,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":400,"mean":5.258030075188,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":351,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":400,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
