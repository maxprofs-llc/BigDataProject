This article describe the solution NMR structure of the conserved N-terminal domain of human Ube3A (residues 24-87) that contains two residues (Cys44 and Arg62) found to be mutated in patients with Angelman syndrome. The structure of this domain adopts a novel Zn-binding fold we called AZUL (Amino-terminal Zn-finger of Ube3a Ligase). The AZUL domain has a helix-loop-helix architecture with a Zn ion coordinated by four Cys residues arranged in Cys-X(4)-Cys-X(4)-Cys-X(28)-Cys motif. Three of the Zn-bound residues are located in a 23-residue long and well structured loop that connects two \u03b1-helicies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007b9d","authors":["Alexander Lemak","Adelinda Yee","Irina Bezsonova","Sirano Dhe-Paganon","Cheryl H.
