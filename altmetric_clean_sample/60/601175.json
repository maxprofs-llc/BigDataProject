Applying this theory to particular situations, we establish approximations by such series to solutions of the heat and Laplace equations as well as to probability density functions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002c9f","authors":["Vassili Nestoridis","Sebastian Schmutzhard","Vangelis Stefanopoulos"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jat.2011.06.001","endpage":"1797","first_seen_on":"2012-02-13T11:25:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00219045","0021-9045"],"issue":"12","journal":"Journal of Approximation Theory","last_mentioned_on":1329123635,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S002190451100102X?via=ihub"],"pmcid":"PMC5341757","pmid":"28298658","pubdate":"2011-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pure Mathematics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Applied Mathematics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Mathematics","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1783","title":"Universal series induced by approximate identities and some relevant applications","type":"article","volume":"163","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/universal-series-induced-approximate-identities-some-relevant-applications"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6561959,"mean":6.0802886866998,"rank":4853626,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":964435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6561959,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244530,"mean":4.7919087470199,"rank":155426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":43962,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244530,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":2.1759487179487,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Computer Science":1,"Mathematics":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/ElsevierMath\/status\/168982889680211970","citation_ids":[601175],"posted_on":"2012-02-13T09:00:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Elsevier Mathematics","url":"http:\/\/www.elsevier.com\/mathematics","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/620508855399804928\/vReyck7O_normal.jpg","description":"We aim to provide you with all relevant information on Elsevier's Mathematics and Statistics books and journals.","id_on_source":"ElsevierMath","tweeter_id":"61186291","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":4791},"tweet_id":"168982889680211970"}]}}
