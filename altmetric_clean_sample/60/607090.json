In the Australasian Leukaemia and Lymphoma Group (ALLG) MM6 randomized study comparing consolidation thalidomide and prednisolone with prednisolone alone following autologous stem cell transplant, patients on consolidation thalidomide and prednisolone had superior progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). We now show that thalidomide consolidation benefited both t(4;14)-positive (PFS 29 vs. 17 months, p =0.03) and -negative (52 vs. 24 months, p =0.04) disease. PFS for patients with normal FGFR3 expression was significantly better than for those with up-regulated FGFR3 (31 vs. 21 months, p =0.02). Consolidation thalidomide conferred an improved PFS in patients with normal FGFR3 expression (41 vs. 19 months, p =0.02), but there was no improvement in patients with up-regulated FGFR3 (31 vs. 29 months, p =0.76). We conclude that consolidation thalidomide may mitigate the poor prognostic effect of t(4;14), and improves PFS in normal but not up-regulated FGFR3 expression. Thus the level of FGFR3 expression provides additional prognostic information to t(4;14) in myeloma induction and consolidation therapy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52d3cf058f610004181","authors":["Ho P","Brown R","Spencer A","Jeffels M","Daniher D","Gibson J","Joshua D"],"doi":"10.3109\/10428194.2012.664842","endpage":"1734","first_seen_on":"2012-02-16T06:39:50+00:00","issns":["1029-2403","1042-8194"],"issue":"9","journal":"Leukemia & Lymphoma","last_mentioned_on":1329373703,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22329352"],"pmid":"22329352","pubdate":"2012-02-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"1728","subjects":["neoplasms","hematology"],"title":"Thalidomide consolidation improves progression-free survival in myeloma with normal but not upregulated expression of FGFR3: Analysis from the ALLG MM6 clinical trial.","type":"article","volume":"53","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/thalidomide-consolidation-improves-progressionfree-survival-myeloma-normal-not-upregulated-expressio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":3556444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":831448,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81619,"mean":4.7414792570266,"rank":50973,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":14355,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81619,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":831,"mean":1.6128506024096,"rank":506,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":181,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":831,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":0.95357142857143,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Other":3,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":7,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":5,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/Myeloma_Doc\/status\/170031751689797632","citation_ids":[607090],"posted_on":"2012-02-16T06:28:23+00:00","author":{"name":"Robert Z.
