These symptoms arose during an exacerbation of his post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Among his traumatic memories, he reported having witnessed the combat injury and death of a friend who had lost his left leg distal to the mid shin. A diagnosis of conversion disorder was technically excluded because the findings met criteria for Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) type I. Based on recent research into the neurobiology of CRPS, PTSD and conversion disorder, we propose a supraspinal mechanism which could explain how emotional stress can produce both symptoms and signs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003281","authors":["Grande LA","Loeser JD","Ozuna J","Ashleigh A","Samii A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pain.2004.03.032","first_seen_on":"2012-02-14T02:17:40+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Pain (03043959)","last_mentioned_on":1328640080,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15275803"],"pmid":"15275803","pubdate":"2004-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"Complex regional pain syndrome as a stress response.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-stress-response-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629283,"mean":4.9355109985986,"rank":2901279,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":77874,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629283,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230796,"mean":4.0052922117033,"rank":167415,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":713,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230796,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2185,"mean":4.9782664835165,"rank":1881,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":68,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2185,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197,"mean":2.8846224489796,"rank":165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
