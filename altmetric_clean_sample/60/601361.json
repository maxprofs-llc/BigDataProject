These neurosignature patterns may be triggered by sensory inputs, but they may also be generated independently of them. Acute pains evoked by brief noxious inputs have been meticulously investigated by neuroscientists, and their sensory transmission mechanisms are generally well understood. In contrast, chronic pain syndromes, which are often characterized by severe pain associated with little or no discernable injury or pathology, remain a mystery. Furthermore, chronic psychological or physical stress is often associated with chronic pain, but the relationship is poorly understood. The neuromatrix theory of pain provides a new conceptual framework to examine these problems. It proposes that the output patterns of the body-self neuromatrix activate perceptual, homeostatic, and behavioral programs after injury, pathology, or chronic stress. Pain, then, is produced by the output of a widely distributed neural network in the brain rather than directly by sensory input evoked by injury, inflammation, or other pathology. The neuromatrix, which is genetically determined and modified by sensory experience, is the primary mechanism that generates the neural pattern that produces pain. Its output pattern is determined by multiple influences, of which the somatic sensory input is only a part, that converge on the neuromatrix.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003283","authors":["Melzack, Ronald","Ronald Melzack"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1533-2500.2005.05203.x","endpage":"94","first_seen_on":"2012-02-13T13:51:53+00:00","issns":["1533-2500","1530-7085"],"issue":"2","journal":"Pain Practice","last_mentioned_on":1506357455,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1533-2500.2005.05203.x\/abstract;jsessionid=1F827CC483E4D1BD9266E35EBC43F7B8.d03t03","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17177754","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1533-2500.2005.05203.x","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17177754"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1533-2500.2005.05203.x\/pdf","pmid":"17177754","pubdate":"2005-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"85","subjects":["psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"Evolution of the Neuromatrix Theory of Pain.
