METHODS: Among 52,642 postmenopausal women, 2,321 developed invasive breast cancer with known estrogen- and progesterone-receptor status (1,652 ER+PR+, 338 ER+PR-, and 312 ER-PR-) between 1995 and 2007. In a subset of 35,529 with waist circumference data, 1,377 developed invasive breast cancer with known ERPR status (991 ER+PR+, 208 ER+PR-, 169 ER-PR-) between 1997 and 2007. Multivariate Cox regression was performed to estimate relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Obesity, adult weight gain of \u226540 pounds, greater abdominal adiposity, and greater height increased the risk of ER+PR+ breast cancer. The increased risk associated with postmenopausal obesity was limited to those who did not use hormone therapy (HT) at cohort entry (RR\u00a0=\u00a01.37; 95% CI, 1.05-1.78 for BMI\u00a0\u2265\u00a030 vs.\u00a0<\u00a025\u00a0kg\/m(2); p-interaction\u00a0=\u00a00.14) and those who were not overweight or obese at age 18 (p-interaction\u00a0=\u00a00.06). The increased risk associated with greater abdominal adiposity was limited to those who were not also overweight or obese (p-interaction\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Neither obesity, abdominal adiposity, nor height was associated with the risk of ER-PR- tumors. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of body size on postmenopausal breast cancer risk differed by hormone receptor subtype, and among women with ER+PR+ tumors, by HT use and early adult body size.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dc8","authors":["Canchola AJ","Anton-Culver H","Bernstein L","Clarke CA","Henderson K","Ma H","Ursin G","Horn-Ross PL","Alison J.
