In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study, 40 patients (10 losses) with CRS participated. Patients received either continuous or pulsed (1:9) 1 MHz ultrasound (US) using a US head of 1\u2009cm2 at 1 W\/cm2 and 0.5 W\/cm2 for the maxillary and frontal sinuses, respectively. Treatment was performed in 10 sessions, 3 days per week, with US given every other day. The primary outcome measure was percent improvement in the Sinusitis Symptom Score. Measurements were taken before and after 10 treatment sessions. The patients were followed up monthly for 2 months. After treatment, both groups improved significantly on the Sinusitis Symptoms Score. Patients who received PUS had significantly decreased total symptom scores compared with patients receiving CUS (mean change 9.8 vs. 5.6, p\u2009=\u20090.049). The percent improvement in the Sinusitis Symptom Score between the PUS group (65.2 SD 23.1) and the CUS group (43.9 SD 40.7) was not statistically significant (p\u2009=\u20090.09). The effect size for each treatment was large; PUS: d\u2009=\u20093.92 and CUS: d\u2009=\u20091.93. Symptom improvement in both groups was similar at the 2-month follow-up. These results support the use of therapeutic US for CRS. This pilot study gives only marginal evidence to favor PUS over CUS.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043d7","authors":["Noureddin Nakhostin Ansari","Mojtaba Fathali","Soofia Naghdi","Scott Hasson","Shohreh Jalaie","Mohammad Saeed Rastak"],"doi":"10.3109\/09593985.2011.571751","endpage":"94","first_seen_on":"2012-02-14T10:46:22+00:00","issns":["0959-3985","1532-5040"],"issue":"2","journal":"Physiotherapy Theory & Practice","last_mentioned_on":1325896398,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/09593985.2011.571751"],"pmid":"21823980","pubdate":"2012-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"85","subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine"],"title":"A randomized, double-blind clinical trial comparing the effects of continuous and pulsed ultrasound in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/randomized-doubleblind-clinical-trial-comparing-effects-continuous-pulsed-ultrasound-patients-chroni-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630815,"mean":4.9285062716012,"rank":2899155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":79953,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630815,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230810,"mean":3.9947826557893,"rank":167029,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":851,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230810,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179,"mean":2.9140112359551,"rank":134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.3083333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
