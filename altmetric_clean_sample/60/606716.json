Current evidence indicates that the mechanism for keeping track of individual objects can also be used for numerical purposes; if so, its accuracy will be independent of numerical ratio, but its capacity is limited to the number of items that can be tracked, about four. There is, however, growing controversy as to whether two separate number systems are present in other vertebrate species.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012PLoSO...7E1923A","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Christian Agrillo","Laura Piffer","Angelo Bisazza","Brian Butterworth"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0031923","first_seen_on":"2012-02-15T23:13:28+00:00","issns":["1932-6203",""],"issue":"2","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1492200003,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0031923","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0031923","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0031923","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22355405","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0031923","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0031923#s2","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0031923"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0031923.pdf","pmid":"22355405","pubdate":"2012-02-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e31923","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Evidence for Two Numerical Systems That Are Similar in Humans and Guppies","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evidence-two-numerical-systems-similar-humans-guppies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":64.398,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":7,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":64.398},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8072166,"mean":6.8521645392475,"rank":133630,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":7938463,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8072166,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250947,"mean":5.1933218142551,"rank":2708,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":248238,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250947,"percentile":98},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112344,"mean":10.552321337333,"rank":3477,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":108868,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112344,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3991,"mean":8.0064260651629,"rank":93,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":3898,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3991,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":12,"researcher":5,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":12,"Scientists":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":18,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Student  > Ph.
