CLOs share intracellular lifestyle and biphasic developmental cycle and they have been detected in environmental samples as well as in various hosts like amoebae and arthropods. In this study we screened bat faeces for the presence of CLOs by molecular analysis. Using Pan-Chlamydiales-PCR, targeting the 16S rRNA gene, Chlamydiales DNA was detected in 54% of the specimens. PCR amplification, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA were used to classify positive specimens and infer their phylogenetic relationships. Most sequences matched best with Rhabdochlamydia spp. or with uncultured Chlamydia sequences identified in ticks. Another set of sequences matched best with Chlamydia genus or with uncultured Chlamydiales from snakes. To gain evidence of whether CLOs in bat faeces are merely diet-borne, we analysed insects trapped from the same location where the bats foraged. Interestingly, the CLO sequences resembling Rhabdochlamydia spp. were detected in insect material as well, but the other set of CLO sequences was not, suggesting that this set might not originate from prey. Thus, bats represent another potential host for Chlamydiales and could harbour novel, earlier unidentified members of the order.\nSeveral pathogenic viruses are known to colonize bats, and recent analysis indicates that bats are also reservoir hosts for bacterial genera. Chlamydia-like organisms (CLO) have been detected in several animal species. CLO have a high 16S rRNA sequence similarity with Chlamydiaceae and exhibit similar intracellular lifestyle and biphasic developmental cycle. Our study describes frequent occurrence of CLO DNA in bat faeces suggesting expanding host species spectrum for Chlamydiales. As bats can acquire various infectious agents through their diet, also prey insects were studied. We identified CLO sequences in bats that matched best with sequences in prey insects but also CLO sequences not detected in prey insects. This suggests that a portion of CLO DNA present in bat faeces is not prey-borne. Furthermore, some sequences from bat droppings not originating from their diet might well represent novel, earlier unidentified members of the Chlamydiales order.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022c6","authors":["K Hokynar","E.
