Optic disc perfusion was studied using optical coherence tomography angiography (angio-OCT), and flow index and vessel density were determined. The VF, mean deviation (MD), pattern standard deviation (PSD), retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, and ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness were also recorded. The potential associations between disc perfusion and VF defects or structural loss were analyzed.\nIn OAG patients, the disc flow index and vessel density were significantly lower than in normal controls (all p<0.001) and were correlated with the severity of glaucoma. In OAG eyes, the flow index and vessel density were significantly correlated with MD, RNFL, and GCC thickness (all p<0.01), but were not in the normal controls. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis also revealed that disc flow index and vessel density had the power to differentiate normal eyes from eyes with OAG (under the ROC curves: 0.82 and 0.80, respectively).\nAngiograms demonstrated a reduced disc flow index and vessel density in glaucoma, and this reduction was closely related to GCC thickness. This indicated that measurement of disc perfusion by angio-OCT might be important for the monitoring of glaucoma.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002982","authors":["Xiaolei Wang","Chunhui Jiang","Tony Ko","Xiangmei Kong","Xiaobo Yu","Wang Min","Guohua Shi","Xinghuai Sun"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00417-015-3095-y","endpage":"1564","first_seen_on":"2016-03-16T07:14:45+00:00","issns":["1435-702X"],"issue":"9","journal":"Graefe's Archive of Clinical & Experimental Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1458010419,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s00417-015-3095-y"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00417-015-3095-y.pdf","pmid":"26255817","pubdate":"2015-08-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"1557","subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Correlation between optic disc perfusion and glaucomatous severity in patients with open-angle glaucoma: an optical coherence tomography angiography study","type":"article","volume":"253","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/correlation-between-optic-disc-perfusion-glaucomatous-severity-patients-openangle-glaucoma-optical-c"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7396084,"mean":6.428716941112,"rank":6400256,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7396084,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275551,"mean":10.907749040101,"rank":233116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275551,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":634,"mean":1.7054944707741,"rank":365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":634,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":3.275,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
