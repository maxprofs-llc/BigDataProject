The proportion with known and screen-detected (previously unknown) risk factors was: hypertension: 35% known, 13% screen-detected; hypercholesterolaemia: 32% and 37%; diabetes: 6.6% and 3.1%; and chronic kidney disease 1.1% and 4.5%. At least one screen-detected risk factor was found in 48% and two or more risk factors in 21% of patients. One in three patients (37%) not known to be high risk were found to have a high (>10%) 10-year CVD risk. Amongst the participants receiving treatment for known CVD risk factors, nearly half had suboptimal levels for blood pressure (46%) and cholesterol (46%).\nCardiovascular risk factor screening of primary care-based adults with psoriasis identified a high proportion of patients: a) at high CVD risk; b) with screen-detected risk factors and c) with sub-optimally managed known risk factors. These findings need to be considered alongside those which identified limited responses of clinicians to identified risk factors before universal CVD screening can be recommended.
