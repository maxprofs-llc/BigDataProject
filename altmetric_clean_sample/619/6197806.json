We investigated the role of combined cancer gene therapy with Hsulf-1 and cytosine deaminase\/5-fluorocytosine (CD\/5-FC) suicide gene on a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line, HepG2, in vitro and in vivo.\nReverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry were used to determine the expression of Hsulf-1 in HCC. Cell apoptosis was observed through flow cytometry instrument and mechanism of Hsulf-1 to enhance the cytotoxicity of 5-FC against HCC was analyzed in HCC by confocal microscopy. We also establish a nude mice model of HCC to address the effect of Hsulf-1 expression on the CD\/5-FC suicide gene therapy in vivo.\nA significant decrease in HepG2 cell proliferation and an increase in HepG2 cell apoptosis were observed when Hsulf-1 expression was combined with the CD\/5-FC gene suicide system. A noticeable bystander effect was observed when the Hsulf-1 and CD genes were co-expressed. Intracellular calcium was also increased after HepG2 cells were infected with the Hsulf-1 gene. In vivo studies showed that the suppression of tumor growth was more pronounced in animals treated with the Hsulf-1 plus CD than those treated with either gene therapy alone, and the combined treatment resulted in a significant increase in survival.\nHsulf-1 expression combined with the CD\/5-FC gene suicide system could be an effective treatment approach for HCC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e9d","authors":["Yang, Xiao-Ping","Liu, Ling","Wang, Ping","Ma, Sheng-Lin"],"doi":"10.4103\/0366-6999.156800","first_seen_on":"2016-03-16T13:25:04+00:00","issns":["0366-6999"],"issue":"10","journal":"Chinese Medical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1458125839,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25963362?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25963362","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1384","subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"Human Sulfatase-1 Improves the Effectiveness of Cytosine Deaminase Suicide Gene Therapy with 5-Fluorocytosine Treatment on Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cell Line HepG2 In Vitro and In Vivo","type":"article","volume":"128","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/human-sulfatase1-improves-effectiveness-cytosine-deaminase-suicide-gene-therapy-5fluorocytosine-trea"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7401456,"mean":6.433764966749,"rank":6405621,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7401456,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275611,"mean":10.911201415043,"rank":233362,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275611,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":802,"mean":1.3981747815231,"rank":507,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":802,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.5,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
