Both principal component analysis and cluster analysis showed consistently altered patterns with distinct differences in the treated groups versus the control groups. 4-EOTC treatment at 5.0 or 50.0\u2009mg\/kg increased the relative abundance of the Actinobacteria, specifically Bifidobacteriaceae, and improved the synthesis of lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC), as shown by the lipid biomarkers LysoPC(16:0), LysoPC(18:3), LysoPC(20:3), and LysoPC(20:4). The metabolomic analysis of urine samples also identified four other decreased metabolites: diacylglycerol, sphingomyelin, triacylglycerol, and phosphatidylglycerol. Notably, the significant changes observed in these biomarkers demonstrated the ongoing disorder induced by 4-EOTC. Blood and urine analysis revealed that residual 4-EOTC accumulated in the rats, even two weeks after oral 4-EOTC administration, ceased. Thus, through thorough analysis, it can be concluded that the alteration of the gut microbiota and disorders in blood metabolomics are correlated with 4-EOTC treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Han, Hongxing","Xiao, Hailong","Zhang, Kai","Lu, Zhenmei","Hongxing Han","Hailong Xiao","Kai Zhang","Zhenmei Lu"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep23141","first_seen_on":"2016-03-16T13:11:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1496512580,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26976662?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep23141","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26976662?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26976662","pubdate":"2016-03-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Metabolomics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Microbial communities","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Predictive markers","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"23141","subjects":["science"],"title":"Impact of 4-epi-oxytetracycline on the gut microbiota and blood metabolomics of Wistar rats","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-4epioxytetracycline-gut-microbiota-blood-metabolomics-wistar-rats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.83,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.83},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8314034,"mean":7.0059620328577,"rank":1133866,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":7177901,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8314034,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281869,"mean":11.212295031716,"rank":52961,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":228535,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281869,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36213,"mean":14.70380956589,"rank":8133,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":28057,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36213,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3091,"mean":16.666122977346,"rank":760,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":2328,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3091,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
