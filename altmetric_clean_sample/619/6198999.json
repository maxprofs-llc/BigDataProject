It refers to the network of computers, laptops, mobile devices or tablets which is remotely controlled by the cybercriminals to initiate various distributed coordinated attacks including spam emails, ad-click fraud, Bitcoin mining, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), disseminating other malwares and much more. Likewise traditional PC based botnet, Mobile botnets have the same operational impact except the target audience is particular to smartphone users. Therefore, it is import to uncover this security issue prior to its widespread adaptation. We propose SMARTbot, a novel dynamic analysis framework augmented with machine learning techniques to automatically detect botnet binaries from malicious corpus. SMARTbot is a component based off-device behavioral analysis framework which can generate mobile botnet learning model by inducing Artificial Neural Networks' back-propagation method. Moreover, this framework can detect mobile botnet binaries with remarkable accuracy even in case of obfuscated program code. The results conclude that, a classifier model based on simple logistic regression outperform other machine learning classifier for botnet apps' detection, i.e 99.49% accuracy is achieved. Further, from manual inspection of botnet dataset we have extracted interesting trends in those applications. As an outcome of this research, a mobile botnet dataset is devised which will become the benchmark for future studies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Ahmad Karim","Rosli Salleh","Muhammad Khurram Khan"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0150077","first_seen_on":"2016-03-16T14:35:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"3","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1475542888,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0150077"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0150077.PDF","pmid":"26978523","pubdate":"2016-03-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0150077","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"SMARTbot: A Behavioral Analysis Framework Augmented with Machine Learning to Identify Mobile Botnet Applications","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/smartbot-behavioral-analysis-framework-augmented-machine-learning-identify-mobile-botnet-application"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.85,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7476637,"mean":6.4841716895094,"rank":604216,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":6870515,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7476637,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":276226,"mean":10.939434489999,"rank":33646,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":242448,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":276226,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106877,"mean":10.185852146413,"rank":13726,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":93107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106877,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5377,"mean":12.962527901786,"rank":767,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":4609,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5377,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":14},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":14}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
