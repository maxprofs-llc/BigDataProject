However, studies have shown that prognoses (e.g., progression and mortality) differ even among individuals with similar clinical and pathological characteristics. Existing risk classifiers (TMN grading system, Gleason score, etc.) are not accurately enough to represent the biological features of PCa. Using new genomic technologies, novel biomarkers and classifiers have been developed and shown to add value to clinical or pathological risk factors for predicting aggressive disease. Among them, RNA testing (gene expression analysis) is useful because it can not only reflect genetic variations but also reflect epigenetic regulations. Commercially available RNA profiling tests (Oncotype Dx, Prolaris, and Decipher) have demonstrated strong abilities to discriminate PCa with poor prognosis from less aggressive diseases. For instance, these RNA profiling tests can predict disease progression in active surveillance patients or early recurrence after radical treatments. These tests may offer more dependable methods for PCa prognosis prediction to make more accurate and personal medical decisions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006b55","authors":["Na, Rong","Wu, Yishuo","Ding, Qiang","Xu, Jianfeng"],"first_seen_on":"2016-03-16T14:18:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1745-7262"],"journal":"Asian Journal of Andrology","last_mentioned_on":1465085790,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26975490?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26975490"],"pmid":"26975490","pubdate":"2016-03-16T22:01:09+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Clinically available RNA profiling tests of prostate tumors: utility and comparison.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinically-available-rna-profiling-tests-prostate-tumors-utility-comparison"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7856296,"mean":6.655704591281,"rank":5958369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1052259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7856296,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279086,"mean":11.029269627532,"rank":197499,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":40693,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279086,"percentile":14},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":416,"mean":4.3778987951807,"rank":276,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":94,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":416,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.203125,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
