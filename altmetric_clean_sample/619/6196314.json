Recently, murine studies have highlighted the proinflammatory role of retinoic acid in maintaining inflammation under a variety of pathologic conditions. However, as a result of limited human data, we investigated the effect of retinoic acid on human dendritic cells and CD4(+) T cell responses in the presence of polarizing (Th1\/Th9\/Th17) and inflammatory (LPS-induced dendritic cells) conditions. We report a novel role of retinoic acid in an inflammatory setup, where retinoic acid-primed dendritic cells (retinoic acid-monocyte-derived dendritic cells) up-regulated CCR9(+)T cells, which were observed to express high levels of IFN-\u03b3 in the presence of Th1\/Th17 conditions. Retinoic acid-monocyte-derived dendritic cells, under Th17 conditions, also favored the induction of IL-17(+) T cells. Furthermore, in the presence of TGF-\u03b21 and IL-4, retinoic acid-monocyte-derived dendritic cells inhibited IL-9 and induced IFN-\u03b3 expression on T cells. Experiments with na\u00efve CD4(+) T cells, activated in the presence of Th1\/Th17 conditions and absence of DCs, indicated that retinoic acid inhibited IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17 expression on T cells. These data revealed that in the face of inflammatory conditions, retinoic acid, in contrast from its anti-inflammatory role, could maintain or aggravate the intestinal inflammation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007d16","authors":["Ritika Rampal","Amit Awasthi","Vineet Ahuja","Rampal, Ritika","Awasthi, Amit","Ahuja, Vineet"],"doi":"10.1189\/jlb.3vma1015-476r","first_seen_on":"2016-03-16T12:30:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1938-3673","0741-5400"],"journal":"Journal of Leukocyte Biology","last_mentioned_on":1460823038,"links":["http:\/\/www.jleukbio.org\/content\/early\/2016\/03\/10\/jlb.3VMA1015-476R.short?rss=1","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26980802?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jleukbio.org\/content\/early\/2016\/03\/10\/jlb.3VMA1015-476R.full.pdf","pmid":"26980802","pubdate":"2016-03-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Retinoic acid-primed human dendritic cells inhibit Th9 cells and induce Th1\/Th17 cell differentiation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/retinoic-acidprimed-human-dendritic-cells-inhibit-th9-cells-induce-th1th17-cell-differentiation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7556298,"mean":6.524637537139,"rank":2880865,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4651146,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7556298,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":276999,"mean":10.960884562343,"rank":96437,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":179023,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":276999,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1081,"mean":4.5964074074074,"rank":386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":689,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1081,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":4.39125,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
