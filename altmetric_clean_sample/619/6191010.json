Ischemia\/hypoxia injury remains an unresolved and complicated situation in the diseases of ischemia stroke, heart failure, and coronary heart disease, especially among the old folks. Studies have demonstrated that aging could enhance the vulnerability of brain, heart, lung, liver, and kidney to ischemia\/hypoxia injury and the susceptibility in old folks to ischemia\/hypoxia injury might be associated with Sirt1. In this review, we mainly summarize the role of Sirt1 in modulating pathways against energy depletion and its involvement in oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation under the condition of ischemia\/hypoxia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c8","authors":["Xiaofei Meng","Jin Tan","Mengmeng Li","Shuling Song","Yuyang Miao","Qiang Zhang","Meng, Xiaofei","Tan, Jin","Li, Mengmeng","Song, Shuling","Miao, Yuyang","Zhang, Qiang"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10571-016-0355-2","first_seen_on":"2016-03-16T05:54:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-6830","0272-4340"],"journal":"Cellular & Molecular Neurobiology","last_mentioned_on":1458086014,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs10571-016-0355-2","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26971525?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10571-016-0355-2.pdf","pmid":"26971525","pubdate":"2016-03-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurobiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology","neurology"],"title":"Sirt1: Role Under the Condition of Ischemia\/Hypoxia","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sirt1-role-under-condition-ischemiahypoxia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7396084,"mean":6.428716941112,"rank":5335859,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1800925,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7396084,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275550,"mean":10.907923810284,"rank":178568,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":81372,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275550,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":423,"mean":2.4363412322275,"rank":221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":188,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":423,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":2.8962686567164,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
