We are developing phosphopeptide mimetics targeting the SH2 domain of STAT6 to block recruitment to phosphotyrosine residues on IL-4 or IL-13 receptors and subsequent Tyr641 phosphorylation to inhibit the expression of genes contributing to asthma. Structure-affinity relationship studies showed that phosphopeptides based on Tyr631 from IL-4R\u03b1 bind with weak affinity to STAT6 whereas replacing the pY+3 residue with simple aryl and alkyl amides resulted in affinities in the mid to low nM range. A set of phosphatase-stable, cell-permeable prodrug analogs inhibited cytokine-stimulated STAT6 phosphorylation in both Beas-2B human airway cells and primary mouse T-lymphocytes at concentrations as low as 100 nM. IL-13-stimulated expression of CCL26 (eotaxin-3) was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating that targeting the SH2 domain blocks both phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of STAT6.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e47","authors":["Mandal, Pijus K","Morlacchi, Pietro","Knight, John Morgan","Link, Todd M","Lee, Gilbert R","Nurieva, Roza","Singh, Divyendu","Dhanik, Ankur","Kavraki, Lydia E","Corry, David B","Ladbury, John E","McMurray, John S","Pijus K.
