We have developed a 3-step algorithm for such differential diagnosis that can be applied without having to rely on the comparison with a reference electrocardiogram. It is based on the observation that the frontal plane sinus P vector loop is almost invariably inscribed counterclockwise. The 5 types of electrocardiograms of limb lead misplacement can be differentiated according to the P wave axis, the location of the lead aVR in the electrocardiogram, and specifically any apparent reversal of the direction of inscription of the frontal plane P vector loop due to lead misplacement. Characteristic limb lead P wave patterns provide 6 signs capable of inferring from the electrocardiogram alone the direction of inscription about 94% of the time. P wave axis itself is diagnostic in an additional 4%.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c56","authors":["Kalon K.L. Ho","Shiu K.
