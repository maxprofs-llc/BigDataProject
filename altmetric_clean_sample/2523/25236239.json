A wide range of molecular determinants and cellular components work in concert to control the magnitude and duration of a given immune response. In the past decade, microRNAs (miRNAs), a major class of small non-coding RNA species, have been extensively studied as key molecular players in immune regulation. In this chapter, we will discuss how miRNAs function as negative regulators to restrict innate and adaptive immune responses. Moreover, we will review the current reports regarding miRNAs in human immunological diseases. Finally, we will also address the emerging roles of other non-coding RNAs, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in particular, in the regulation of the immune system.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9263cf058f61000dd01","authors":["Cheng-Jang Wu","Li-Fan Lu"],"book":[],"doi":"10.1007\/82_2017_65","first_seen_on":"2017-09-14T08:38:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0070-217X"],"journal":"Current topics in microbiology and immunology","last_mentioned_on":1505393945,"links":["https:\/\/link.springer.com\/chapter\/10.1007%2F82_2017_65","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28900683?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"ordinal_number":65,"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2F82_2017_65.pdf","pmid":"28900683","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"MicroRNA in Immune Regulation","type":"chapter","uri":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/chapter\/10.1007\/82_2017_65"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0.5,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414430,"mean":7.0825007427048,"rank":6385304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1142382,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414430,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128215,"mean":11.786218556476,"rank":89880,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":24109,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128215,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":481,"mean":2.3978833333333,"rank":342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":87,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":481,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Microbiome_Art\/statuses\/908248424721649664","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25236239],"posted_on":"2017-09-14T08:37:53+00:00","author":{"name":"Microbiome Articles","url":"https:\/\/maximeborry.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/778305348469919744\/Kq4NuIyd_normal.jpg","description":"A bot retrieving and twitting all the latest Microbiome articles from PubMed.\nMade by @notmaxib","id_on_source":"Microbiome_Art","tweeter_id":"778208387754582018","geo":{"lt":48.84598,"ln":2.20289,"country":"FR"},"followers":398},"tweet_id":"908248424721649664"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/lncRNA_papers\/statuses\/908314157862100992","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25236239],"posted_on":"2017-09-14T12:59:05+00:00","author":{"name":"lncRNApapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/632251582499852288\/nfPQQhIV_normal.png","description":"Bringing you the latest in #lncRNA scientific literature. #lincRNA #longnoncodingRNA #RNA #biochem #pubmed #science","id_on_source":"lncRNA_papers","tweeter_id":"3315333763","geo":{"lt":40.01499,"ln":-105.27055,"country":"US"},"followers":409},"tweet_id":"908314157862100992"}]}}
