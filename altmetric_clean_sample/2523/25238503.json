Incidence and predictors of these tachyarrhythmias have not been well established. We retrospectively studied all consecutive patients (N = 243, age 75 +\/- 10 years; 47% men) admitted to the emergency department of a general hospital between January 1998 and July 2000 for symptomatic bradyarrhythmia. Concomitant therapy included diuretics (25%), digitalis (10%), beta-blockers (10%), amiodarone (2%), and verapamil or diltiazem (8%). Syncope was the most frequent symptom at admission (54%). The most prevalent inclusion bradyarrhythmia was > or =second-degree AV block (82%). Eleven patients (4.5%) presented VF or TdP. Univariate predictors for these complications were previous amiodarone or diuretic intake, presentation as syncope, low serum potassium level, and longer QTc at admission. Multivariate analysis with logistic regression showed only therapy with diuretics and\/or amiodarone and QTc at admission as significant predictors for TdP or VF development. Incidence of VF or TdP in patients admitted for symptomatic bradyarrhythmia is relatively important. A prolonged QTc interval and\/or therapy with amiodarone or diuretics can predict their presentation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c56","authors":["\u00d3scar D\u0131\u0301az-Castro","Alberto Puchol","Jesus Almendral","Esteban G Torrecilla","Angel Arenal","Manuel Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Selles"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jelectrocard.2003.10.003","first_seen_on":"2017-09-14T09:24:30+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["00220736","0022-0736"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Electrocardiology","last_mentioned_on":1267488000,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jelectrocard.2003.10.003"],"pmid":"15132370","pubdate":"2004-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Predictors of in-hospital ventricular fibrillation or torsades de pointes in patients with acute symptomatic bradycardia","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/predictors-inhospital-ventricular-fibrillation-torsades-pointes-patients-acute-symptomatic-bradycard-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8374144,"mean":7.0586341778417,"rank":2147457,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5083832,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8374144,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108559,"mean":11.664681700105,"rank":33459,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":74400,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108559,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246,"mean":7.8950775510204,"rank":70,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":4.8125,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"policy":[{"title":"Prevention of Torsade de Pointes in Hospital Settings","url":"http:\/\/www.onlinejacc.org\/content\/accj\/55\/9\/934.full.pdf","license":"public","citation_ids":[25238339,25238356,25238359,25238360,707326,25238071,4067210,25238364,25238365,25238367,25238369,25238370,25238372,25238373,25238375,25238384,25238387,25238388,25238390,25238391,16702929,25238394,25238396,25238399,25238400,25238409,5756378,25238412,25238413,25238415,25238416,25238417,25238418,25238420,25238423,25238425,25238427,14980728,25238428,25238434,25238436,25238445,519281,25238450,25238453,25238455,7575880,25238456,25238462,6471966,173748,25238464,25238466,1124665,25238470,25238471,25238480,25238482,25238484,25238488,3066468,25238493,25238503,3250475,25238511,25238516,25238534,25238537,16175454,3315533,25238540,142673,25238567,25238575,25238579,25238585,16175453,25238589,25238592,25238596,25238604,25238605,25238606,25238609,25238623,25238628,25238631,25238654,25238661,25238668,25238672,923563,16332584,5379190,25238709,25238711],"posted_on":"2010-03-02T00:00:00+00:00","source":{"name":"American College of Cardiology","description":"The mission of the American College of Cardiology is to transform cardiovascular care and improve heart health.
