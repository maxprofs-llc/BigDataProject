Therefore, there is a great need for developing rapid and sensitive methods to detect food allergens. In this paper, an aptamer highly specific to egg white lysozyme was coupled to dendritic silver nanoparticles in order to perform surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The procedure was successfully tested in water and on a stainless steel food-handling surface. The lowest detectable concentration for lysozyme was 0.5 \u03bcg\/mL in water and 5 \u03bcg\/mL on a stainless steel food-handling surface. Principal component analysis shows a significant change in SERS spectra when lysozyme was present, suggesting the successful capture of lysozyme by the aptamer. Quantification of lysozyme target was also shown from 0 to 6 \u03bcg\/mL, that is, 0, 0.5, 2, 6 \u03bcg\/mL. Overall method took less than 40 min. The developed method can be extended to detect other food allergens using specific aptamers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fe9","authors":["Victoria Boushell","Shintaro Pang","Lili He"],"doi":"10.1111\/1750-3841.13582","first_seen_on":"2017-04-15T10:04:18+00:00","issns":["00221147"],"journal":"Journal of Food Science","last_mentioned_on":1492250644,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27973744?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27973744","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Aptamer-Based SERS Detection of Lysozyme on a Food-Handling Surface","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aptamerbased-sers-detection-lysozyme-foodhandling-surface"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8071305,"mean":6.8537279477937,"rank":6988072,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8071305,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236900,"mean":12.854636186729,"rank":193314,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236900,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1712,"mean":6.6297907656341,"rank":1341,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1712,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":1.7172340425532,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/FoodAllergyNCBI\/statuses\/853187157418139648","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18839996],"posted_on":"2017-04-15T10:04:04+00:00","author":{"name":"food_allergy_feed","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"FoodAllergyNCBI","tweeter_id":"1323728234","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":142},"tweet_id":"853187157418139648"}]}}
