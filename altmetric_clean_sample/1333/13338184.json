Plant and their parts are known to have various kinds of primary and secondary metabolites which reduce the metal salts to metal nanoparticles. Shape, size and stability of Pd and Pt nanoparticles are influenced by pH, temperature, incubation time and concentrations of plant extract and that of the metal salt. Pd and Pt nanoparticles are broadly used as catalyst, as drug, drug carrier and in cancer treatment. They have shown size- and shape-dependent specific and selective therapeutic properties. In this review, we have discussed the biogenic fabrication of Pd\/Pt nanoparticles, their potential application as catalyst, medicine, biosensor, medical diagnostic and pharmaceuticals.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000877","authors":["Khwaja Salahuddin Siddiqi","Khwaja Salahuddin Siddiqi","Azamal Husen"],"doi":"10.1186\/s11671-016-1695-z","first_seen_on":"2016-11-04T13:10:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1556-276X","1931-7573"],"issue":"1","journal":"Nanoscale Research Letters","last_mentioned_on":1478265017,"links":["http:\/\/nanoscalereslett.springeropen.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s11671-016-1695-z"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/nanoscalereslett.springeropen.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s11671-016-1695-z?site=nanoscalereslett.springeropen.com","pmid":"27807824","pubdate":"2016-11-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Condensed Matter Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Materials Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Materials Science","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Molecular Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nanochemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nanoscale Science and Technology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nanotechnology and Microengineering","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"title":"Green Synthesis, Characterization and Uses of Palladium\/Platinum Nanoparticles","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/green-synthesis-characterization-uses-palladiumplatinum-nanoparticles"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7644999,"mean":6.5733031223765,"rank":3192698,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4341935,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7644999,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233926,"mean":12.835644509992,"rank":97632,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":132625,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233926,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":550,"mean":1.5551621129326,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":475,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":550,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":3.1637647058824,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
