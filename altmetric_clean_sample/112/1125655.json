Current Dietary Guidelines from the US Department of Agriculture and the American Heart Association advocate a food-based diet for optimal health and prevention of chronic disease. Considerable research has focused on implementing these guidelines for maximal cardiovascular risk reduction, and this review will discuss the role of specific dietary strategies and select nutrition supplements in achieving this goal.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000585d","authors":["Hill AM","Fleming JA","Kris-Etherton PM","Alison M Hill","Jennifer A Fleming","Penny M Kris-Etherton"],"doi":"10.1097\/hco.0b013e32832f2fb1","endpage":"441","first_seen_on":"2012-12-15T03:16:44+00:00","handle":"1959.8\/135158","handles":["1959.8\/135158"],"isbns":[],"issns":["0268-4705"],"issue":"5","journal":"Current opinion in cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1388534400,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-cardiology\/Abstract\/2009\/09000\/The_role_of_diet_and_nutritional_supplements_in.8.aspx","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1097\/HCO.0b013e32832f2fb1","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1097\/hco.0b013e32832f2fb1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/co-cardiology\/2009\/09000\/The_role_of_diet_and_nutritional_supplements_in.8.pdf","pmid":"19638931","pubdate":"2009-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"433","subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"The role of diet and nutritional supplements in preventing and treating cardiovascular disease","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/content.wkhealth.com\/linkback\/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&an=00001573-200909000-00008","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-diet-nutritional-supplements-preventing-treating-cardiovascular-disease-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7249214,"mean":6.3639994515233,"rank":1594633,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":5623978,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7249214,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":289863,"mean":6.5061231827559,"rank":73504,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":214534,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":289863,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":760,"mean":1.3662503293808,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":710,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":760,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":1.2844444444444,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
