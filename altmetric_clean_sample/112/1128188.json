Regeneration occurs from the dorsal iris by transdifferentiation of the pigment epithelial cells. Interestingly, the ventral iris never contributes to regeneration. Frogs have limited lens regeneration capacity elicited from the cornea during pre-metamorphic stages. The axolotl is another salamander which, like the newt, regenerates its limbs or its tail with the spinal cord, but up until now all reports have shown that it does not regenerate the lens.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007aa","authors":["Rinako Suetsugu-Maki","Nobuyasu Maki","Kenta Nakamura","Saulius Sumanas","Jie Zhu","Katia Del Rio-Tsonis","Panagiotis A Tsonis","Suetsugu-Maki, Rinako","Maki, Nobuyasu","Nakamura, Kenta","Sumanas, Saulius","Zhu, Jie","Del Rio-Tsonis, Katia","Tsonis, Panagiotis A"],"doi":"10.1186\/1741-7007-10-103","first_seen_on":"2012-12-17T12:28:27+00:00","issns":["1741-7007"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Biology","last_mentioned_on":1384512900,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1741-7007\/10\/103\/abstract","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1741-7007\/10\/103"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1741-7007-10-103.pdf","pmid":"23244204","pubdate":"2012-12-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"103","subjects":["biology"],"title":"Lens regeneration in axolotl: new evidence of developmental plasticity","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lens-regeneration-axolotl-new-evidence-developmental-plasticity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.818,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.818},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8029773,"mean":6.8058472945396,"rank":582012,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7447971,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8029773,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":287490,"mean":6.8377774801819,"rank":25724,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":261766,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":287490,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":868,"mean":14.576793540946,"rank":215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":653,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":868,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":14.202064516129,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
