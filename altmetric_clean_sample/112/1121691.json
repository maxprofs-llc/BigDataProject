Ultrasound images have been used to highlight anatomical variants of the median nerve, and CTS is thought to be associated to enlargement of the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve. However, there remains controversy regarding the most appropriate cutoff values of the computer measurements including the CSA, flattening ratio, and palmar bowing of median nerve, especially given that they can be influenced by image artifacts and factors that differ between individual patients. This study proposed a modified ultrasound compound imaging technique by moving fingers to reduce image artifacts, and the estimates of the normalized CSA [i.e., CSA at the wrist (CSAw) to CSA at the midforearm] with the aim of reducing discrepancies in CSA estimates and improving the ability of CTS discrimination.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5023cf058f61000309b","doi":"10.1118\/1.4767754","first_seen_on":"2012-12-13T11:05:37+00:00","issns":["0094-2405"],"issue":"12","journal":"Medical Physics","last_mentioned_on":1355396718,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23231290?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23231290","pubdate":"2012-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics"],"title":"Carpal tunnel syndrome diagnosis by a self-normalization process and ultrasound compound imaging.","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-diagnosis-selfnormalization-process-ultrasound-compound-imaging"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3636226,"mean":4.921076943263,"rank":2901514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":78469,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3636226,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":276857,"mean":5.6842163218426,"rank":220151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":963,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":276857,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":825,"mean":1.9829684466019,"rank":704,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":825,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":2.1206666666667,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
