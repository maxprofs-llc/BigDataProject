In this study, we checked each medication dose in 744 medical orders and identified a prevalence rate of 0.53 medication errors per medical order. The highest prevalence was in the critical care unit (0.98), and the most frequent type was dose omission (53%). The results were published bimonthly for health care professionals, with an improvement recommendation list to minimize medication errors and increase patient safety.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a6e","doi":"10.1097\/ncq.0b013e3182641b1b","first_seen_on":"2012-12-17T20:47:19+00:00","issns":["1057-3631"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Nursing Care Quality","last_mentioned_on":1356123628,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jncqjournal\/Abstract\/2013\/01000\/A_Survey_of_Medication_Error_Prevalence_in_a.13.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jncqjournal\/2013\/01000\/A_Survey_of_Medication_Error_Prevalence_in_a.13.pdf","pmid":"22796732","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"92","subjects":["nursing"],"title":"A Survey of Medication Error Prevalence in a Brazilian Health Center","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/survey-medication-error-prevalence-brazilian-health-center"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629591,"mean":4.9337473984712,"rank":2900761,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":78240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629591,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271318,"mean":5.7804554303638,"rank":216710,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":815,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271318,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195,"mean":2.1786082474227,"rank":161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":2.3352941176471,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
