All day surgery procedures performed between 1996 and 2006 were included except those under surgically administered local anaesthetic. The outcome measures assessed were unplanned admissions and symptoms reported after discharge. The overall admission rate was 2.6%, the admission rate for anaesthetic-related reasons was 1.5%, and 49% of patients reported some symptoms after discharge. Over the period studied the admission rate fell from 4.2% to 2.0%, admissions for anaesthetic-related reasons fell from 3.0% to 0.7% and reported symptoms fell from 67% to 37%. Consultants anaesthetists were associated with the lowest unplanned admission rate (consultants 2.3%, staff grade and associate specialists 3.1%, and trainees 3.3%), the lowest admission rate for anaesthetic reasons (consultants 1.2%, staff and associate specialists 2.0%, and trainees 1.8%), lower than expected specialty-weighted admissions and the lowest number of reported symptoms (consultants 47.3%, staff grade and associate specialists 52.6%, trainees 49.0%) (p < 0.001). We conclude that there was an improvement in outcome over the period of study and that the grade of anaesthetist is associated with outcome after day surgery.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002242","authors":["Hanousek J","Stocker ME","Montgomery JE"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1365-2044.2008.05730.x","first_seen_on":"2012-12-12T21:50:45+00:00","issns":["0003-2409"],"issue":"2","journal":"Anaesthesia","last_mentioned_on":1355349032,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/19143692\/?i=44&from=consultant%20anaesthetist"],"pmid":"19143692","pubdate":"2009-01-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["anesthesiology"],"title":"The effect of grade of anaesthetist on outcome after day surgery.","type":"article","volume":"64","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-grade-anaesthetist-outcome-after-day-surgery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":4203997,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285108,"mean":6.1390505178756,"rank":235879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285108,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1790,"mean":5.1301229737283,"rank":1467,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1790,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186,"mean":4.9346594594595,"rank":174,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Professor":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":10}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/iceman_ex\/statuses\/278980180578557952","license":"public","citation_ids":[1120791],"posted_on":"2012-12-12T21:50:32+00:00","author":{"name":"#hellomynameis Segun","url":"http:\/\/intensivecarenetwork.com\/about\/icn-uk\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/905470202221125632\/VKdm9Zd4_normal.jpg","description":"Husband to @monanniecupcake. #FOAMed\/#FOAMcc\/#FOAMus.
