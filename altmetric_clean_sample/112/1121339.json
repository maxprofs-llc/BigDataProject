We describe the synthesis of graphene sheets decorated with ultrathin, Si-rich two-dimensional (2D) islands (i.e., Gr:Si sheets), in which the electronic property of graphene is modulated by coupling with the Si-islands. Analyses based on transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and electron and optical spectroscopies confirmed that Si-islands with thicknesses of ~2 to 4 nm and a lateral size of several tens of nm were bonded to graphene via van der Waals interactions. Field-effect transistors (FETs) based on Gr:Si sheets exhibited enhanced transconductance and maximum-to-minimum current level compared to bare-graphene FETs, and their magnitudes gradually increased with increasing coverage of Si layers on the graphene. The temperature dependent current-voltage measurements of the Gr:Si sheet showed approximately a 2-fold increase in the resistance by decreasing the temperature from 250 to 10 K, which confirmed the opening of the substantial bandgap (~2.5-3.2 meV) in graphene by coupling with Si islands.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006816","authors":["Dong Hyun Lee","Jaeseok Yi","Jung Min Lee","Sang Jun Lee","Yong-Joo Doh","Hu Young Jeong","Zonghoon Lee","Ungyu Paik","John A.
