We are also long overdue in identifying moderators of CBT response (e.g., cognitive abilities) in late life anxiety. The goals of the current investigation were to examine performance on verbal versus nonverbal tests of executive skills (ES) and to test the relation between ES and clinical indices in older GAD patients. Hierarchical and logistic regression models identified baseline ES predictors of premature termination, homework compliance and quality, and indices of cognitive restructuring, an essential component of CBT. Although the analyses of response on symptom measures did not reveal any significant baseline predictors, an alternative ES grouping scheme showed that those whose ES improved during CBT also responded best in terms of worry reduction. These findings can be applied to the optimization of treatment for older anxiety patients, who are an underserved demographic group.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c8a","authors":["Jan Mohlman"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.janxdis.2012.12.001","first_seen_on":"2012-12-13T12:32:19+00:00","issns":["08876185"],"journal":"Journal of Anxiety Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1360184523,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0887618512001399"],"pmid":"23376600","pubdate":"2012-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"title":"Executive skills in older adults with GAD: Relations with clinical variables and CBT outcome","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/executive-skills-older-adults-gad-relations-clinical-variables-cbt-outcome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":2055317,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2956011,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285317,"mean":6.139118962834,"rank":96989,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":186449,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285317,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":660,"mean":3.1199817905918,"rank":256,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":399,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":660,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":3.0240833333333,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
