In fact, stem cells can be considered revolutionary in the field of medicine, especially in the treatment of a wide range of human diseases. However, caution is needed in the clinical application of such cells and this is an issue that demands more studies. This paper will discuss some controversial issues of importance for achieving cell therapy safety and success. Particularly, the following aspects of stem cell biology will be presented: methods for stem cells culture, teratogenic or tumorigenic potential, cellular dose, proliferation, senescence, karyotyping, and immunosuppressive activity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cd1","authors":["Maranduba, Carlos Magno da Costa"],"doi":"10.1155\/2012\/758102","first_seen_on":"2012-12-13T01:54:06+00:00","issns":["1110-7243"],"journal":"Journal of Biomedicine & Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1355718146,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/biomed\/2012\/758102\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/biomed\/2012\/758102.pdf","pmid":"23226945","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","biotechnology"],"title":"Toward Personalized Cell Therapies by Using Stem Cells: Seven Relevant Topics for Safety and Success in Stem Cell Therapy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/toward-personalized-cell-therapies-using-stem-cells-seven-relevant-topics-safety-success-stem-cell-t"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.58,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.58},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":322317,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":4185062,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281462,"mean":5.9139566405291,"rank":26309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":255152,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281462,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":351,"mean":3.1774457142857,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":331,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":351,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.8928571428571,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
