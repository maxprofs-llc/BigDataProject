We previously studied the main active constituents of TSSPs and their structure-activity relationships with respect to rat myometrial contractions. Tg (pennogenin tetraglycoside) was identified as one of the active ingredients in TSSPs able to induce rat myometrial contractions. However, the mechanisms underlying the pharmacological actions on uterine activity have not been described clearly.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Limei Wang","Chao Jia","Zuyin Yu","Xiaolan Liu","Liping Kang","Yue Cong","Yajun Shan","Zhenhu Zhao","Baiping Ma","Yuwen Cong"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0051536","first_seen_on":"2012-12-13T00:04:38+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"12","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1355351269,"links":["http:\/\/feeds.plos.org\/~r\/plosone\/PLoSONE\/~3\/gXXQnZMolLI\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0051536"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0051536.pdf","pmid":"23251567","pubdate":"2012-12-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e51536","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Pennogenin Tetraglycoside Induces Rat Myometrial Contraction and MLC20 Phosphorylation via PLC-IP3 and RhoA\/Rho Kinase Signaling Pathways","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pennogenin-tetraglycoside-induces-rat-myometrial-contraction-mlc20-phosphorylation-via-plcip3-rhoarh"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631265,"mean":4.9266893682253,"rank":2898468,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":80663,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631265,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":276810,"mean":5.6900590154223,"rank":220213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1051,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":276810,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64101,"mean":8.2798234633386,"rank":50241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":310,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64101,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6473,"mean":6.1989446847961,"rank":4729,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6473,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Pennogenin Tetraglycoside Induces Rat Myometrial Contraction and MLC20 Phosphorylation via PLC-IP3 and RhoA\/Rho Kinase Signaling Pathways","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=476470355728305&id=173273506047993","citation_ids":[1121062],"posted_on":"2012-12-12T22:27:49+00:00","summary":"by Limei Wang, Chao Jia, Zuyin Yu, Xiaolan Liu, Liping Kang, Yue Cong, Yajun Shan, Zhenhu Zhao, Baiping Ma, Yuwen Cong Background Total steroidal saponins extracted from the rhizome of Paris polyphylla Sm. var. yunnanensis (TSSPs) have been widely used in","author":{"name":"Open Access","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/173273506047993","facebook_wall_name":"Open Access","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/173273506047993\/picture","id_on_source":"173273506047993"}}]}}
