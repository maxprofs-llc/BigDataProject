The objectives of this study were: 1) to describe a manual method for producing two kinds of PC in cats (PC-A and PC-B), 2) to describe the cellular population of the PC, 3) to measure and compare the effect of calcium gluconate (CG) and bovine thrombin (BT) on the temporal release of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21) and platelet-derived growth factor type BB (PDGF-BB) at 3 and 12 hours post-activation and 4) to establish correlations between the cellular population of both PCs and the concentration of growth factors (GF). Blood samples were taken from 16 cats for complete blood count, plasma collection and PC preparation. The PC were arbitrarily divided into two fractions, specifically, PC-A (lower fraction) and PC-B (upper fraction).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4cc3cf058f6100004b5","doi":"10.1186\/1746-6148-8-212","first_seen_on":"2012-12-12T21:47:58+00:00","issns":["1746-6148"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Veterinary Research","last_mentioned_on":1353085805,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1746-6148\/8\/212\/abstract"],"pmid":"23131192","pubdate":"2012-11-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Transgenics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Veterinary Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"startpage":"212","title":"Evaluation of the effect of calcium gluconate and bovine thrombin on the temporal release of transforming growth factor beta 1 and platelet-derived growth factor isoform BB from feline platelet concentrates","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-effect-calcium-gluconate-bovine-thrombin-temporal-release-transforming-growth-factor-beta"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628172,"mean":4.9437236464363,"rank":2904390,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75419,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628172,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":276562,"mean":5.7085257718912,"rank":220601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":613,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":276562,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":609,"mean":2.1644506578947,"rank":499,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":609,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":1.7389830508475,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
