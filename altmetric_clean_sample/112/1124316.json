These NREM oscillations play a crucial role in brain plasticity, and importantly, NREM sleep oscillations change considerably with aging. This review discusses the association between NREM sleep oscillations and cerebral plasticity as well as the functional impact of age-related changes on NREM sleep oscillations. We propose that age-related reduction in sleep-dependent memory consolidation may be due in part to changes in NREM sleep oscillations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc9c","authors":["Stuart Fogel","Nicolas Martin","Marjolaine Lafortune","Marc Barakat","Karen Debas","Samuel Laventure","V\u00e9ronique Latreille","Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gagnon","Julien Doyon","Julie Carrier"],"doi":"10.3389\/fneur.2012.00176","first_seen_on":"2012-12-14T13:02:53+00:00","issns":["1664-2295"],"journal":"Frontiers in Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1367273461,"links":["http:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/Sleep_and_Chronobiology\/10.3389\/fneur.2012.00176\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/DownloadFile\/1\/12052\/34346\/1\/21\/fneur-03-00176_pdf","pmid":"23248614","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"title":"NREM Sleep Oscillations and Brain Plasticity in Aging","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nrem-sleep-oscillations-brain-plasticity-aging"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":1989921,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2419673,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281474,"mean":5.9174694411187,"rank":114222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":158396,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281474,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":795,"mean":3.7606322418136,"rank":310,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":456,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":795,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185,"mean":3.3036304347826,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":22,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
