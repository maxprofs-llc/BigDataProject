In addition, decades of low income and labour market exclusion prohibit many Canadian immigrants from building adequate private pension savings throughout their working life. Together, these factors present serious concerns for immigrant seniors' economic well-being. Using Canadian census data spanning a twenty-year period (1991-2011), we find that income from personal savings plans and investments has declined sharply for both native-born and immigrant Canadians, with recent immigrant cohorts faring worst. However, since 1991, native-born and immigrant men living in Canada for 40-plus years had major gains in private employer pensions (Registered Pension Plans; [RPPs]). Yet RPP income for all other immigrant cohorts remained stable or declined during these decades. Thus, the data demonstrate a worrisome growing private savings gap between native-born men and all others in Canada, with newer immigrants and women faring worst.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000dc7","authors":["Josh Curtis","Naomi Lightman"],"doi":"10.1017\/s0714980817000083","first_seen_on":"2017-04-20T12:39:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0714-9808","1710-1107"],"journal":"Canadian Journal on Aging","last_mentioned_on":1494593180,"links":["https:\/\/www.cambridge.org\/core\/journals\/canadian-journal-on-aging-la-revue-canadienne-du-vieillissement\/article\/golden-years-or-retirement-fears-private-pension-inequality-among-canadas-immigrants\/7564E2BCC7362BBE6938A3F6C91771EC#.WPiqtidiv5g.twitter","https:\/\/www.cambridge.org\/core\/journals\/canadian-journal-on-aging-la-revue-canadienne-du-vieillissement\/article\/golden-years-or-retirement-fears-private-pension-inequality-among-canadas-immigrants\/7564E2BCC7362BBE6938A3F6C91771EC#.WRWieB2ehSE.twitter"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.cambridge.org\/core\/services\/aop-cambridge-core\/content\/view\/7564E2BCC7362BBE6938A3F6C91771EC\/S0714980817000083a.pdf\/div-class-title-golden-years-or-retirement-fears-private-pension-inequality-among-canada-s-immigrants-div.pdf","pmid":"28420453","pubdate":"2017-04-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Nursing","Social Sciences"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Golden Years or Retirement Fears?
