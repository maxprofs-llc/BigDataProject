Efforts to clarify genetic susceptibility and screening for environmental factors have identified the vitamin D system as a contributory pathway that is potentially correctable. This review aims at compiling all genetic studies addressing the vitamin D system in type 1 diabetes. Herein, association studies with case control cohorts are presented as well as family investigations with transmission tests, meta-analyses and intervention trials. Additionally, rare examples of inborn errors of vitamin D metabolism manifesting with type 1 diabetes and their immune status are discussed. We find a majority of association studies confirming a predisposing role for vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphisms and those of the vitamin D metabolism, particularly the CYP27B1 gene encoding the main enzyme for vitamin D activation. Associations, however, are tenuous in relation to the ethnic background of the studied populations. Intervention trials identify the specific requirements of adequate vitamin D doses to achieve vitamin D sufficiency. Preliminary evidence suggests that doses may need to be individualized in order to achieve target effects due to pharmacogenomic variation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90f3cf058f61000cc1b","authors":["Marissa Penna-Martinez","Klaus Badenhoop"],"doi":"10.3390\/genes8040125","first_seen_on":"2017-04-20T12:18:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2073-4425"],"issue":"4","journal":"Genes","last_mentioned_on":1494407166,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2073-4425\/8\/4\/125?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/mdpi.com\/2073-4425\/8\/4\/125","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/genes8040125"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2073-4425\/8\/4\/125\/pdf","pmid":"28425954","pubdate":"2017-04-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","title":"Inherited Variation in Vitamin D Genes and Type 1 Diabetes Predisposition","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inherited-variation-vitamin-d-genes-type-1-diabetes-predisposition"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8183022,"mean":6.92160443679,"rank":4100863,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3873576,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8183022,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237639,"mean":12.846136712142,"rank":121372,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":106125,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237639,"percentile":44},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":477,"mean":2.8850294117647,"rank":217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":224,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":477,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":2.8801886792453,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/P_Doggy_Bone\/statuses\/855023182327173120","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19204531],"posted_on":"2017-04-20T11:39:46+00:00","author":{"name":"Precious Daniel\u2122","url":"http:\/\/facebook.com\/precious.ogunleye","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/891043583511470080\/FfBKDjay_normal.jpg","description":"All I want is to be RICH and FAMOUS through God's blessings.
