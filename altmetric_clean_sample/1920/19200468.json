This study analyzed the whole genome sequences of one clinical isolate of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Haemophilus parasuis, Pasteurella multocida, and Bordetella bronchiseptica, all isolated from Australian pigs to identify the mechanism underlying the elevated minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for erythromycin, tilmicosin, or tulathromycin. The H. parasuis assembled genome had a nucleotide transition at position 2059 (A to G) in the six copies of the 23S rRNA gene. This mutation has previously been associated with macrolide resistance but this is the first reported mechanism associated with elevated macrolide MICs in H. parasuis. There was no known macrolide resistance mechanism identified in the other three bacterial genomes. However, strA and sul2, aminoglycoside and sulfonamide resistance genes, respectively, were detected in one contiguous sequence (contig 1) of A. pleuropneumoniae assembled genome. This contig was identical to plasmids previously identified in Pasteurellaceae. This study has provided one possible explanation of elevated MICs to macrolides in H. parasuis. Further studies are necessary to clarify the mechanism causing the unexplained macrolide resistance in other Australian pig respiratory pathogens including the role of efflux systems, which were detected in all analyzed genomes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5043cf058f6100030c2","authors":["Dayao, Denise Ann Estarez","Seddon, Jennifer M.","Gibson, Justine S.","Blackall, Patrick J.","Turni, Conny"],"doi":"10.1089\/mdr.2015.0214","first_seen_on":"2017-04-20T10:24:30+00:00","issns":["1076-6294","1931-8448"],"journal":"Microbial Drug Resistance: Mechanism, Epidemiology, & Disease","last_mentioned_on":1492692670,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26981707?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26981707","pubdate":"2016-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Mary Ann Liebert Inc","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Whole Genome Sequence Analysis of Pig Respiratory Bacterial Pathogens with Elevated Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations for Macrolides","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/whole-genome-sequence-analysis-pig-respiratory-bacterial-pathogens-elevated-minimum-inhibitory-conce"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8201165,"mean":6.939487556394,"rank":6227341,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1104144,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8201165,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238599,"mean":12.84006891927,"rank":169791,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":43647,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238599,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":398,"mean":2.0839445843829,"rank":234,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":84,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":398,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.0204545454545,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
