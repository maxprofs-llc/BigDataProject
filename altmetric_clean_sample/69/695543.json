It is performed using various surgical approaches (external, intraoral, bicoronal or their combination). The reduction technique that is the most effective, safest and with the lowest morbidity needs to be determined. From December 2005 to January 2010, 1652 patients who wanted to undergo zygoma reduction for purely aesthetic reasons were operated on using a novel technique that we have developed (the 3S technique), which is a simple and safe surgical technique that results in only a short scar. First, under local anaesthesia, a 13- to 15-mm-long skin incision is made at each sideburn. The subperiosteal dissection is continued anteriorly all the way to the body of the zygoma. Zygoma reduction is then performed in three steps: (1) malar shaving (lateral area of the zygoma body), (2) lateral corticotomy (zygomatic arch) and (3) full-thickness osteotomy (pretubercular area of the temporomandibular joint). Next, the zygomatic arch is displaced medially with digital pressure (infracture). Finally, a Silastic drain is inserted through the incision site, skin repair is completed and a gentle compressive dressing is applied. Most of the patients were satisfied with the results of the operation. This technique provides the following advantages: (1) it is simple and safe because it is performed under only local anaesthesia; (2) only one scar is created at the sideburn; (3) no foreign bodies, such as wires or miniplates, are used; and (4) it is minimally invasive, and as such there are fewer potential complications (e.g., no cheek drooping due to a wide muscle incision or dissection, less oedema and bleeding and a short hospitalisation time). The presented technique is simpler\u00a0and more effective than previously described surgical techniques for reduction malarplasty.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e00","doi":"10.1016\/j.bjps.2012.03.018","first_seen_on":"2012-04-13T12:31:59+00:00","issns":["1878-0539"],"journal":"Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (JPRAS)","last_mentioned_on":1334320264,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22495013?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22495013","pubdate":"2012-04-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Lateral facial contouring via a single preauricular incision.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lateral-facial-contouring-via-single-preauricular-incision"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628216,"mean":4.9435109727551,"rank":2904386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75422,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628216,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73864,"mean":4.1397720915749,"rank":53295,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":249,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73864,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":399,"mean":1.5920502512563,"rank":255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":399,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.935,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
