The extent that this factor limits training has not been totally defined. The purpose of this study was to compare the response to training of patients with moderate to severe COPD with that achieved by healthy elderly subjects who were exercising using an identical program.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a04","doi":"10.1097\/hcr.0b013e31824e16e4","first_seen_on":"2012-04-12T23:57:13+00:00","issns":["1932-7501"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation and prevention","last_mentioned_on":1336599234,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jcrjournal\/9000\/00000\/Effect_of_Exercise_Training_in_Patients_With.99874.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jcrjournal\/9000\/00000\/Effect_of_Exercise_Training_in_Patients_With.99874.pdf","pmid":"22487615","pubdate":"2012-04-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"","subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine","cardiology","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Effect of Exercise Training in Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Compared With Healthy Elderly Subjects","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-exercise-training-patients-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-compared-healthy-elderly-sub"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":3082613,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":965015,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76756,"mean":4.4784910689857,"rank":47478,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":16607,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76756,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":402,"mean":1.5129526184539,"rank":244,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":402,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.8214285714286,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
