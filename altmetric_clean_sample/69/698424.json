This study aims (i) to examine whether sleep disturbances and fatigue are independently related to the onset of register-based sickness absence of \u2265 3 weeks during a 1-year follow-up in a representative sample of the Danish workforce and (ii) to determine if possible associations are gender-specific.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002855","authors":["B\u00fcltmann U","Nielsen MB","Madsen IE","Burr H","Rugulies R","U.
