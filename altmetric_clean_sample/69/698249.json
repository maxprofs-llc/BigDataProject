Participants were 108 5- and 6-year-old preschoolers (54 children with DCD and 54 children without DCD). The Movement Assessment Battery for Children assessed motor function. Running speed and agility were measured using the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency. Finally, the Planning, Attention and Simultaneous Scales from the Das-Naglieri Cognitive Assessment System evaluated cognitive ability. Children with DCD differed significantly from those without DCD performing at a lower level on all motor and cognitive tasks. A correlation analysis revealed significant relationships between cognitive processes and motor skills. Simultaneous cognitive processing and manual dexterity were significantly correlated for both groups. Furthermore, a significant relationship was revealed between planning cognitive processing and balance for the non-DCD group. Thus, early assessment might identify specific cognitive-motor difficulties. Furthermore, early intervention might prevent some of the developmental comorbidities in the academic and everyday lives of children with movement difficulties.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003464","authors":["Katerina Asonitou","Dimitra Koutsouki","Thomas Kourtessis","Sofia Charitou"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ridd.2012.01.008","endpage":"1005","first_seen_on":"2012-04-15T21:37:27+00:00","issns":["08914222"],"issue":"4","journal":"Research in Developmental Disabilities","last_mentioned_on":1334525101,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0891422212000091"],"pmid":"22502823","pubdate":"2012-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Specialist Studies In Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"996","title":"Motor and cognitive performance differences between children with and without developmental coordination disorder (DCD)","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/motor-cognitive-performance-differences-between-children-without-developmental-coordination-disorder-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631967,"mean":4.9253635474614,"rank":2898440,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":81024,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631967,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74332,"mean":4.0893073952993,"rank":53156,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":356,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74332,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":868,"mean":2.372184544406,"rank":671,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":868,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":3.9733333333333,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":11,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Ph.
