Molecular solutions of these mono-, di-, and trihydroxyl substituted bile acids spontaneously evolved into supramolecular aggregates upon the incremental addition of H(2)O as a poor solvent. Highly crystalline nanostructured multilayered assemblies were formed, which revealed a very rich polymorphism of micro- and macro-structures depending on the chemical structure of the bile acid and the properties of the cosolvent (EtOH or DMSO) used. In particular, AFM allowed resolving the crystalline structure to an unprecedented level. It was thus possible to establish that bile acids associate into H-bonded chiral dimer building blocks, which organize in 2D layers of nanostructured lamellar surface topologies with unique facial amphiphilicity. The detailed understanding of the hierarchical organization in bile acid assemblies may contribute to develop strategies to design bioinspired materials with tailor-made nanostructured surface topologies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fd3","authors":["Larissa Schefer","Antoni S\u00e1nchez-Ferrer","Jozef Adamcik","Raffaele Mezzenga"],"doi":"10.1021\/la300384u","endpage":"6005","first_seen_on":"2012-04-10T13:58:18+00:00","issns":["0743-7463","1520-5827"],"issue":"14","journal":"Langmuir","last_mentioned_on":1334065861,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/la300384u"],"pmid":"22414270","pubdate":"2012-04-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"5999","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Resolving Self-Assembly of Bile Acids at the Molecular Length Scale","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/resolving-selfassembly-bile-acids-molecular-length-scale"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7205422,"mean":6.3461067285278,"rank":5422924,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":993007,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7205422,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91192,"mean":5.0088002105471,"rank":58133,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":16969,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91192,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2565,"mean":2.8561450858034,"rank":1422,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":730,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2565,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":3.2805714285714,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
