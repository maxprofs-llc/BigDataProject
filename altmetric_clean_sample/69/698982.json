However recent evidence suggests that a limited degree of plasticity remains after this period and well into adulthood. Here, we ask the question, \"what limits the degree of plasticity in adulthood?\" Although this limit has been assumed to be due to neural factors, we show that the optical quality of the retinal image ultimately limits the brain potential for change. We correct the high-order aberrations (HOAs) normally present in the eye's optics using adaptive optics, and reveal a greater degree of neuronal plasticity than previously appreciated.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012NatSR...2E.364Z","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Jiawei Zhou","Yudong Zhang","Yun Dai","Haoxin Zhao","Rong Liu","Fang Hou","Bo Liang","Robert F.
