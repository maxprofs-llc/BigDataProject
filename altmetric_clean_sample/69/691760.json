This debate has previously been merely speculative because of the lack of studies comparing the burn-out risk of the German working population with anesthetists. Accordingly it was not certain whether anesthetists really are at greater risk of developing burnout as has often been suggested. Moreover, age, gender, function, workplace environment, e.g. working at a hospital compared to a general practitioner (GP) surgery, may influence the risk of burnout. Therefore, this study examined whether the risk for anesthetists in Germany suffering from burnout really is greater than in other occupations. In addition, factors influencing the burnout risks of anesthetists were analyzed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4cc3cf058f610000481","authors":["Heinke W","Dunkel P","Br\u00e4hler E","N\u00fcbling M","Riedel-Heller S","Kaisers UX"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00101-011-1947-3","first_seen_on":"2012-04-11T10:21:30+00:00","issns":["0003-2417"],"issue":"","journal":"Anaesthesist","last_mentioned_on":1334139401,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22071874?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22071874","pubdate":"2011-11-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["anesthesiology"],"title":"[Burnout in anesthesiology and intensive care : Is there a problem in Germany?]","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/burnout-der-an%C3%A4sthesie-und-intensivmedizin-gibt-es-ein-problem-deutschland"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626769,"mean":4.9522514062143,"rank":2907348,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":73042,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626769,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73702,"mean":4.1913847030569,"rank":53365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":203,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73702,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238,"mean":1.2387172995781,"rank":117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.80909090909091,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
