Critically ill patients frequently require anticoagulant (AC) and antiplatelet (AP) therapies for myriad indications. There are no societal guidelines proffering strategies to manage AC\/AP therapies periprocedurally for bedside PEG or PDT. The aim of this study is to evaluate the management of AC\/AP therapies around PEG\/PDT, assess periprocedural bleeding complications, and identify risk factors associated with bleeding.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"5523eeb22a83ee005f8b4573","doi":"10.1097\/ta.0b013e31824fbadf","first_seen_on":"2012-04-11T17:17:58+00:00","issns":["2163-0755"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery, The","last_mentioned_on":1340878384,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jtrauma\/Abstract\/2012\/04000\/Anticoagulation_management_around_percutaneous.2.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jtrauma\/2012\/04000\/Anticoagulation_management_around_percutaneous.2.pdf","pmid":"22491591","pubdate":"2012-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"815","title":"Anticoagulation management around percutaneous bedside procedures:  Is adjustment required?","type":"article","volume":"72","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/anticoagulation-management-around-percutaneous-bedside-procedures"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4770545,"mean":5.7208170586012,"rank":3190771,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1391551,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4770545,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77587,"mean":4.7161992627536,"rank":45270,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":28807,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77587,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1896,"mean":5.046655408971,"rank":1393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":418,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1896,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111,"mean":1.2727636363636,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":61,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
