However, there is debate on the introduction of anti-TNF agents earlier in the treatment strategy (top-down) to potentially improve clinical outcomes. The aim of this study was to determine if a top-down approach with anti-TNF therapy is associated with improved outcomes for patients with active CD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f610007774","authors":["Rubin DT","Uluscu O","Sederman R"],"doi":"10.1002\/ibd.22925","endpage":"2231","first_seen_on":"2012-04-16T17:17:57+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1536-4844","1078-0998"],"issue":"12","journal":"Inflammatory Bowel Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1438731161,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ibd.22925\/abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/ibd.22925","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/22359399\/?i=7&from=rubin%20dt%20anti%20tnf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ibd.22925\/pdf","pmid":"22359399","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"2225","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Response to biologic therapy in Crohn's disease is improved with early treatment: An analysis of health claims data.","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/response-biologic-therapy-crohns-disease-improved-early-treatment-analysis-health-claims-data"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.172,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.172},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5441926,"mean":6.3368881750487,"rank":609377,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":4832631,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5441926,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72533,"mean":5.0760970330336,"rank":7503,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":65030,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72533,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1310,"mean":2.9766936592819,"rank":83,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":1227,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1310,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":1.8439285714286,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
