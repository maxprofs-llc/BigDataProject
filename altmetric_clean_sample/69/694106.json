But this analysis does not account for the increasing independence of the two performances as training continues or for increases in control by dimensions of a stimulus other than the one used in training. Correlation of stimuli with different densities of reinforcement produces an increase in the behavior necessary to observe them, and greater observing of and attending to the relevant stimuli may account for the increase in control by these stimuli. The observing analysis also encompasses errorless training, and the selective nature of observing explains the feature-positive effect and the relatively shallow gradients of generalization generated by negative discriminative stimuli. The effectiveness of the observing analysis in handling these special cases adds to the converging lines of evidence supporting its integrative power and thus its validity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f66","authors":["J A Dinsmoor"],"doi":"10.1901\/jeab.1985.43-365","first_seen_on":"2012-04-12T16:07:03+00:00","issns":["0022-5002"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1334221980,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1348149\/pdf\/jeabehav00052-0082.pdf"],"pdf_url":"\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1348149\/pdf\/jeabehav00052-0082.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1348149","pmid":"3894561","pubdate":"1985-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"365","subjects":["behavioralsciences"],"title":"The role of observing and attention in establishing stimulus control.","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-observing-attention-establishing-stimulus-control"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627006,"mean":4.9509722374284,"rank":2907059,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":73325,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627006,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73906,"mean":4.1925034842026,"rank":53481,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":215,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73906,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237,"mean":3.1433813559322,"rank":195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.75,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
