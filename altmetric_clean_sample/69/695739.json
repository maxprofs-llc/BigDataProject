These GTPases undergo a spatiotemporal regulation primarily controlled by cellular factors inducing both the exchange of GDP for GTP and the hydrolysis of GTP into GDP. Recent findings have unveiled another layer of complexity in the regulation of Rho proteins consisting in their ubiquitylation followed by their proteasomal degradation. Here, we describe how to assess the level of ubiquitylation of Rho proteins in cells, taking Rac1 as an example.","abstract_source":"pubmed","doi":"10.1007\/978-1-61779-442-1_5","first_seen_on":"2012-04-13T14:36:07+00:00","issns":[],"last_mentioned_on":1350067005,"links":["http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/content\/q260560n401u9469\/#section=999796&page=1"],"pmid":"22144268","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Rho GTPases","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/assessing-ubiquitylation-rho-gtpases-mammalian-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/LifeSensorsInc\/statuses\/223850993601884160","license":"public","citation_ids":[695739],"posted_on":"2012-07-13T18:46:50+00:00","author":{"name":"LifeSensors Inc.","url":"http:\/\/www.lifesensors.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3120931307\/e7225bce1da7977cfc122a0a444f0fbc_normal.jpeg","description":"Developer of novel tech using #SUMOfusion to overcome bottlenecks in protein production; Producer of tools to study #Ubiquitin #Proteasome Pathway #biotech","id_on_source":"LifeSensorsInc","tweeter_id":"102733051","geo":{"lt":"40.036202","ln":"-75.5138959","country":"US"},"followers":262},"tweet_id":"223850993601884160"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/UbConf2012\/status\/190809780649078784","citation_ids":[695739],"posted_on":"2012-04-13T14:32:51+00:00","author":{"name":"Ubiquitin Conference","url":"http:\/\/www.ubiquitinconference.com","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1783418899\/ubconf2012_normal.PNG","description":"The Premier Conference in the Ubiquitin Field Hosts an Exciting Cast of #Ubiquitin-Focused Professionals from Academic, #Pharma, #Biotech & Business Communities","id_on_source":"UbConf2012","tweeter_id":"273628368","geo":{"lt":39.95228,"ln":-75.162454,"country":"US"},"followers":148},"tweet_id":"190809780649078784"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/LifeSensorsInc\/statuses\/256825752425730050","license":"public","citation_ids":[695739],"posted_on":"2012-10-12T18:36:45+00:00","author":{"name":"LifeSensors Inc.","url":"http:\/\/www.lifesensors.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3120931307\/e7225bce1da7977cfc122a0a444f0fbc_normal.jpeg","description":"Developer of novel tech using #SUMOfusion to overcome bottlenecks in protein production; Producer of tools to study #Ubiquitin #Proteasome Pathway #biotech","id_on_source":"LifeSensorsInc","tweeter_id":"102733051","geo":{"lt":"40.036202","ln":"-75.5138959","country":"US"},"followers":262},"tweet_id":"256825752425730050"}]}}
