This paper discusses this, with particular reference to null hypothesis significance testing and the associated p-value. It concludes that the assumptions behind these tests are too stringent for most undergraduate nursing students, and this, alongside the poor understanding of their meaning means that their teaching should have a limited place in the curriculum, which should instead concentrate upon exploratory analysis and understanding measures of effect.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b83","authors":["Edward Purssell","Alison While"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.nedt.2010.11.017","endpage":"840","first_seen_on":"2012-04-12T23:00:39+00:00","issns":["02606917"],"issue":"8","journal":"Nurse Education Today","last_mentioned_on":1334271054,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0260691710002431"],"pmid":"21126810","pubdate":"2011-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"837","title":"P=nothing, or why we should not teach healthcare students about statistics","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pnothing-we-not-teach-healthcare-students-about-statistics"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3076885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":955593,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76757,"mean":4.5105364271197,"rank":47427,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":16097,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76757,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":561,"mean":2.1138785714286,"rank":379,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":561,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.0923076923077,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
