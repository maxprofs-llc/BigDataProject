Tumor-derived factors may alter the differentiation capacity of the adjacent stromal cells. The aim of this study was to elucidate the paracrine impact of liposarcoma cells on pre-adipocytes, their adipogenic differentiation process and miRNA expression profile.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a66","authors":["Tilkorn DJ","Al-Benna S","Hauser J","Ring A","Steinau HU","Tannapfel A","Stricker I"],"first_seen_on":"2012-04-14T11:06:53+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"4","journal":"Anticancer Research: International Journal of Cancer Research and Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1334401413,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22493346?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22493346","pubdate":"2012-04-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Sarcoma cells induce alteration in adipogenic differentiation.","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sarcoma-cells-induce-alteration-adipogenic-differentiation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4508238,"mean":5.1674528195662,"rank":3028764,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":924338,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4508238,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76785,"mean":4.5249662950614,"rank":47299,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":14720,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76785,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1276,"mean":2.4938807843137,"rank":632,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":430,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1276,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":1.1575,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
