Influenza vaccination in children has been shown to be safe and effective, but in 2010 the pediatric influenza vaccination program was suspended in Western Australia after the rate of febrile convulsions observed (9\/1000 doses) was 55 times the previously reported rate. In 2009, over 80% of all children in New Brunswick were vaccinated with an adjuvanted monovalent H1N1 vaccine shown to have very high effectiveness, raising the prospect of potential hyper-responsiveness because of residual protection. We conducted enhanced post-marketing surveillance to monitor local and general reactions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5263cf058f610003da1","authors":["Van Buynder, Paul G.","Frosst, Gillian","Van Buynder, Jan L.","Tremblay, Francios\u2010William","Ross, Alie","Jardine, Claire","Fei, Bao Gang"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1750-2659.2012.00364.x","endpage":"190","first_seen_on":"2012-04-13T20:14:25+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1750-2659","1750-2640"],"issue":"2","journal":"Influenza & Other Respiratory Viruses","last_mentioned_on":1335873127,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/j.1750-2659.2012.00364.x","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111%2Fj.1750-2659.2012.00364.x","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1750-2659.2012.00364.x\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1750-2659.2012.00364.x\/pdf","pmid":"22498052","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"184","title":"Increased reactions to pediatric influenza vaccination following concomitant pneumococcal vaccination","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increased-reactions-pediatric-influenza-vaccination-following-concomitant-pneumococcal-vaccination"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6591263,"mean":6.1165266287395,"rank":2227267,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":4341087,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6591263,"percentile":65},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84491,"mean":4.9548924606462,"rank":23849,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":60380,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84491,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":530,"mean":3.0801398865784,"rank":124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":406,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":530,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.75,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
