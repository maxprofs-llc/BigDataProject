Meta-awareness and regulation of mind-wandering are core cognitive components of most contemplative practices and to study their impact on DMN activity, we collected functional MRI (fMRI) data from a cohort of experienced Zen meditators and meditation-naive controls engaging in a basic attention-to-breathing protocol. We observed a significant group difference in the skewness of the fMRI BOLD signal from the vPMC, suggesting that the relative incidence of states of elevated vPMC activity was lower in meditators; furthermore, the same parameter was significantly correlated with performance on a rapid visual information processing (RVIP) test for sustained attention conducted outside the scanner. Finally, a functional connectivity analysis with the vPMC seed revealed a significant association of RVIP performance with the degree of temporal correlation between vPMC and the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ), a region strongly implicated in stimulus-triggered reorienting of attention. Together, these findings suggest that the vPMC BOLD signal skewness and the temporal relationship of vPMC and TPJ activities reflect the dynamic tension between mind-wandering, meta-awareness, and directed attention, and may represent a useful endophenotype for studying individual differences in attentional abilities and the impairment of the latter in specific clinical conditions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e79","authors":["Giuseppe Pagnoni"],"doi":"10.1523\/jneurosci.4135-11.2012","first_seen_on":"2012-04-11T20:18:13+00:00","issns":["1529-2401"],"issue":"15","journal":"Journal of Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1379784969,"links":["http:\/\/www.jneurosci.org\/content\/32\/15\/5242.short?rss=1","http:\/\/m.jneurosci.org\/content\/32\/15\/5242.abstract?sid=7f322926-1b6c-41c0-b1c2-80747cce833e"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jneurosci.org\/content\/32\/15\/5242.full.pdf","pmid":"22496570","pubdate":"2012-04-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Society for Neuroscience","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"5242","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Dynamical Properties of BOLD Activity from the Ventral Posteromedial Cortex Associated with Meditation and Attentional Skills","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dynamical-properties-bold-activity-ventral-posteromedial-cortex-associated-meditation-attentional-sk"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8220193,"mean":6.9627308157704,"rank":2072043,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":6128572,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8220193,"percentile":74},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94615,"mean":5.355045912867,"rank":22736,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":71689,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94615,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12423,"mean":10.002927869908,"rank":4935,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":7456,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12423,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":301,"mean":5.06158,"rank":92,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":208,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":301,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":11,"Researcher":39,"Student  > Doctoral Student":15,"Student  > Ph.
