However, surgery is occasionally indicated for cases with single-station N2 disease or within multimodal treatment regimens, and in clinical trials. The aim of this study is to evaluate surgical outcomes in a modern cohort of patients with clinical (c-) stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC whose nodal metastasis was confirmed by pathology (cN2\/pN2).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007efc","doi":"10.1097\/jto.0b013e31824c945b","first_seen_on":"2012-04-14T09:18:33+00:00","issns":["1556-0864"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Thoracic Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1335614954,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jto\/9000\/00000\/Surgical_Outcome_of_Stage_IIIA__cN2_pN2.99337.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jto\/9000\/00000\/Surgical_Outcome_of_Stage_IIIA__cN2_pN2.99337.pdf","pmid":"22481238","pubdate":"2012-04-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"","subjects":["neoplasms","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Surgical Outcome of Stage IIIA- cN2\/pN2 Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Patients in Japanese Lung Cancer Registry Study in 2004","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/surgical-outcome-stage-iiia-cn2pn2-nonsmallcell-lung-cancer-patients-japanese-lung-cancer-registry-s"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4770545,"mean":5.7208170586012,"rank":3378933,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":777543,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4770545,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77798,"mean":4.6754199262182,"rank":48908,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":13571,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77798,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1700,"mean":3.2138763978811,"rank":951,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1700,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86,"mean":0.86901176470588,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
