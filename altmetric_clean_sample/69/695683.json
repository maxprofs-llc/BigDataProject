Our numerical findings confirm such a change of order, but the value of the tilt angle at which it occurs, \u03b1* \u2248 45\u00b0, is considerably smaller than the original theoretical prediction. We critically reassess this work, which was based on allowing for the self-interaction of the fluid interface, and argue that the interfacial curvature and effective wavevector dependent surface tension can further lower the predicted value of \u03b1*, in keeping with our numerical findings. Interfacial fluctuation effects, occurring beyond mean-field level, are also discussed using effective Hamiltonian theory and are shown to substantially increase the value of \u03b1*.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012JPCM...24r2202B","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007df0","authors":["N R Bernardino","A O Parry","J M Romero-Enrique"],"doi":"10.1088\/0953-8984\/24\/18\/182202","first_seen_on":"2012-04-13T14:01:11+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["0953-8984","1361-648X"],"issue":"18","journal":"Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter","last_mentioned_on":1334325421,"links":["http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/0953-8984\/24\/18\/182202?utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/0953-8984\/24\/18\/182202?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/0953-8984\/24\/18\/182202\/pdf\/0953-8984_24_18_182202.pdf","pmid":"22498809","pubdate":"2012-04-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"IOP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Condensed Matter Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Materials Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"startpage":"182202","subjects":["biophysics","nanotechnology"],"title":"The order of filling transitions in acute wedges","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/order-filling-transitions-acute-wedges"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6427587,"mean":5.8881981586857,"rank":5474843,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6427587,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83275,"mean":4.8979058769844,"rank":68030,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83275,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":951,"mean":2.2999494736842,"rank":675,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":951,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":0.93225641025641,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/BlackPhysicists\/status\/190800762081783809","citation_ids":[695683],"posted_on":"2012-04-13T13:57:01+00:00","author":{"name":"BlackPhysicists","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/502208695854313472\/mupwPlOC_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"BlackPhysicists","tweeter_id":"46854930","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":16363},"tweet_id":"190800762081783809"}]}}
