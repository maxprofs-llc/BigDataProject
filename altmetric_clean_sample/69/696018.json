What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Patient-reported quality of life (QoL) in prostate cancer is recognized as an important outcome, and has been shown in multiple studies to capture the incidence and timing of patient symptoms more accurately than physician-graded toxicity reports. Although the long-term QoL after completing radiation therapy (RT) has been previously studied, patient experience during RT is not well described in the literature. The present study collected patient-reported QoL during RT in a prospective phase II clinical trial. The study describes in detail the time course and severity of gastrointestinal and genitourinary symptoms during radiation, providing clinically useful information for patients and physicians considering RT during the treatment decision-making process.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000245a","authors":["Chen, Ronald C.","Zhang, Yuanye","Chen, Ming\u2010Hui","McMahon, Elizabeth","Loffredo, Marian","McPherson, Carol P.","Nguyen, Angela U.","Nguyen, Paul L.","D'Amico, Anthony V."],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1464-410x.2012.11117.x","endpage":"1695","first_seen_on":"2012-04-13T18:16:48+00:00","issns":["1464-410X","1464-4096"],"issue":"11","journal":"British Journal of Urology","last_mentioned_on":1334340882,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/j.1464-410X.2012.11117.x","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1464-410X.2012.11117.x"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1464-410X.2012.11117.x\/pdf","pmid":"22502770","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1690","title":"Patient\u2010reported quality of life during radiation treatment for localized prostate cancer: results from a prospective phase II trial","type":"article","volume":"110","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/patientreported-quality-life-during-radiation-treatment-localized-prostate-cancer-results-prospectiv-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8163518,"mean":6.8970466082141,"rank":6203563,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1094962,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8163518,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94463,"mean":5.2791688721391,"rank":61374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":17005,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94463,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3064,"mean":6.4715337904016,"rank":2493,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":313,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3064,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71,"mean":2.5721428571429,"rank":54,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
