Here we describe a method for converting the >10(7) flow cell-bound clusters of identical DNA strands generated by the Illumina DNA sequencing technology into clusters of complementary RNA, and subsequently peptide clusters. We modified the flow-cell-bound primers with ribonucleotides thus enabling them to be used by poliovirus polymerase 3D(pol) . The primers hybridize to the clustered DNA thus leading to RNA clusters. The RNAs fold into functional protein- or small molecule-binding aptamers. We used the mRNA-display approach to synthesize flow-cell-tethered peptides from these RNA clusters. The peptides showed selective binding to cognate antibodies. The methods described here provide an approach for using DNA clusters to template peptide synthesis on an Illumina flow cell, thus providing new opportunities for massively parallel peptide-based assays.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008dd9","authors":["Svensen, Nina","Peersen, Olve B.","Jaffrey, Samie R.","Peersen, Olve B","Jaffrey, Samie R"],"doi":"10.1002\/cbic.201600298","endpage":"1635","first_seen_on":"2016-07-06T19:40:09+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1439-7633"],"issue":"17","journal":"ChemBioChem","last_mentioned_on":1482342195,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/cbic.201600298","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/cbic.201600298?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/cbic.201600298"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cbic.201600298\/pdf","pmid":"27385640","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1628","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Peptide Synthesis on a Next\u2010Generation DNA Sequencing Platform","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/peptide-synthesis-nextgeneration-dna-sequencing-platform"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.85,"score_history":{"1y":11.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7917108,"mean":6.6979661075636,"rank":656232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7258863,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7917108,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259149,"mean":11.51208654514,"rank":31983,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":227055,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259149,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1984,"mean":2.4135037821483,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":1957,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1984,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97,"mean":1.31875,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":96,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97,"percentile":98}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
