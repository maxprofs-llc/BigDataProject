However, sexually dimorphic traits and the underlying sexually dimorphic gene expression patterns are often rapidly evolving. We explore this apparent paradox by measuring the genetic correlation in gene expression between males and females (Cmf) across broad evolutionary timescales, using two RNA-sequencing data sets spanning multiple populations and multiple species. We find that unbiased genes have higher Cmf than sex-biased genes, consistent with intersexual genetic correlations constraining the evolution of sexual dimorphism. However, we found that highly sex-biased genes (both male and female biased) also had higher tissue specificity, and unbiased genes had greater expression breadth, suggesting that pleiotropy may constrain the breakdown of intersexual genetic correlations. Finally, we show that genes with high Cmf showed some degree of sex-specific changes in gene expression in males and females. Together, our results suggest that genetic correlations between males and females may be less important in constraining the evolution of sex-biased gene expression than pleiotropy. Sex-specific regulatory variation and tissue specificity may resolve the paradox of widespread sex bias within a largely shared genome.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000222c","authors":["Rebecca Dean","Dean, Rebecca","Mank, Judith E"],"doi":"10.1086\/687526","endpage":"E000","first_seen_on":"2016-07-06T21:38:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0003-0147","1537-5323"],"issue":"3","journal":"American Naturalist","last_mentioned_on":1471047120,"links":["http:\/\/www.journals.uchicago.edu\/doi\/abs\/10.1086\/687526","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27501094?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27501094?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27501094\/"],"pmid":"27501094","pubdate":"2016-07-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"E000","subjects":["science","biology"],"title":"Tissue Specificity and Sex-Specific Regulatory Variation Permits the Evolution of Sex-Biased Gene Expression","type":"article","volume":"188","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tissue-specificity-sexspecific-regulatory-variation-permit-evolution-sexbiased-gene-expression"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8424967,"mean":7.0869119322179,"rank":1378888,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":7041821,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8424967,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263272,"mean":11.702007338445,"rank":59240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":203812,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263272,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2168,"mean":8.7436714351638,"rank":567,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":1598,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2168,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":24.251511111111,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":6,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":6,"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
