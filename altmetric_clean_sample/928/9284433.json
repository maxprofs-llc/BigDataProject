Data for this study were obtained from the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health (CCHS-MH). A sample of 8126 respondents aged 20-69 years old who experienced at least one child maltreatment event was analyzed using binary logistic regression with severe psychological distress as the outcome variable. Of the 8126 respondents with a history of child maltreatment, 3.9% experienced severe psychological distress within the past month. Results from the multivariate logistic regression revealed that emotional and psychological well-being each had a significant effect on severe psychological distress. For each unit increase in emotional well-being, the odds of a respondent having severe psychological distress were predicted to decrease by a factor of 28% and for each unit increase in psychological well-being, the odds of a respondent having severe psychological distress were predicted to decrease by a factor of 10%, net the effect of demographic, socioeconomic, and health factors. Other factors associated with psychological distress included: younger age, poor self-perceived physical health, and chronic condition. Having post-secondary education, having a higher income, and being non-White predicted lower odds of severe psychological distress. Although, child maltreatment is associated with stressful life events later in adulthood, subjective well-being could serve as a protective factor against severe psychological distress among adults who experienced maltreatment when they were children.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002502","authors":["Baiden, Philip","Tarshis, Sarah","Antwi-Boasiako, Kofi","den Dunnen, Wendy"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.chiabu.2016.06.017","endpage":"140","first_seen_on":"2016-07-07T00:50:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-7757","01452134"],"journal":"Child Abuse & Neglect","last_mentioned_on":1476735187,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27372801\/?i=50&from=email","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0145213416301144&_version=1&md5=f4d3ded776c6157bc090abcf2c2b6db9"],"pmid":"27372801","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Social Work","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"129","subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Examining the independent protective effect of subjective well-being on severe psychological distress among Canadian adults with a history of child maltreatment","type":"article","volume":"58","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/examining-independent-protective-effect-subjective-wellbeing-severe-psychological-distress-among-can"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8231858,"mean":6.9724784662742,"rank":4378514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2286199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8231858,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261493,"mean":11.666245751304,"rank":141546,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":94869,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261493,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1675,"mean":6.0981911589008,"rank":1358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":208,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1675,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":5.3633333333333,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
