Their structures were established on the basis of spectroscopic techniques. The structure of compound 2 was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Triterpenes 1 and 4-6 showed cytotoxicity against the NCI-H187 cell line with IC50 values of 31.5, 28.5, 16.2, and 4.0\u2009\u00b5M, respectively. However, these compounds also showed cytotoxicity against Vero cells, with IC50 values of 75.5, 16.6, 8.9, and 5.0\u2009\u00b5M, respectively. In addition, compound 6 exhibited a moderate antimalarial activity with an IC50 value of 4.5\u2009\u00b5M.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003341","authors":["Pornwimon Lomchid","Pitak Nasomjai","Somdej Kanokmedhakul","Jaursup Boonmak","Sujittra Youngme","Kwanjai Kanokmedhakul"],"doi":"10.1055\/s-0042-116438","first_seen_on":"2017-06-22T20:20:19+00:00","issns":["0032-0943","1439-0221"],"journal":"Planta Medica","last_mentioned_on":1498162806,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27617903?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27617903","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["botany"],"title":"Bioactive Lupane and Hopane Triterpenes from Lepisanthes senegalensis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bioactive-lupane-hopane-triterpenes-lepisanthes-senegalensis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":7267961,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236991,"mean":12.951387813832,"rank":193948,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236991,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":994,"mean":3.9120684793555,"rank":763,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":994,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.1,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
