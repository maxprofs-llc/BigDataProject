This study was based on the Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge Abstract database and the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System. Clinical diagnoses and interventions and resource intensity weights (RIW) were extracted. Hospital costs were estimated by multiplying cost per weighted case (CPWC) calculated at the national level with respective RIWs.\nOver four years, there were 34 346 cases of surgery or inpatient admission for chronic pelvic pain amounting to $100.5 million with an average cost of $25 million per year. Pelvic and perineal pain accounted for 61.5% (n\u00a0= 21 127) of the cases, while dysmenorrhea accounted for 31.8% (n\u00a0= 10 936), and dyspareunia accounted for 6.6% (n\u00a0= 2283). The vast majority of the cases (92.9%, n\u00a0= 31 923) were associated with surgical interventions, with the most common surgeries being hysterectomy (47.1%, n\u00a0=\u00a016 189), followed by laparoscopy (25.8%, n\u00a0= 8850), adnexal surgery (6.8%, n\u00a0= 2349), and other procedures (11.6%, n\u00a0= 3968).\nWhile these estimates do not take into account non-hospital related costs, such as outpatient treatment, loss of productivity, and impact on quality of life, this study demonstrates that chronic pelvic pain represents a considerable economic burden to Canada's health care system.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9283cf058f61000dd2c","authors":["Innie Chen","Kednapa Thavorn","Minxue Shen","Yvette Goddard","Paul Yong","George S.
