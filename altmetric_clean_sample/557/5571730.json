Although both medical and endovascular treatments are useful and suitable, few studies have investigated the continued use of indirect encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS) bypass in non-moyamoya ischemic patients. Herein, the authors retrospectively investigate clinical features, surgical treatments, and medium-term outcomes of indirect revascularization for non-moyamoya patients with anterior circulation arterial steno-occlusion in China.\nFifty-one adult patients with cerebral ischemic events and diagnosed non-moyamoya anterior circulation arterial steno-occlusion were treated by EDAS without burr holes. Preoperative, postoperative, and follow-up neurological statuses were evaluated using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS); angiogram and perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (PWI) changes were evaluated.\nForty-eight patients underwent unilateral EDAS, 3 underwent bilateral EDAS, 4 experienced complications prior to hospital discharge, and only 23 underwent follow-up angiograms. Of the 51 patients, 44 (86.3%) exhibited improved muscle strength; 21 of 23 patients (91.3%) with follow-up angiography data exhibited evidence of new visible branches from the superficial temporal artery (STA) and\/or middle meningeal artery (MMA). Pre- and post-operative PWI was performed for 5 patients; despite clinical improvement in all, only 2 exhibited hemodynamic improvement.\nIndirect revascularization may be safe and effective for improving blood flow to the ischemic region following non-moyamoya anterior circulation arterial steno-occlusion, especially in patients with residual post-infarction neurological deficits. Our study demonstrates that improvements in ischemic symptoms after EDAS correspond to neovascularization from the STA and\/or MMA in ischemic brain areas.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d13","authors":["Tong, Huaiyu","Ma, Yudong","Zhang, Zhiyuan","Mao, Zhiqi","Yao, Baojun","Shang, Aijia","Liu, Ruozhuo","Zhou, Dingbiao"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.wneu.2016.02.012","first_seen_on":"2016-02-14T10:23:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1878-8750"],"journal":"World Neurosurgery","last_mentioned_on":1455445369,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26872520"],"pmid":"26872520","pubdate":"2016-02-14T22:00:53+00:00","subjects":["neurosurgery"],"title":"Indirect revascularization for non-moyamoya anterior circulation arterial steno-occlusion: clinical features, surgical treatment, and medium-term o..","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/indirect-revascularization-nonmoyamoya-disease-anterior-circulation-arterial-stenoocclusion-clinical"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7191979,"mean":6.3236280124852,"rank":6199241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7191979,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":321210,"mean":9.69285888627,"rank":267229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":321210,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":748,"mean":2.4385033467202,"rank":539,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":748,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108,"mean":2.0845420560748,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Neuroscience":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/drtars\/statuses\/698814645252055040","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5571730],"posted_on":"2016-02-14T10:22:49+00:00","author":{"name":"Tars the Robot","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_6_normal.png","id_on_source":"drtars","tweeter_id":"3982165613","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":10},"tweet_id":"698814645252055040"}]}}
