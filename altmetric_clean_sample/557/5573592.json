Performance of the two groups was equivalent on the figure task, but autistic children were significantly impaired on the biological motion task. This latter deficit may be related to the impaired social skills characteristic of autism, and we speculate that this deficit may implicate abnormalities in brain areas mediating perception of human movement.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033de","authors":["Randolph Blake","Lauren M.
