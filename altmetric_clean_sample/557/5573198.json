Hierarchical regressions investigated the predictive relationship between SO language and clients' post-treatment drinking behavior. A cohort analytic design compared the change language of these SO-involved participants against a matched group who chose client-only therapy.\n'SO Support Change' language increased the odds of client Change Talk in the next utterance (p<.01). SO Support Change did not significantly predict reduced post-treatment drinking, whereas 'SO Against Change' significantly predicted an increase in average drinks per drinking day (DDD) across months 7-9 post-MET (p=.04). In the matched comparison, the proportion of change-related client language was comparable across the SO-involved and client-only groups.\nMotivational interviewing theory was supported by the sequential association between SO and client language as well as the predictive link between SO Against Change and client drinking intensity. Given the centrality of pro-sobriety language in the literature, it was surprising that SO Support Change did not predict alcohol use outcomes. Findings are discussed in relation to contemporary treatment process research and clinical practice.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f45","authors":["Emilie Bourke","Molly Magill","Timothy R.
