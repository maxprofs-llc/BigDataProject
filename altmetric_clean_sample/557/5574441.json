Hence drugs those perturb these process are considered to be effective in killing fast multiplying cancer cells. There is a collection of natural compounds which disturb microtubule\/tubulin dis\/assemblage and there have been a lot of efforts concerted in the marine realm too, to surveying such killer molecules. Close to half the natural compounds shooting out from marine invertebrates are generally with no traceable definite mechanisms of action though may be tough anti-cancerous hits at nanogram levels, hence fatefully those discoveries conclude therein without a capacity of translation from laboratory to pharmacy. Astoundingly at least 50% of natural compounds which have definite mechanisms of action causing disorders in tubulin\/microtubule kinetics have an isolation history from sponges belonging to the Phylum: Porifera. Poriferans have always been a wonder worker to treat cancers with a choice of, yet precise targets on cancerous tissues. There is a specific order: Dictyoceratida within this Phylum which has contributed to yielding at least 50% of effective compounds possessing this unique mechanism of action mentioned above. However, not much notice is driven to Dictyoceratidans alongside the order: Demospongiae thus dictating the need to know its select microtubule\/tubulin irritants since the unearthing of avarol in the year 1974 till date. Hence this review selectively pinpoints all the compounds, noteworthy derivatives and analogs stemming from order: Dictyoceratida focusing on the past, present and future.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4fb3cf058f610003014","authors":["Gnanambal K, Mary Elizabeth","Lakshmipathy, Shailaja Vommi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.lfs.2016.02.034","first_seen_on":"2016-02-14T11:10:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-0631","00243205"],"journal":"Life Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1455715143,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26874035?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26874035?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0024320516300844"],"pmid":"26874035","pubdate":"2016-02-14T22:00:12+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology","physiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Dictyoceratidan poisons: Defined mark on microtubule-tubulin dynamics","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dictyoceratidan-poisons-defined-mark-microtubuletubulin-dynamics"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7206148,"mean":6.3472117046704,"rank":2916219,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4185282,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7206148,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":321457,"mean":9.7067741339402,"rank":122840,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":192659,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":321457,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1649,"mean":3.4249902912621,"rank":862,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":776,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1649,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102,"mean":1.5391089108911,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":85,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
