The daily activity pattern and use of space of 3 brown bears (Ursus arctos) were used for long-term macroevaluation of enrichment to compare the baseline and enrichment phases. Focal sampling methods were used for data collection, and instantaneous scans were made at 2-min intervals during 15 sessions of 1 hr for each animal during the 2 study periods. The enrichment devices were categorized as feeding, occupational, and sensorial. The long-term macroevaluation in 3 bears showed statistically significant differences in some types of activity but not in others. There were also statistically significant differences for the use of space in 4 of the 8 zones in which the enclosures were divided. A more homogenous pattern in the use of space was only observed during the enrichment phase in the old female. The 3 brown bears followed different patterns concerning the enrichment program.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d53cf058f610001064","authors":["Soriano, A.I.","Vinyoles Cartany\u00e0, Dolors","Mat\u00e9 Garc\u00eda, Carmen","Soriano, A.I.","Vinyoles Cartany\u00e0, Dolors","Mat\u00e9 Garc\u00eda, Carmen"],"doi":"10.1080\/10888705.2015.1106320","first_seen_on":"2017-03-08T15:55:10+00:00","handle":"2445\/108114","handles":["2445\/108114"],"issns":["1088-8705","1532-7604"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science","last_mentioned_on":1488987843,"links":["http:\/\/diposit.ub.edu\/dspace\/handle\/2445\/108114"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/diposit.ub.edu\/dspace\/bitstream\/2445\/108114\/1\/659418.pdf","pmid":"26709627","pubdate":"2015-12-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Taylor and Francis","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Long-Term Macroevaluation of Environmental Enrichment in Three Brown Bears (Ursus arctos) at Barcelona Zoo","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/10888705.2015.1106320","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/longterm-macroevaluation-environmental-enrichment-three-brown-bears-ursus-arctos-barcelona-zoo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8324953,"mean":7.0165383958894,"rank":7197996,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8324953,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242237,"mean":13.673425651018,"rank":201418,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242237,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":209,"mean":15.284298076923,"rank":183,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":209,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":10.975,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
