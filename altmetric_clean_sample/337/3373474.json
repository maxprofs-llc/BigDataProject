This is true of hybrid zones formed by two Banksia species of swamps and woodlands in south-eastern Australia, Banksia robur and B. oblongifolia. Both resprout after fire but recruitment is dependent on periodic fires. Although plants of intermediate morphology have also been identified as hybrids using allozyme markers, the extent of ongoing hybridization is unknown. This study investigates whether both microsatellite markers and morphological measurements can be used to distinguish between the two species and their hybrids. A recent recruitment event and microsatellite markers allow the frequency of ongoing hybridization to be estimated, and also the effects of environmental variation on the morphology of plants and seedlings to be tested.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002271","authors":["A.
