Distal revascularization-interval ligation (DRIL) has been established as a standard treatment procedure; however, an axial artery is ligated and the distal perfusion is maintained by the construction of an arterial bypass. Because such an approach, in principle, appears undesirable, we developed and applied an alternative technique referred to as proximalization of the arterial inflow (PAI). This procedure converts the arterial supply of the arteriovenous access to a more proximal artery with higher capacity by using a small-caliber polytetrafluoroethylene graft as a feeder.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f17","doi":"10.1016\/j.jvs.2006.01.025","first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T01:23:31+00:00","issns":["0741-5214"],"journal":"Journal of Vascular Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1242588126,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jvs.2006.01.025","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16765242"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jvascsurg.org\/article\/S0741521406002072\/pdf","pmid":"16765242","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Proximalization of the arterial inflow: a new technique to treat access-related ischemia.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/proximalization-arterial-inflow-new-technique-treat-accessrelated-ischemia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629728,"mean":4.9326084606411,"rank":816290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290773,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629728,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94038,"mean":8.0914304156877,"rank":24367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68590,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94038,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":895,"mean":2.0100648769575,"rank":105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":672,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":895,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":4.7385714285714,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
