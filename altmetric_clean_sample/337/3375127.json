To accomplish this, the virus has developed a variety of strategies to avoid detection by or obstruct specific aspects of the antiviral response whose consolidated action is antagonistic to virus survival. We describe two distinct viral strategies carried out by viral proteins with which myxoma virus subverts the host immune response. The first strategy is the production of virus-encoded proteins known as viroceptors or virokines that mimic host receptors or cytokines. These seek to actively block extracellular immune signals required for effective virus clearance and produce a local environment in the infected tissue that is \"virus friendly\". The second strategy, carried out by intracellular viral proteins, seeks to retard the innate antiviral responses such as apoptosis, and hinder attempts by the infected cell to communicate with the cellular arm of the immune system. By studying these viral strategies of immune evasion, the myxoma system can provide insights into virus-host interactions and also provide new insights into the complex immune system.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a98","authors":["P Nash","J Barrett","J X Cao","S Hota-Mitchell","A S Lalani","H Everett","X M Xu","J Robichaud","S Hnatiuk","C Ainslie","B T Seet","G McFadden"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T03:26:26+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0105-2896"],"journal":"Immunological Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1374581995,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10399068"],"pmid":"10399068","pubdate":"1999-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Immunomodulation by viruses: the myxoma virus story.","type":"article","volume":"168","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/immunomodulation-viruses-myxoma-virus-story"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632140,"mean":4.9249633348334,"rank":816015,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2293783,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632140,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94380,"mean":8.1091380073959,"rank":24538,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68755,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94380,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":419,"mean":2.3743875598086,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":211,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":419,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.8375,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
