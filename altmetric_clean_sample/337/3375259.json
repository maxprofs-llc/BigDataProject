To determine further the molecular genetic basis of CMO I deficiency, a patient of Turkish origin that suffered from CMO I deficiency was studied. Nucleotide sequencing of the PCR-amplified exons from the genomic DNA of this patient revealed a single point mutation CTG (leucine) CCG (proline) at codon 461 in exon 8 of CYP11B2, which is involved in the putative heme binding site of steroid 18-hydroxylase (P450(C18)). The expression study using a cDNA introducing the point mutation revealed that the amino acid substitution totally abolishes the P450(C18)p3 enzyme activities required for conversion of 11-deoxycorticosterone to aldosterone, even though the mutant product was detected in the mitochondrial fraction of the transfected cells. These results suggest that this point mutation causes CMO I deficiency.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","authors":["S Nomoto","G Massa","F Mitani","Y Ishimura","K Miyahara","K Toda","I Nagano","T Yamashiro","S Ogoshi","J Fukata","S Onishi","K Hashimoto","Y Doi","H Imura","Y Shizuta"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T03:30:22+00:00","issns":["0006-291X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1195417144,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9177280"],"pmid":"9177280","pubdate":"1997-05-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"CMO I deficiency caused by a point mutation in exon 8 of the human CYP11B2 gene encoding steroid 18-hydroxylase (P450C18).","type":"article","volume":"234","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cmo-i-deficiency-caused-point-mutation-exon-8-human-cyp11b2-gene-encoding-steroid-18hydroxylase-p450"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628371,"mean":4.9417862081361,"rank":817146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288196,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628371,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93830,"mean":8.0664477293802,"rank":24285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68471,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93830,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6517,"mean":2.5134981583794,"rank":216,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1948,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6517,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":141,"mean":1.1365428571429,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":141,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
