This study examines sex differences in the incidence of thyroid cancer. Ninety-five primary thyroid carcinomas (69 females, 26 males) diagnosed in those aged 0-24 during 1968-2005 were identified from the Northern Region Young Persons' Malignant Disease Registry. Age-standardised incidence rates (ASRs), rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. For males, the ASR was 0.6 per million person-years during the pre-Chernobyl period (1968-1986), and was 1.8 per million person-years during the post-Chernobyl period (1987-2005). For females, the ASR was 2.4 pre-Chernobyl and was 3.9 post-Chernobyl. The previously noted excess in Cumbria was entirely confined to females (Cumbrian females: RR for post-Chernobyl compared with pre-Chernobyl=10.8; 95% CI: 1.4-85.3). These findings may be consistent with sex-specific differences in susceptibility to an environmental exposure, such as fallout from the Chernobyl nuclear accident.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008e9a","authors":["Magnanti BL","Tevfik Dorak M","Parker L","Craft AW","James PW","McNally RJ"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ejca.2008.12.024","endpage":"1629","first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T02:58:41+00:00","issns":["0959-8049","09598049"],"issue":"9","journal":"European Journal of Cancer (1965)","last_mentioned_on":1477302971,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19179067","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19179067\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ejca.2008.12.024","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19179067"],"pmid":"19179067","pubdate":"2009-01-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1624","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Geographical analysis of thyroid cancer in young people from northern England: Evidence for a sustained excess in females in Cumbria","type":"article","volume":"45","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/geographical-analysis-thyroid-cancer-young-people-northern-england-evidence-sustained-excess-females"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8102415,"mean":6.8892140789079,"rank":2041428,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4953409,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8102415,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239100,"mean":8.2701564038327,"rank":68537,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":165088,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239100,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2004,"mean":5.0670274588118,"rank":511,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":1039,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2004,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":9.9340634920635,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Belle de Jour (writer)","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=463059064#altmetric_citation_4","license":"public","citation_ids":[3374265,3374265],"posted_on":"2016-10-24T09:56:11+00:00","summary":"How to find escorts in London in very Cheap rates!.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=5774889","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Eithan smith","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Eithan smith"}}]}}
