We previously showed that the C5b-9 assembly during complement activation induces cell cycle in human aortic EC (AEC) and SMC. C5b-9 can induce the expression of Response Gene to Complement (RGC)-32 and over expression of this gene leads to cell cycle activation. Therefore, the present study was carried out to test the requirement of endogenous RGC-32 for the cell cycle activation induced by C5b-9 by knocking-down its expression using siRNA. We identified two RGC-32 siRNAs that can markedly reduce the expression of RGC-32 mRNA in AEC. RGC-32 silencing in these cells abolished DNA synthesis induced by C5b-9 and serum growth factors, indicating the requirement of RGC-32 activity for S-phase entry. RGC-32 siRNA knockdown also significantly reduced the C5b-9 induced CDC2 activation and Akt phosphorylation. CDC2 does not play a role in G1\/S transition in HeLa cells stably overexpressing RGC-32. RGC-32 was found to physically associate with Akt and was phosphorylated by Akt in vitro. Mutation of RGC-32 protein at Ser 45 and Ser 47 prevented Akt mediated phosphorylation. In addition, RGC-32 was found to regulate the release of growth factors from AEC. All these data together suggest that cell cycle induction by C5b-9 in AEC is RGC-32 dependent and this is in part through regulation of Akt and growth factor release.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000288e","doi":"10.1016\/j.yexmp.2008.12.005","first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T04:09:59+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Experimental & Molecular Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1307262349,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.yexmp.2008.12.005","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19162005","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2699899"],"pmid":"19162005","pubdate":"2009-01-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","pathology"],"title":"Response Gene to Complement 32 is Required for C5b-9 Induced Cell Cycle Activation in Endothelial Cells","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/response-gene-complement-32-required-c5b9-induced-cell-cycle-activation-endothelial-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627464,"mean":4.9483847763613,"rank":817643,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2286498,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627464,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93607,"mean":8.0230409161807,"rank":24197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68334,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93607,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":183,"mean":1.8547802197802,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":126,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":183,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.4233846153846,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
