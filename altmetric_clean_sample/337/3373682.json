Gut epithelial cells express specific receptors for PYY, PYY induces proliferation in intestinal cells in vivo and in vitro, and the Y1 receptor subtype couples to mitogenic signaling pathways. In addition to proposed physiologic effects on gut mucosal maintenance, PYY proliferative effects may be hypothesized to contribute to pathophysiologic consequences of stimulated growth.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032be","authors":["Peter J Mannon"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T02:43:33+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0196-9781"],"issue":"2","journal":"Peptides","last_mentioned_on":1202588467,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11825653"],"pmid":"11825653","pubdate":"2002-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Peptide YY as a growth factor for intestinal epithelium.","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/peptide-yy-growth-factor-intestinal-epithelium-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626860,"mean":4.9517239589446,"rank":817844,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2285531,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626860,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93460,"mean":8.0077962101029,"rank":24132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68249,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93460,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":518,"mean":2.319752417795,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":518,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.9842105263158,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
