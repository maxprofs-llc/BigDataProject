The regulation of hepcidin expression by iron loading appears to be unexpectedly complex and has attracted much interest. The GPI-linked membrane protein hemojuvelin (GPI-hemojuvelin) is an essential upstream regulator of hepcidin expression. A soluble form of hemojuvelin (s-hemojuvelin) exists in blood and acts as antagonist of GPI-hemojuvelin to downregulate hepcidin expression. The release of s-hemojuvelin is negatively regulated by both transferrin-bound iron (holo-Tf) and non-transferrin-bound iron (FAC), indicating s-hemojuvelin could be one of the mediators of hepcidin regulation by iron. In this report, we investigate the proteinase involved in the release of s-hemojuvelin and show that s-hemojuvelin is released by a proprotein convertase through the cleavage at a conserved polybasic RNRR site.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000240d","authors":["Lan Lin","Elizabeta Nemeth","Julia B.
