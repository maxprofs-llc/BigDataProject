This method, which refers to the combination of both quantitative and qualitative methods in the same study, allowed the authors to obtain more comprehensive and robust data than could be obtained by either method alone. A convenience sample of 110 persons with CFS completed the quality of life index and CFS questionnaire, and a subset of 22 persons were interviewed regarding their lived experience with CFS. Overall scores on the quality of life index were significantly lower in CFS than for other chronic illness groups. Subjects reported the lowest quality of life scores in health and functioning domain. Indepth interviews provided a more complete understanding of the quality of life in CFS and further explained the low ratings that were found on the quality of life index. The findings suggest that quality of life is particularly and uniquely disrupted in CFS.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e6f","authors":["J S Anderson","C E Ferrans","Anderson, J S","Ferrans, C E"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T03:03:53+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["0022-3018"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Nervous & Mental Disease","last_mentioned_on":1500577481,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9205421","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9205421"],"pmid":"9205421","pubdate":"1997-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychiatry","neurology"],"title":"The quality of life of persons with chronic fatigue syndrome.","type":"article","volume":"185","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quality-life-persons-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-6"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12.25,"score_history":{"1y":12.25,"6m":12.25,"3m":12.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8250328,"mean":6.9709426969313,"rank":685813,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7560481,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8250328,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240402,"mean":8.3069669260944,"rank":25474,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":214759,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240402,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2089,"mean":4.2918448275862,"rank":88,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":2000,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2089,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":6.0437916666667,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":16,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":16,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
