Kassinin, like all other natural tachykinins, possesses the characteristic C-terminal tripeptide Gly-Leu-Met-NH2 and a phenylalanine residue in position 5 from the C-terminus. However, the amino acid sequence in the N-moiety of the molecule differs sharply from that of the other tachykinins.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6fb3cf058f61000a38c","authors":["A Anastasi","P Montecucchi","V Erspamer","J Visser"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T04:17:01+00:00","issns":["0014-4754"],"issue":"7","journal":"Experientia","last_mentioned_on":1305421301,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/891753"],"pmid":"891753","pubdate":"1977-07-15T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["science"],"title":"Amino acid composition and sequence of kassinin, a tachykinin dodecapeptide from the skin of the African frog Kassina senegalensis.","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/amino-acid-composition-sequence-kassinin-tachykinin-dodecapeptide-skin-african-frog-kassina-senegale"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3619418,"mean":4.9283821178971,"rank":815648,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2280091,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3619418,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92288,"mean":7.15265666887,"rank":23368,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":67848,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92288,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283,"mean":2.5578865248227,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":84,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
