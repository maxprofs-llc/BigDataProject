Sixteen structurally unrelated phenobarbital-type inducers activated the 51-bp enhancer element in transient transfection assays. The results thus indicate that most PB-type inducers, if not all inducers, increase the transcription of the CYP2B10 gene by activating this 51-bp element, now designated PB-responsive enhancer module or PBREM.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081e7","authors":["P Honkakoski","R Moore","K A Washburn","M Negishi"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T03:35:41+00:00","issns":["0026-895X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Molecular Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1418998238,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9547348"],"pmid":"9547348","pubdate":"1998-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","pharmacology"],"title":"Activation by diverse xenochemicals of the 51-base pair phenobarbital-responsive enhancer module in the CYP2B10 gene.","type":"article","volume":"53","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/activation-diverse-xenochemicals-51base-pair-phenobarbitalresponsive-enhancer-module-cyp2b10-gene"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691600,"mean":5.434115338552,"rank":1091324,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":3022329,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691600,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":158173,"mean":8.7991065169563,"rank":46125,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":110016,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":158173,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1088,"mean":2.7040423183073,"rank":113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":557,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1088,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.5239130434783,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
