In addition to early intubation for upper-airway protection, subsequent critical care of patients who have this injury should be directed at maintaining distal airway patency. High-frequency ventilation, inhaled heparin, and aggressive pulmonary toilet are among the therapies available. Even so, immunosuppression, intubation, and airway damage predispose these patients to pneumonia and other complications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6123cf058f610006f2a","doi":"10.1016\/j.cps.2009.05.013","first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T04:41:39+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Clinics in Plastic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1325062561,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.cps.2009.05.013","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19793551"],"pmid":"19793551","pubdate":"2009-10-02T23:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Airway management and smoke inhalation injury in the burn patient.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/airway-management-smoke-inhalation-injury-burn-patient-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629728,"mean":4.9326084606411,"rank":816295,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290725,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629728,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94031,"mean":8.0913819206639,"rank":24364,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68586,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94031,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107,"mean":1.6130754716981,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
